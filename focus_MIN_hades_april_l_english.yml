# Focus
  MIN_starting_1:0 "The Bitter Defeat"
  MIN_starting_1_desc:0 "We are not graceful losers."
  MIN_starting_2:0 "Something Feels Off"
  MIN_starting_2_desc:0 "This must be the Overworld but why does it look so... wrong?"

  MIN_starting_3:0 "Villagers?"
  MIN_starting_3_desc:0 "They look and sound like twisted villagers. We must be on the right track."
  MIN_starting_4:0 "A Pig Instead of A Bear"
  MIN_starting_4_desc:0 "The last of the villagers here are dead or ran away. It’s not much but this land is ours."

  MIN_side_1:0 "Fellow Mobs"
  MIN_side_1_desc:0 "They look different and some of them are glowing but they’re definitely zombies. They’re natural allies against the villagers and players."
  MIN_side_2:0 "The Deep Horde"
  MIN_side_2_desc:0 "There is another mob horde nearby, dwelling in deep tunnels. Their king Morghorl seems to have as little love for villagers as us. Pigs and Moles should stand together."
  MIN_side_3:0 "Taming Wolves"
  MIN_side_3_desc:0 "Wolves make as good friends for Piglins as they do players."
  MIN_side_4:0 "Riches of the Overworld"
  MIN_side_4_desc:0 "Shiny is shiny, even if it’s not a block. If it looks valuable, toss it in the treasury."
  MIN_side_5:0 "Pigheaded"
  MIN_side_5_desc:0 "If the villagers and players think we’ll back down they’ve got another thing coming."
  MIN_side_6:0 "Redstone Track"
  MIN_side_6_desc:0 "The terrain in this Overworld is almost worse than the Nether. Nothing elevated cart tracks can’t fix though."

  MIN_industry_1:0 "Bricks From Home"
  MIN_industry_1_desc:0 "This cursed ground is impossible to build with, we’ll have to bring our own to get anything done."
  MIN_industry_2:0 "A Bigger Fortress Is A Better Fortress"
  MIN_industry_2_desc:0 "At least things are normal back in the Nether. It would be best to build up our fortress back there to keep supplies moving."
  MIN_industry_3:0 "More Swords"
  MIN_industry_3_desc:0 "There’s definitely weapons here but none of them make sense. Our army needs proper swords not these strange looking crossbows or whatever they are."
  MIN_industry_4:0 "Slap Some Redstone On It"
  MIN_industry_4_desc:0 "There’s contraptions here that react to redstone, a fine opportunity to experiment. Maybe we can make a computer!"
  MIN_industry_5:0 "Keep It Coming"
  MIN_industry_5_desc:0 "Brick is better but we need more! Ship in all the Netherrack you can find; we can’t afford to slow down."
  MIN_industry_6:0 "You Can Eat This?"
  MIN_industry_6_desc:0 "Some of the more adventurous or desperate soldiers have been sampling some of the local mats. The ones that survived reported finding some that are actually edible. "
  MIN_industry_7:0 "Goodbye Stone Tools"
  MIN_industry_7_desc:0 "Though it looks disturbing, we’ve discovered a healthy supply of iron in this overworld. Finally we can ditch the stone."
  MIN_industry_8:0 "A Breakthrough"
  MIN_industry_8_desc:0 "We just might be able to start using some of the local materials for building, copying some of what we’ve seen the enemy villagers do. Still no match for blocks though."
  MIN_industry_9:0 "Feed The Machine"
  MIN_industry_9_desc:0 " Portal Fortress is still key to the war effort and probably always will be. It needs to be even bigger!"
  MIN_industry_10:0 "Diamonds!"
  MIN_industry_10_desc:0 "We didn’t even have to dig that deep for them!"
  MIN_industry_11:0 "Take Their Drops"
  MIN_industry_11_desc:0 "Yes the enemies weapons look and feel wrong, but a flaming sword is a flaming sword whether it’s curved or not."
  MIN_industry_12:0 "Hitting The Build Limit"
  MIN_industry_12_desc:0 "We can squeeze a few more floors into Portal Fortress, just watch us!"
  MIN_industry_13:0 "Waste Not Want Not"
  MIN_industry_13_desc:0 "The further we get from the portal the less picky we can afford to be. Use whatever you can."
  MIN_industry_14:0 "Is This Enchanted?"
  MIN_industry_14_desc:0 "Some of the local weapons are pretty impressive actually. This one’s a TNT launcher!"
  MIN_industry_15:0 "Better Inventories"
  MIN_industry_15_desc:0 "Our warriors need to be ready for this strange and hideous land. They need better loadouts."
  MIN_industry_16:0 "Blocks! Finally!"
  MIN_industry_16_desc:0 "We can fix this world, all it takes is some magic to turn it all into blocks. There’s an almost infinite supply of irradiated soil blocks now. Those are probably safe."

  MIN_political_1:0 "Speedrun To War"
  MIN_political_1_desc:0 "Some of these villagers have hard bits, almost like there’s iron jammed into them. Weird."
  MIN_political_2:0 "How Many Villages Are There?"
  MIN_political_2_desc:0 "The hills nearby are full of villages. They probably work for the kingdom and even if they don’t we should get them under hoof."
  MIN_political_3:0 "Golembreakers"
  MIN_political_3_desc:0 "Scouts report seeing golems moving around down the way. We’re gonna need some heavier weapons."
  MIN_political_4:0 "The Golem War"
  MIN_political_4_desc:0 "These villagers are tough. They’ve got a lot of golems and some enchanted weapons. The horde is tougher."
  MIN_political_5:0 "Clearing Leftovers"
  MIN_political_5_desc:0 "They’ll run out of villagers eventually, just need to keep clearing them out."
  MIN_political_6:0 "What’s an America?"
  MIN_political_6_desc:0 "I don’t know but I wish they’d stop yelling about it."
  MIN_political_7:0 "Smart As A Pig"
  MIN_political_7_desc:0 "Nobody is smarter."
  MIN_political_8:0 "Unsafehaven"
  MIN_political_8_desc:0 "These villagers built underground, with a lot of iron. We should take it. All of it."
  MIN_political_9:0 "Hiring Local Mobs"
  MIN_political_9_desc:0 "The Overworld has mobs of its own and they’re natural allies no matter how awful they look. These mutants can find a home in the horde."
  MIN_political_10:0 "Zombies Sighted"
  MIN_political_10_desc:0 "The land ahead is full of what look to be zombies, if we can humble them they’d make for good rotten meat shield troops."
  MIN_political_11:0 "Last Of The Golems"
  MIN_political_11_desc:0 "Some of the golems have villagers in them, which is downright unnatural. We need to destroy every last one. "
  MIN_political_12:0 "The Road to the Kingdom"
  MIN_political_12_desc:0 "Finally we’re on the right trail, the Kingdom is that way! We just need to roll over another couple dozen villages in the way."
  MIN_political_13:0 "Keep Your Heads Down"
  MIN_political_13_desc:0 "Maybe we should get rid of less of the villagers and see if they stop trying to resist constantly. They better not be grumbling and sighing all the time though."
  MIN_political_14:0 "The Showdown"
  MIN_political_14_desc:0 "This is where our rivals must have gone in this cursed map even if they look a bit different. Time for revenge!"
  MIN_political_15:0 "Mob Alliance"
  MIN_political_15_desc:0 "All kinds of mobs and oddities have started wandering in to join us, most from lands we’ve never heard of. We can always use more workers."
  MIN_political_16:0 "The Fallen Kingdom"
  MIN_political_16_desc:0 "Revenge is sweet, and finally we have it. Surely there is no one left who could possibly challenge us, time to throw our weight around."

  MIN_army_1:0 "A Horde With Discipline"
  MIN_army_1_desc:0 "Run at the enemy all together, not one at a time!"
  MIN_army_2:0 "Villager Hunting Squads"
  MIN_army_2_desc:0 "Putting new soldiers to work tracking down holdout villagers will get them some hands on experience before they go to the front lines."
  MIN_army_3:0 "Loot Stashes"
  MIN_army_3_desc:0 "Well they’re not going to need them anymore."
  MIN_army_4:0 "Hogs Or Tall Men"
  MIN_army_4_desc:0 "We could get a portal to The End open and hire some Endermen but they hate how the Hoglins stare. A choice must be made."
  MIN_army_5:0 "Enchanting Arms"
  MIN_army_5_desc:0 "We found a building full of books, more than enough to set up some enchanting stations."
  MIN_army_6:0 "Magic Weapons"
  MIN_army_6_desc:0 "Not much cuts through a villager or their golems better than a magic sword."
  MIN_army_7:0 "Flanking Tactics"
  MIN_army_7_desc:0 "If you run two groups at the enemy from different directions  at the same time you’ll be able to trap them!"
  MIN_army_8:0 "Putting Heads Together"
  MIN_army_8_desc:0 "We’re getting used to how the villagers here fight, studying them should give us an edge."
  MIN_army_9:0 "New Potions"
  MIN_army_9_desc:0 "They must have witches here somewhere, as we’ve found more than a few potions lying around. A couple seem pretty useful."
  MIN_army_10:0 "Crafting A Better Horde"
  MIN_army_10_desc:0 "The best army in all worlds needs the best gear. Break out the workbenches."
  MIN_army_11:0 "The Shock Troops"
  MIN_army_11_desc:0 "Our shock troops have proven their worth in the wars against the villagers. They’ve earned some rewards."
  MIN_army_12:0 "TNT"
  MIN_army_12_desc:0 "The urge to set it all off at once is terrible."
  MIN_army_13:0 "Remember to Have Fun"
  MIN_army_13_desc:0 "War is like a hunt, and why not celebrate with a dance or two after a successful battle?"
  MIN_army_14:0 "Top Tier Gear"
  MIN_army_14_desc:0 "Every piglin, a diamond enchanted blade in hand."

  MIN_air_1:0 "The Elytra Force"
  MIN_air_1_desc:0 "It's been pointed out that the Overworld has no ceilings. We should take advantage of that endless skybox."
  MIN_air_2:0 "The Pigs Fly"
  MIN_air_2_desc:0 "You heard me. Anything is possible."
  MIN_air_3:0 "A New Elytraport"
  MIN_air_3_desc:0 "Our gliders need a better launching point than a burnt out field. Get to building!"
  MIN_air_4:0 "Enchanted Elytra"
  MIN_air_4_desc:0 "Better, faster, further, tougher. Magic can do anything."
  MIN_naval_1:0 "Watercraft"
  MIN_naval_1_desc:0 "The water is one of the few things that looks almost normal here, even if getting a block of it seems nearly impossible. We know what to do with water."
  MIN_naval_2:0 "River Explorers"
  MIN_naval_2_desc:0 "Our sailors need practice so get them out there. Maybe we’ll find some shipwrecks."
  MIN_naval_3:0 "Port of the Horde"
  MIN_naval_3_desc:0 "The further we go the more water we find. We’re gonna need more boats."
  MIN_naval_4:0 "Metal Boats"
  MIN_naval_4_desc:0 "Who could have imagined you could build boats out of something other than wood?"

  #Events
  nf_min.1.t:0 "The Obsidian Portal"
  nf_min.1.d:0 "When Baron Bailey had heard the news, he could scarcely believe it. Eyewitnesses spoke of great purple portals erupting from the ground. A mad army of pig warriors spewing endlessly, ferociously attacking all that they could \n\n’Clearly some rabble rousers had gotten the people into a stir, no doubt those silly khans up north’. Was what Bailey had believed. Until a pigs' blade cut through him. This land was now under Hades control."
  nf_min.1.a:0 "What in the goddamn?"

  nf_min.101.t:0 "Overworld Invasion"
  nf_min.101.d:0 "Finally, after all these years we're finally..... wait...."
  nf_min.101.a:0 "Where.... where are we?"

  nf_min.2.t:0 "The Horde Of Hades"
  nf_min.2.d:0 "Defeat leaves lasting impacts on those who feel its cold embrace and the scars of defeat run deep within our people’s blood. \n\nLong ago, after a bitter conflict, an evil most foul saw fit to banish us to the depths of the nether. Within that difficult realm, we fought and bled to survive. We built our arms, we trained our men. We rebuilt the portals. Our blood feud would be settled, we would have our revenge. \n\nExcept... Things here aren’t exactly as we remember. The blocks of home are non-existent here. The players here seem a lot sadder than the ones we remember, and they don’t seem to recognize us nor even fear us. It seems that we failed to set up the portals correctly and we have been led to an entirely new land. "
  nf_min.2.a:0 "Who set up the portal? I want their heads!"

  nf_min.3.t:0 "The New Dimension"
  nf_min.3.d:0 "It seems, in our haste, we were tricked. The player Kingdom sent us to another realm. An all too familiar fate they once pushed upon us. But we are tenacious. Let them try their silly tricks, they shall only delay the inevitable. Until then, we shall conquer and we shall grow. We may be in a different world from home, but it is of no matter. We shall have vengeance for our people! There are vast amounts of villages near, begging to be raided. We shall build our way back to victory."
  nf_min.3.a:0 "To Battle!"

  nf_min.4.t:0 "Spend Gold Wisely"
  nf_min.4.d:0 "In this chaotic land, we must keep up and adapt our forces so we can survive and return home. Our military must grow and diversify. We have two valuable choices that we can select to fund. Quick and versatile Hoglin Riders or bringing more of those terrifying Endermen. We must select one."
  nf_min.4.a:0 "Who doesn't love hoglins?"
  nf_min.4.b:0 "I hate those creepy Ender stares...."

  nf_min.5.t:0 "The Last Day Of Cookie"
  nf_min.5.d:0 "The Kingdom has been felled, its forces scattered and in disarray. Hades had once again led his Legion to victory. All that was left was to see the Kingdoms leader. \n\n”You have failed. Accept your defeat and surrender your remaining forces.” Hades roared, his voice dripping with pride. \n\n”Meow” Cookie said. \n\n”You insolent being! You dare question me?” Hades roared. \n\n”Meow” Cookie said. \n\nHades roared again, slamming his sword into the desk. \n\n”I don’t think you understand!” He screamed. Cookie looked at the sword curiously and began to tap it with his paw. Never had there been a creature that defied Hades so easily. Clearly this beast would prove a valuable asset to have when their next crusade would begin."
  nf_min.5.a:0 ""He is not cute! He is clearly a proven warrior!""

  nf_min.6.t:0 "Reaching Out To Those Below"
  nf_min.6.d:0 "We are in a strange land, amidst strange beings. Threats surround us from every angle. Yet one of our border nations need not be our enemy. The monster-men below us understand all too clear the dangers these villagers pose. Serval of our troopers have considered sending a delegation to them and convincing them to join our crusade. If they don’t join us, we can always show them the sword."
  nf_min.6.a:0 "Surely they will aid us."

  nf_min.7.t:0 "Delegation Of Piglins"
  nf_min.7.d:0 "The strange newcomers to the north arrived today. Despite their strange blocky forms we allowed them into our outposts to hear what they had to say. They claim to be from a dimension deep below us, the "nether", and they want to ally with us to defeat the "villagers". It's pretty odd. What should we tell them?"
  nf_min.7.a:0 "Perhaps we can aid each other."
  nf_min.7.b:0 "These mines are ours!"

  nf_min.8.t:0 "Alliance Accepted"
  nf_min.8.d:0 "The monster-men accept our alliance! Together we will conquer this land and take ever block of gold and diamond together!"
  nf_min.8.a:0 "Piglin and Molemen Together"

  nf_min.9.t:0 "Alliance Rejected"
  nf_min.9.d:0 "The monster-men rejected our alliance? But why? This will not stand! The horde of Hades will crush them!"
  nf_min.9.a:0 "This means war!"
