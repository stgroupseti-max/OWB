  shared_vault_1_name_key:0 ""Prepared for the Future!""
  shared_vault_1_desc:0 "[shared_vault_1_focus_desc_loc]"
  shared_vault_1_desc_key:0 "The Bombs were coming, one way or another, and no one was more ready for it than Vault-Tec! Our Vault was one of many that stood ready to ride out the storm and keep our ancestors safe until the world was ready to be rebuilt. Not all vaults were created equal however, and there's always that burning question: What kind of vault was yours?"

  shared_vault_2_name_key:0 ""Reserve Your Space Today!""
  shared_vault_2_desc:0 "[shared_vault_2_focus_desc_loc]"
  shared_vault_2_desc_key:0 "Every Vault needs to one day make some very tough decisions. The geiger counter may still be ticking, but that door just might need to be opened anyway! Vault-Tec may have been prepared for anything, but people and supplies can still run quite scarce after 200 years underground."

  shared_vault_3_desc:0 "[shared_vault_3_focus_desc_loc]"
  shared_vault_3_desc_key:0 "Even if we don't want the wasteland, the wasteland just might want us! Just as Vault-Tec prepared for the future, we'll need to do the same. Whether we shield ourselves from it, befriend it, or maybe tame it ourselves, it's time for that brighter future Vault-Tec promised!"

  shared_vault_maintenance:0 "The Vault's Maintenance Teams"
  shared_vault_maintenance_desc:0 "While Vaults are highly automated and built to high standards there'd be nothing left but rusted corridors without the Vault-Tec Maintenance Team!\n\nIt's time we encourage our young dwellers to take up their soldering tools and join the team to keep the Vault on a steady track to perfection."

  shared_vault_industry_bonus:0 "Conveyor Belts"
  shared_vault_industry_bonus_desc:0 "A steady flow of production is key to keeping our dwellers happy and our Vault profitable. If we want to ensure we are titans of industry in the wasteland we'll have to assign more of our real estate to highly advanced and automated workshops."

  shared_vault_resource_collection:0 "Happy Work Is Hard Work"
  shared_vault_resource_collection_desc:0 "The great minds in the Vault-Tec Human Relations branch have devised a new campaign to get our dwellers back on their feet and working!\n\nWe will create an artificial atmosphere of competition between the Vault's families by rewarding the hardest working dweller of the month one day of extra pay!"

  shared_vault_maintenance_infrastructure:0 "Expanding the Vault"
  shared_vault_maintenance_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our residential facilities are quickly filling up and will soon have no more space for future generations. It would be wise to begin excavating future real estate if we wish to avoid a crisis."

  shared_vault_maintenance_repairs:0 "Quinquennial Checklist"
  shared_vault_maintenance_repairs_desc:0 "Some people say we should check these more often, but the official Vault-Tec Vault Maintenance Manual says once every 5 years, so...."

  shared_vault_generator:0 "The Powers to Be"
  shared_vault_generator_desc:0 "[Root.GetName] isn't going to survive off of just an old pre-war generator forever. Why not try and upgrade it or look for power elsewhere?"

  shared_vault_reading_about_boats:0 "Inspirations In Literature"
  shared_vault_reading_about_boats_desc:0 ""To give up the insupportable yoke of the land which men equate with freedom is perhaps not such a great sacrifice as you may imagine." - Captain Nemo, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea "

  shared_vault_building_dockyards:0 "Beginning Shipbuilding Practices"
  shared_vault_building_dockyards_desc:0 "All the theoretical knowledge in nautical construction can now find practical application at our newly constructed shipyards. Imagine, going to sea like the great explorers of old!"

  shared_vault_ocean_vaults:0 "Vaults Of The Seas"
  shared_vault_ocean_vaults_desc:0 "Our first few forays into the waters of the wastes has taught us that bigger is better. After all, much like our Vault homes, they need to provide a solid roof and four walls to protect us from the threats of man and nature. And it stops them swaying around quite so much...."

  shared_vault_bikes:0 "Longer Than Hallways"
  shared_vault_bikes_desc:0 "The Vaults are comfortably sized. The surface, on the other hand, requires a bit more walking to get anywhere. A simple set of wheels can help us get to new settlements faster. It also can count towards exercise requirements!"

  shared_vault_cars:0 "Much More Travel Time"
  shared_vault_cars_desc:0 " While fitness is a vital part of our lifestyle, maybe a few refurbished wheels can save us some time?"

  shared_vault_water_chip:0 "Our Water Chips"
  shared_vault_water_chip_desc:0 "While we have heard long lost tales of Vault Dwellers heroically exiting their Vault and sacrificing themselves to find water chips we were luckily given an adequate supply of them.\n\nThe scientists have proposed to build even more water plants to better utilize our stockpile of chips, truly genius at work."

  shared_vault_resource_capstone:0 "Titans of Industry"
  shared_vault_resource_capstone_desc:0 "Vault-Tec is no longer calling for efficiency in our industry! In a short period of time we've rivalled expected predictions by 231.5%! A true accomplishment every Vault Dweller can be proud of having helped in."

  #air side branch

  shared_vault_civilian_factory:0 "Machine Over Man"
  shared_vault_civilian_factory_desc:0 "Our data analysts have calculated that by replacing some of our production line with purpose-built Protectrons we could nearly double our efficiency. Who needs pesky labourers that ask for vacations and can't even work twenty-four hours a day?"

  shared_vault_military_protectrons:0 "Machine In Front Of Man"
  shared_vault_military_protectrons_desc:0 "Protectrons are actually quite good at protecting us from incoming fire. And they even fire back!"

  shared_vault_air_bonus:0 "Ancestral Aviation"
  shared_vault_air_bonus_desc:0 "Our American ancestors once roamed the skies freely and without worry. Now the most you'll see in the smoggy and green sky is a mutant crow...\n\nLet's bring back the glory days and teach our youth to pilot our most modern planes, after all this could come in handy for future warfare."

  shared_vault_air_tech_bonus:0 "Excellent Aeronauts"
  shared_vault_air_tech_bonus_desc:0 "It seems that our campaign to instill the passion of aviation into our youth has taken hold. There's just one problem: all we have are rickety biplanes and 21st century relics.\n\nIf we truly want to control the skies we must advance the technology we provide to our aeronauts or we'll be shot down by pipe rifles."

  shared_vault_air_base_bonus:0 "Castle in the Sky"
  shared_vault_air_base_bonus_desc:0 "Now that our air force is a formidable opponent to anyone who roams the skies we have one final issue: air bases. If we don't assign some of our dwellers to finding clearing in the land and building airstrips our airforce will have no chance at launching anything more than a glider."

  #security branch

  shared_vault_security:0 "The Vault's Security Teams"
  shared_vault_security_desc:0 "While we trust that all Vault Dwellers will be good upstanding members of the community, having insurance has never gone wrong.\n\nOur Security Team stands for law and order and protects us from both outside and inner threats and is a staple of our Vault."

  shared_vault_security_organization:0 "Printing More Uniforms"
  shared_vault_security_organization_desc:0 "Besides being comfortable, rugged and fashionable, Vault-Tec security uniforms help distinguish our forces from the lawless wastelanders. We'll need to ramp up production to keep up with modern needs."

  shared_vault_identification:0 "Assign New VIDs"
  shared_vault_identification_desc:0 "Vault identification numbers are given to every dweller when their birth is registered. Luckily with 11 whole digits to utilized this system can be expanded to newcomers to our society easily. We just need to make them fill out the proper paperwork and bring it by the office between 10 and 2."

  shared_vault_security_gaming:0 "Playing Some War Games"
  shared_vault_security_gaming_desc:0 "Some have said that games are an excellent way to train the mind to think strategically. We're pretty sure those folks just want to slack off. And even if it is true, isn't it about 200 years too late for Atomic Command holotapes to be useful?"

  shared_vault_air_land_teamwork:0 "No "I" In Teamwork"
  shared_vault_air_land_teamwork_desc:0 "There is a lot of work though, and today we're focused on getting the security team and the aeronauts on the same page."

  shared_vault_security_equipment:0 "Man the Guns"
  shared_vault_security_equipment_desc:0 "While our Security Team has been doing excellent work they lack the required fire power to properly manage any serious threats.\n\nIt would be wise to assign some of our civilian workforce to temporarily make more armaments for our officers."

  shared_vault_security_boon:0 "Zirconium Pants"
  shared_vault_security_boon_desc:0 "Now that our Security Team has adequate fire power we can focus on other issues with it, primarily the lack of armour.\n\nOur scientists have been hard at work in their labs working on a compound known as "Zirconium" which could be used in ballistic vests due to its ideal material properties."

  shared_vault_security_recruitment:0 "Dwelling Defenders"
  shared_vault_security_recruitment_desc:0 "The great minds at Vault-Tec gathered together and fixed all the issues we had with our Security Team's equipment, now it's up the great speakers.\n\nEvery dweller respects the Security Team but few want to join it, surely if we show them the benefits behind the job they'd sign up immediately!"

  shared_vault_arms_factory:0 "Astounding Ammunition"
  shared_vault_arms_factory_desc:0 "Our production lines consist of trinkets and civilian goods, it's time we step in and reassign some plants purely to the manufacturing of firearms. Our enemies will know the dedication of our dwellers once the lead projectiles we manufactured pierce their skull."

  shared_vault_doctrine_bonus:0 "Drilling Dwellers"
  shared_vault_doctrine_bonus_desc:0 "Should war ever reach the outskirts of our Vault every man, woman and child must be prepared to face the wrath of our enemies.\n\nSecurity Chief McKay has agreed to drill folk of all ages in the art of warfare to help us face the enemy."

  shared_vault_arms_factory_2:0 "Expanding Firearm Production"
  shared_vault_arms_factory_2_desc:0 "The effort we put forward to build further weapons manufacturing plants has paid off. However we can always push the production line further, our scouts have spotted land clearings that would be the perfect location to set up armament workshops."

  shared_vault_outward_movements:0 "Ring of Fire"
  shared_vault_outward_movements_desc:0 "The Security Team is stronger than even some of the most elite pre-war organizations thanks to our dedication to arming and overhauling them.\nThe final step in our plan will simply be riling up our forces and painting the enemy as an alien force with no human emotion behind it so our men show them no remorse."

  #vault science branch

  shared_vault_doctors:0 "The Vault's Science Teams"
  shared_vault_doctors_desc:0 "The Vault Science Teams are the most crucial pillar in securing our future in the wasteland.\nVault-Tec's best and brightest were sent to our vault to be utilized! Not just to be sitting around testing on lab mice.\nIf we are to continue sailing on a steady path of technological stability we must make sure our scientists are well-funded."

  shared_vault_stimpaks:0 "Stocking Up on Stimpaks"
  shared_vault_stimpaks_desc:0 "While our Vault provides some of the most high quality care in the wasteland there are still issues in our supply line. Stimpaks and Med-X are rare finds for our scavengers and we currently don't have any way of producing them. Setting the Science Team's objective to recreating the stimpak formula would help immensely."

  shared_vault_support_bonus:0 "100% Condition"
  shared_vault_support_bonus_desc:0 "Our Pip-Boys are built in with devices able to track both flora and fauna, why don't we encourage our dwellers to get rid of pests like radroaches by rewarding them for killing 50 of them! I'm sure these little traits will keep our Dwellers motivated to deal with pests."

  shared_vault_future_warfare:0 "The Future Of Warfare"
  shared_vault_future_warfare_desc:0 "Some white coats with their heads in the clouds dream of an age where everyone in the community gets their own plasma pistol.\n\nFor now we'll probably have to make do with refurbished laser rifles."

  shared_vault_super_security:0 "Theorizing Super Security"
  shared_vault_super_security_desc:0 "The American military was at the cutting edge of advancements in warfare before the bombs dropped. If we could recover and integrate some of their technology and manuals, we could place our best performing security members into unstoppable elite units."

  shared_vault_scientists:0 "Vigilant Recycler"
  shared_vault_scientists_desc:0 "Vault-Tec has invested far too many materials into wacky larger than life experiments done by spiky white haired scientists. If we want to actually create useful technology that isn't a radroach that can talk then we'll have to work on scrapping some of the more eccentric research projects."

  shared_vault_research_bonus:0 "Nerd Rage!"
  shared_vault_research_bonus_desc:0 "It seems that our scientists have finally found their ticket to working less. They've built a computer that runs thousands of experiments to see which ones should be trashed due to their insanity...\n\nWould've been better to have less mad scientists but this will expedite things, I guess?"

  shared_vault_expanding_goat:0 "Expanding The G.O.A.T."
  shared_vault_expanding_goat_desc:0 "The G.O.A.T. has helped generations of our children find an exciting and fulfilling career (more often than not). But now that we're on the surface there's a lot of jobs it just didn't account for. So the science crew has worked with our teachers to create 20 new questions to add to the test. The teens will be so cranked!"

  shared_vault_radar_time:0 "Upscaled Motion Sensors"
  shared_vault_radar_time_desc:0 "The Wattz Electronics C-U Model motion sensor is an add on for older model Pipboys. Taking them apart and then putting them back together, but much larger, would help us see enemies approaching long before they reach us."

  shared_vault_research_bonus_upgrade:0 "Downloading RAM"
  shared_vault_research_bonus_upgrade_desc:0 "The so-called "Sensetron" has saved thousands of man hours on our scientist team thanks to its cunning abilities. It's time to see if we can expand its utility following the Vault-Tec manual.\n\nAccording to basic protocol we can insert a simple holodisk into the drive and gain a gigabyte of RAM! This should do the trick."

  shared_vault_slot_research:0 "Strange Days"
  shared_vault_slot_research_desc:0 "With our resource issues figured out and our scientists on full focus we've reached an efficiency unseen in even the best projections from Vault-Tec. It seems our loveable science team has ushered in a new era of technological progress in a wasteland full of ignorants."

  shared_vault_the_geck:0 "The G.E.C.K."
  shared_vault_the_geck_desc:0 "Our Vault has exceeded even the highest expectations of survival rate in the barren wasteland, now it's time for our final purpose. We must exit our comfortable and cold steel walls to venture out and make the wasteland green and pristine with our mint condition G.E.C.K.!"

  shared_vault_post_geck_1:0 "Opening The Doors"
  shared_vault_post_geck_1_desc:0 "What lies behind those mighty portals into the earth? What differences do the other Vaults have in their construction? What's distinct about their inhabitants?\n\nOnly one way to find out!"

  shared_vault_post_geck_2:0 "Dwellers Of Vaults"
  shared_vault_post_geck_2_desc:0 "Our ongoing exploration of the Vaults, of their similarities and differences, has given us keen new insights into the the company that built them, the end of the world, and ourselves."

  shared_vault_post_geck_3:0 "The Truth About Vault-Tec"
  shared_vault_post_geck_3_desc:0 "Eleven-plus data points leads us to an unfortunate series of revelations about the company that sheltered our ancestors...."

  gen_vault.1.d:0 "It's not a very well kept secret that some of the vaults out there weren't exactly designed with their occupants' best interests in mind. While there were many control vaults, a number had more than just safety in mind. Some were downright horrifying, all in the name of science!"
  gen_vault.1.a:0 "Ours was mostly normal."
  gen_vault.1.b:0 "It got a little weird in there."
  gen_vault.1.c:0 "The Horrors..."

  gen_vault.2.t:0 "Reserve Your Space Today!"
  gen_vault.2.d:0 "Eventually the overseer had to make some hard calls about whether or not to open the vault door. The surface was still dangerous to be sure, but it was just as certain that there were people out there and those folks could potentially help us out or even join us! They also could kill us all!"

Some of them might have been, and actually did their job, but the rest were part of a great conspiracy. The prewar government and Vault-Tec designed most of the vaults as cruel and inhumane experiments to be conducted on the inhabitants. Whether they were manipulative social experiments or simply testing dangerous scientific breakthroughs on a captive audience most of the vaults we find are graveyards or dens of madness."

  VLS_OVERSEER_KNOX_NAME:0 "Overseer Knox"
  VLS_OVERSEER_KNOX_DESC:0 "Thomas Knox has a problem, though he'd never admit it out loud. It's the knocking. Faint at first, barely more than a tick against metal, but it never stops. Day or night, in his office or the empty halls—always just out of reach, always just behind him.\nVault 27 was always designed to fail—a labyrinth of scarcity, overcrowding, and tension wound so tight it should've snapped years ago. But it didn't. Overseers before him cracked under the strain, but Knox endures. He micromanages every calorie, counts every bunk, calculates every birth. Order over mercy. The numbers must add up.\n\nYet… the knocking persists. He's had maintenance crews tear apart walls, inspectors crawl through air ducts, and guards stationed at sealed bulkheads. Nothing. Just metal and shadows.\nSome say it's the pipes, others whisper about restless spirits or something else—something Vault-Tec never put in the official blueprints. Knox doesn't believe in ghosts. He believes in quotas, ration schedules, and population charts.\n\nBut when he's alone in his office, pen poised over another grim report, and the knocking starts up again—closer this time—he can't help but wonder: what if something is knocking back?"

  vls_crammed_vault:0 "Knock-Knock"
  vls_crammed_vault_desc:0 "It's not the tight corridors or the endless sea of faces that bother most folks in Vault 27. It's the sounds—the faint tapping, the rhythmic knocking. You hear it in the walls, in the air vents, even in the floor beneath your bunk. People used to joke about it being 'the Knocker’s beat,' but no one’s laughing now. When space is this tight, every knock feels like it’s for you."

  vls_ghost_division_focus:0 "The Ghost's Brigade"
  vls_ghost_division_focus_desc:0 "The Ghost Division—they don't just march, they knock. A strange superstition runs among them: they tap twice on their helmets before battle, twice on the door before entering a new room. Some say it’s for luck, others claim it's to appease 'Them'—whatever’s been knocking since the Vault first sealed. They bring back what the Vault needs, but stories of their hunts grow stranger every day. Supplies from hollow places. Weapons with whispers. And always... always the knocking."

  vls_biggest_little_vault:0 "The Knockers' Workshop"
  vls_biggest_little_vault_desc:0 "Vault-Tec left us tools—excavators, drills, machinery for building homes underground. But when the digging starts, so does the knocking. Harder, sharper, almost... irritated. Engineers joke about 'angering the Knockers' when they hit an unexpected steel bulkhead or hear echoes that shouldn’t bounce back. But the workshop hums on, and the Vault grows—up, down, sideways. Knock-knock, Vault-Tec."

  vls_chance_of_a_lifetime:0 "Knock Twice for Luck"
  vls_chance_of_a_lifetime_desc:0 "Vail's Reach has become an irresistible prize, and the Ghosts have drawn up plans to crack it open like an old steel drum. They say Tomas Knox told them to knock twice before they breach any gate or safehouse—always twice, never three times. Nobody asks why anymore. If they listen close enough, they’ll hear the answer on the wind."

  vls_settlers_from_below:0 "From Hollow Halls"
  vls_settlers_from_below_desc:0 "Generations of dwellers have dreamt of sunlight, fresh air, and homes that don't hum with recycled oxygen. Now, they have their chance. But as they settle above, some swear they still hear faint knocking in the earth below—like the Vault itself is calling them back, one hollow knock at a time."

  vls_no_more_food_stamps:0 "Knock-Knock Crops"
  vls_no_more_food_stamps_desc:0 "The hydroponics bays kept us alive, but barely. With proper greenhouses under the open sky, we'll finally have real food. Yet some settlers have started marking their fields with strange little cairns—piles of rocks, taps etched into wood. They say it keeps 'Them' away. Knox hasn’t said a word about it… but he hasn’t stopped them, either."

  vls_more_breathing_space:0 "More Breathing Space"
  vls_more_breathing_space_desc:0 "At its best times, Black Canyon is disorganized, dangerous hellhole. It's time to give the good people of Vault 27 the breathing space that they deserve!"

  vls_fresh_air:0 "Sky Above, Knocking Below"
  vls_fresh_air_desc:0 "For the first time, Overseer Knox awoke beneath open skies, sunlight washing over his face. And yet, even here, surrounded by fields and free air, he paused. Beneath the hum of cicadas and the rustle of grass, there it was: faint, but unmistakable—tap, tap, tap. Somewhere, the knocking continues."

  vls_ghosts_in_the_shell:0 "Marching to the Beat"
  vls_ghosts_in_the_shell_desc:0 "The Ghost Division doesn’t fight for honor, nor for survival—they fight because they’re driven. Something in their black helmets, in their hollow footsteps, speaks of inevitability. They move in eerie synchrony, their heavy boots falling with the same rhythm as the knocks Tomas hears in the walls. Whatever’s out there in the wastes… it’s marching in time with them."

  vls_open_vault_riches:0 "The Vault’s Last Knock"
  vls_open_vault_riches_desc:0 "When the Vault doors creaked open and the citizens rushed out, weighted pressure plates triggered one final trick. Hidden chambers snapped open, caches of tools, supplies, and forgotten luxuries laid bare. Overseer Knox sealed them shut again, quick and quiet. But something else came with the opening—something faint, something… knocking."

  vls_spacey_vault:0 "Open the Walls, Let the Knocks Out"
  vls_spacey_vault_desc:0 "No more crowded bunks. No more endless lines for air vents and food rations. The people of Vault 27 are free, under open skies and on open land. But some dwellers still glance back at the vault door, as though expecting something—or someone—to follow them out. And in the stillness of twilight, one question remains unanswered:\n‘Who was knocking all that time?’"

  vls_ghost_division:0 "The Ghost Brigade"
  vls_ghost_division_desc:0 "Once citizens, now legends in black power armor, the Ghost Division is Vault 27’s sword and shield. But their legend grows stranger with every sortie. They knock before entering ruins, knock before sealing airlocks, knock twice before they fire. Some say it’s ritual, others say it’s respect. But no one dares ask them why."
  vls_ghost_army:0 "The Knocking March"
  vls_ghost_army_desc:0 "When the Ghost Division moves, the world listens. The rhythm of their march carries far across the wastes, a sound like distant thunder—or hollow knocking on steel. They’ve stopped explaining themselves. They march, they knock, and they conquer."
  vls_full_vault:0 "Knocks in Every Corner"
  vls_full_vault_desc:0 "Even now, with more space and more air, some dwellers swear the knocking hasn’t stopped. They hear it in the new greenhouses, in the windmills, and in the spaces between. Whatever it was—or is—it’s still listening."
  vls_open_vault:0 "Open Vault, Open Knocks"

  vls_vault.1.d:0 "A rogue gang from the Claim Jumpers has poured across the border and is holding Vail's Reach hostage. Black Canyon is far too disorganized to mount an offensive of their own. However, our Ghosts know that area better than anyone and can easily save the town from these bandits. Should free the town and return it to Black Canyon, or should we keep the territory for ourselves?"

They followed hidden trading paths and quickly surrounded the city, massacring the invadors and saving all but a handful of townspeople from their oppressors. Vail's Reach was quick to accept Vault 27's control of the area, and the Black Canyon soldiers have refused to mount any sort of offensive against our superior Ghosts."

Black Canyon's \"negotitions\" lead to a two hour shootout, with both armies and most of the townsfolk dead. Now the Ghosts stand ready to mop up whoever is left and hold the city for themselves."

  vls_vault.4.d:0 "Black Canyon was more than eager to accept our offer of help. Black Canyon militias drew attention east while the Ghost Division swept in quietly from the west, massacring the oppressors and saving every last townsperson. Now the people of Narrow are also asking for Vault 27's support, essentially securing the whole region under our control."

  clk_vault.1.t:0 "The Ticking Vault"
  clk_vault.1.d:0 "It was a simple start. When the vault was sealed and the bombs fell, those inside were relieved to have been spared the devastation upon the world outside. The only oddity was the Overseer's insistence that the dwellers follow a tight schedule, dictating when they ate, slept, rested and worked. Gradually the schedule grew more and more comprehensive, indicating when it was time for each dweller to do nearly anything, whether it was getting a haircut or playing with their children. Those who questioned the need found themselves denied food and water, and in time the vault filled up with the ticking and chiming of hundreds of clocks. Generations later time is the ever-present companion and master of the dwellers in Vault 24, and there are no more questions of its importance. They track it, live according to it, and dread the day that it runs out for them, or for the world as a whole. That last fear leads to obsession festering within the quarters of the vault's brightest minds, and they have a single overarching question that needs answering; can Time ever march backwards as it does forwards?"
  clk_vault.1.a:0 "Time is a great healer"

  clk_vault.2.t:0 "Overseer: Tock"
  clk_vault.2.d:0 "The man who would become the Chief Timekeeper and Overseer of Vault 24 was once a scientist, excited to step out through the door and learn about the new world they'd been sheltered from so long. That dreamy wonder was shattered by a very real nightmare. What he found was an ashen desert, scattered and desperate survivors and monsters he could never have imagined. Along with the rest of his recon team Tock explored the region, logging everything he saw on his pip-boy. In his notes he detailed the hostile tribes that filled the lands in all directions, the deathclaws that tore apart his closest comrade, the radiation that still ticked away at his geiger counter. It was not all horror, there were moments of triumph and discovery as well. It was Tock and his compatriots who turned the tide and rescued those living in the ruins of Beaver City from a troop of marauding super mutants, earning the survivors' gratitude. It was Tock who discovered the strange ghoulish folks who time had seemingly forgotten and recorded them for vault posterity. It was enough that when the recon team returned to the Vault that Tock, who had become the de facto leader of the group, was treated as a conquering hero. In the days that came later, Tock ruminated on the terrible and broken world he'd beheld and recorded. When he was named the first Overwatch of the vault, his mind was still occupied by how badly time and radiation had ravaged the earth. Time was the greatest force of all, he thought to himself, it was something beyond what the vault had previously understood. It was all-powerful, and running out. The only way to save the world was to restore it."

  clk_vault.3.t:0 "The Road Ahead"
  clk_vault.3.d:0 "The battle for southwestern Utah ended after what felt like an eternity of blood and struggle, with the death of Salt-Upon-Wounds at the hands of Overwatch Tock. What the savage tribe had thought would be an easy victory over weak and fearful hole dwellers had become a grinding war for each dusty hill and broken building. In the later days of the conflict the Timekeepers began to return every dark deed visited upon them in spades, burning and ravaging the White Legs camps as they went. Shocked by the bitter determination and sheer brutality of their foes, the White Legs laid down their weapons and pleaded for mercy. A degree of it was granted to them, though the Timekeepers had been changed by their introduction to war. These tribes of violent and primitive people would not be allowed to threaten the sanctity of the Vault, and the inheritance of the world by such folk only strengthened their resolve to try and save the world. For the White Legs' part, they were shocked into submission by the power and violence of their foes, and soon found themselves worshipping the newest and strongest god of their pantheon: Time."

  clk_vault.4.t:0 "Friends in High Places"
  clk_vault.4.d:0 "They met underground in a half-collapsed bunker, both more comfortable in such environs. One for the shelter it provided from the blazing desert sun, the other for how it reminded them of home. When the White Legs were broken and the Timekeepers first looked upon the dusty lands of their new neighbours, the Sky Reavers, both groups felt that more violence was soon to come. Instead they met in peace, their leaders each curious about the others' motives and capabilities. Nearly a full day they spent speaking in that old steel cavern, each finding the other to be unlike what they expected. Kronos was more soft-spoken and calm, with a mind better suited for technology and devious thoughts than the vault dwellers would have believed a day before. In turn the Reavers were surprised to find Tock a manic and a harsh man, willing to do anything for his goals rather than a soft and wilting vault flower. They spoke of turf boundaries, technology exchanges and access to the ancient pre-war facilities that lay underneath the dust of 51. By the time the sun set, both leaders were pleased and Tock had already made plans to accompany the Reavers to their base for a week of further meetings and exchanges of information. In between discussions with Kronos, Tock spent his time poring through the old records and archives the Reavers had packed away in dusty corners and closets. Inside one old box were holotapes that the Overwatch of Vault 24 listened intently to on his pip-boy; recordings of transmissions from a station that once hung in the vastness of space before plummeting to earth. The dead voices on the tape spoke of experiments in the manipulation of light, of studies into the nature of space and the fourth dimension. By the time the last tape ejected into his hand, Tock knew what must come next."

  clk_vault.5.t:0 "Time to Wake Up"
  clk_vault.5.d:0 "Frustration had begun to rule the day in Vault 24. No matter their diligence, the Timekeepers' best minds had hit a theoretical wall, unable to progress any further in their research and experiments. They were confident that time travel, the last hope of this dead and dying world, was just out of their grasp and the so near but oh so far nature of the issue left the scientists nearly manic with desperation. It was Overwatch Tock who reminded them of how far they had come and restored their determination, playing for them the tapes and interview logs obtained from the Sleepers outpost at Bomb 002 and telling them to wait while he retrieved just what they needed. Only a couple months later Overwatch Tock stood at the head of a small army, the best that the Timekeepers and their new “client” tribes could muster. They camped in the conquered lands of Eagle Rock, the once bustling home of commerce and sailing airships now converted into a staging ground. It was a strange place to find such a force: integrated tribals, Vault-Tec security uniforms and hastily converted pre-war military equipment all assembled for the next, and hopefully last, great push. It was to hopefully be the site of Overseer Tock's greatest triumph, the gaining of the last piece of the fourth dimensional puzzle. For across the Colorado River lay a secret, the hidden base of The Sleepers and hope of the Timekeepers."

Once the machine was tested, the first expedition went out. Then, an hour past their designated return time they appeared again, burning. After they'd succumbed to their wounds, their exploration log data was recovered, stating what they'd seen.\n\nThe state of the world was hell on earth. Crackled and wicked tree carcasses littered the earth. The soil was sandlike and smelled like rust. Everywhere smelled like smoke, each expedition member reported how difficult it was to breath, like their chests were being piled with rocks. Above the ground tears through the air bellowed fire and dust. Hollowed out skyscapers stood blasted out and blazing. Nothing was familiar. Once they had gotten further out, the heat became unbearable, which made them decide to turn back. As they began back, they saw overhead an obsidian painted plane flying across the horizon, which is where the report ends."

A hundred scavengers assembled to loot every compartment and crevice on the site. Overflowing carts rattled in and out of the hidden places in Rock Springs for hours. Kronos and two other Reavers landed onto the grounds, said their goodbyes, and shook hands with Tock. Eventually we found what we'd be looking for, the Calculating Array. It was immediately hurried back to the vault, and installed into the newly finished machine. The array lit up, and the terminal to the side began its calculations. After the clicks and whirring finished, a message requesting action appeared. With approval granted, the machine creaked and roared to life, basking the room in a blue light. It was ready."

Tock has already held a meeting with Kronos, assuring that the land will be restored to us shortly. This is land fought for rightfully, to let it fall into the hands of thieves would jeopardize the army's morale. We don't want to keep our people waiting, it's too early to give up now."

Decades ago it had fallen out of its orbit for reasons unknown and fallen deep in the crack of the world, the Grand Canyon. It promised a wealth of technology and supplies for Vault 24’s great project to save mankind: high end computers, exotic alloys, rare sensors, precise electronics and heaps of fissile material.\n\nUpon notice from out scouts of its form bulging up from the rocky earth, Overseer Tock (against the recommendation of Timekeepers Oswald and Russell) had led the first foray. Perhaps we should not have been so surprised that the sturdy structure had been inhabited, and yet…\n\nClad in bizarre suits, the small force inside at first attempt to keep out the invaders of their domain with loudspeakers and plasma fire. But once we returned with a larger force, the caretakers of 002 saw that they were not merely warding off tribals, but indeed outnumbered by a considerable fighting force intent on taking the station from them. During the negotiations of surrender, they revealed to us that they belonged to a group referred to as the Sleepers. While the name means nothing to us, and we’ve certainly never heard of a Victor Presper, they are clearly quite the sophisticated bunch. This bunch is merely a small expedition of a larger group. Everything they could easily salvage and haul had already been sent back. They watched over what remained, studying the logs and keeping out petty scrappers.\n\nAfter many days of interrogation and investigation into their notes and supplies, we finally have a location for where all that they took went: Rock Springs."

While the lack of rifling makes them somewhat inaccurate, to say the least, the powder and ammo for these muskets are awfully cheap to supply on long trips.

  VSH_MAYOR_SHOWTIME_NAME: "Mayor Showtime"
  VSH_MAYOR_SHOWTIME_DESC: "Mayor Showtime, named for her penchant for saying "it's showtime" as a child, is the latest representative elected by the united communities of Safehaven to speak for the people. She has a shimmer in her eye, she believes that Safehaven can be a force for good not only for its people, but the wastes as a whole and she is always willing to negotiate with those who make it possible. It was her hand that kept the Great Stampede from crossing the river, and it was her hand that navigated into successfully plundering the treasures of Middlemark as of late-- but on the other hand, she was the one who let the Wardens in, something that doesn't sit right with many of the Mercs and Criminals that call Safehaven home.\n\nSure, she may be the one who keeps the peace-- or, at least, she tries to, anyway. But she is tired of Safehavenites being punching bags and is beginning to understand the more violent citizens calling for war. Even going so far as to arm some of the denizens more vulnerable to Merc chicanery, making sure a gun or two goes missing when it needs to-- and there sure are a lot of guns to keep track of in Safehaven..."

  VSH_MARY_MULLIGAN_DESC: "§CSierra Hotel is back, and we're bloodthirsty, bloodthirsty for those that did the Wardens harm. We vow to repay the kindness of Safehaven tenfold, but first, we have a new mission.§!\n\nAfter having won the newly revitalized community elections of Safehaven, Mary Mulligan and Sierra Hotel Company have been chosen by the citizens to lead them into a new future, taking a hold of the government. While many are excited for their favourite para-military organization to parade around the wasteland in the name of "justice" and "retribution" a small amount of the former mayoral office are afraid that this decision may not only doom those that call the 'haven home, but the Canadian Prairies as a whole.\n\nMary is eager to prove them wrong, in her own way at least..."

  ###safehaven loc - Advisor names and desc.

  VSH_SHOWTIME_ADV_DESC:0 "“§YYou know, I’m not entirely sure, but I think I’ve eaten my fair share of boots to decide what the uniforms should have.§!”\n\nMayor Showtime has been the secretary, all of the cabinet members, and janitor in her short political tenure in Safehaven, and now, after the previous office holder died of a cold, both Safehaven’s newest and longest-serving mayor; A position often vacated quickly in favor of signing up for the lucrative mercenary guilds that call Safehaven’s easily exploitable systems home.\n\nAfter growing up in this poverty, she has vowed to erase it from her nation, through her hands or another. This means that she’s decided to leave her old life of crime behind, for the foreseeable future. But then again, Vault 107 was meant to be filled with a bunch of smooth-talking backstabbers..."

  VSH_MARY_MULLIGAN_ADV_DESC:0 "§C“What do you mean, Mayor Showtime? Poisoning their water supply would be more than humane, uh... shit ok- I will look for an alternative.”§!\n\nAlthough not much more than a guild within Safehaven, Sierra Hotel’s own Mary Mulligan has been of great help to Mayor Showtime, teaching her professional techniques, tactics, and proper training procedures used by the Wardens of The White before their fall, almost singlehandedly turning Safehaven from a home away from the battlefield for mercs, to a nation with a defense.\n\nMayor Showtime has been grateful for Mary’s efforts, appointing her as a right-hand woman in all affairs, much to the disapproval of the many mercenaries that call the lands home away from the battlefield; Her rally for the unification of the many militia companies souring the relationship Showtime has with her people; nevertheless Mary’s work, in the Mayor's mind at least, is towards a better, safer, and most importantly richer Safehaven for her people whether Mary herself believes this is its own point of contention..."

  VSH_DON_SPANGLE_NAME:0 "G. Don Spangle"
  VSH_DON_SPANGLE_DESC:0 "§Y“Made man- what the hell is that shit? No... No, my name is Donald... Grandpa to you, though, kid.”§!\n\nAlthough once a great and powerful man, beloved by the many crime families formed after Safehaven’s founding in the vault, Don has abandoned that life, becoming more or less a grandfather to the orphans of the northern wastes, insisting they refer to him as such. By establishing many orphanages across Safehaven, pursuing the destruction of slavery operations, paying for expeditions to recover any lost children, and generally guiding the children to a better future with education as well as care, he has ensured their protection from the seedier parts of Safehaven as well as the rest of the northern frontier. For him, crime isn’t stealing, plundering, or any of that raider shit; it’s robbing kids of their childhood or, even worse yet, their lives.\n\nDon doesn't know much about these Warden people, but they kill the raiders and other scum looking to fuck with Safehaven and his kids. They also keep some of the “meaner” guilds from doing horrid things, so in Don’s book, they’re good as gold, especially since they enjoy visiting the orphanages and teaching some CQC and other things needed to survive in today's world to the kids. Though on some nights, when he’s drunk after the kids have been put to bed and he’s in one of his head offices, you can sit down with him, and he’ll tell you if these Wardens were around his daughter and her kid would still be around, that those scum would’ve been dead meat, although when sober, he refuses to elaborate or explain, whatever the case what happened on that day surely sent Grandpa Spangle on the righteous path of charity he now walks..."

  VSH_GULL_BRUN_NAME:0 "Gulliver Brunswick"
  VSH_GULL_BRUN_DESC:0 "§G“YEAH, WE FUCKIN RULE! MILITANT DOGS RULE! YEA- Wait, what? You know who we are?”§!\n\nOften small, ill-equipped, and sometimes surprisingly smart thanks to the many orphanages established in Safehaven, the militias that make up its powers are often full of old remnants of some or such other failed venture wishing to pass on their ideals to the youth, often entertaining whatever poor young person they can find leaving one of Don’s homes, promising riches, power or whatever they might want. This, as expected, does not fetch very many recruits, but some, such as the Militant Dogs, fetch even less than the average amount, being made up of, at the most, ten to twenty old men, becoming obscure and little more than a fan club around old bastards spouting fake tales of adventure to eachother and recounting stories. The Dogs differ from the usual militia, in the fact that they volunteer for Safehaven’s military, and since they were once a beloved clan, occult as it may have been, just having the name is likely to grant a high ranking position, just on the basis of their clan’s name wishing to be heard on the field every once and awhile for the memories it brings.\n\nGulliver Brunswick, the last remaining member of the MDS, had no idea this was the case when he signed on as the only recruit that the elderly men making up the leadership could find. As they passed away shortly after hiring him, he decided that his skills would be best used serving the greater good, to his surprise their popularity granting him a spot on high command, he now pursues bolstering Safehaven's military; Although he does not do this out of kindness only, he wishes to establish the Militant Dog's as a acclaimed militia once again, whether or not it means destroying nations in the process..."

The experiment was to place a bunch of white collar “scheming” criminal types all together and see how quickly they fell apart.\n\nThough there was initial shock, the Vault Dwellers quickly figured themselves out, forming their own systems and even beginning forays out into the Canadian blizzards. That sort of calculating wisery that had gotten them placed into Vault 107 came in handy time after time again when it came to wastelanders.\n\nEventually, the vault doors opened and did not shut again. So 107 became a safe haven, a beacon of light on a sunless frontier to travelers and highwaymen alike. Over time, communities formed around it in the shells of Old World towns, and they too bore Safehaven's banner."

It's a pretty nice place to be and everyone wants to control that piece, leading to historically hostile tendencies from the robotic workers.\n\nWe, just as much as the other fuckers staring at the glowing lights of the mall in the cold nights, want some of the prosperity within. With it quieting down recently, we've been raring to mount an expedition to visit, unfortunately, many of the companies here are too chicken to take the trip. Luckily enough, the spec ops forces of Sierra Hotel have volunteered to scope the area, and figure out what's going down inside. Even though rumors of their old enemies, the Miscounts, returning have them jumpy. It's been weeks since we've heard back from them though, Mary fears the worst may have befell her company members...

Supposedly, their old place got busted to Hell and back by some folks like the ones down in Montana.\n\nMary Mulligan's their shot-caller. They're far from the nicest people we've got in Safehaven, and some folks are even going so far as to call them "backhanded," or "duplicitous," but it hasn't gotten us in any trouble just yet.\n\nNevertheless, with their help, the once poor and weak volunteer only governmental system is on track to actually being a force worth supporting in Safehaven, rather than a glorified message system ran by second rate mercs."

This confusion served no purpose she decided, as the situation was already in hands not belonging to her: Sierra Hotel's namely.\n\nApparently they will be demanding the territories north of our rivers border for the return of their daughter- a sure way to set up a good line for attack should we go to war."

Climbing the shopping mall they viewed through the skylights a vast commercial area, with wall mounted screens presenting their A.I. leader, and cheap rip off Rob-Co securitrons wheeling about– A usual sight, until raiders adorned with store merch paraded into the social center, inadvertently destroying displays and parading with their weapons, cheering and chanting “Penny”.\n\nUpon further inspection, the leader of the expedition team, a veteran of the raider wars, recognized the gang as the Miscounts, but not before the many cameras watching the premises spotted the teams, and the gang cornered them, leaving them no choice but to hightail back to the Wardens in hiding, stupidly revealing their base to the Miscounts, Alpha Squad chose to run rather than fight, being the only squad to escape the doom that awaited the scouts.\n\nThis has weakened Sierra Hotel, leaving only a handful of original members to lead the company. Ms. Mulligan has not taken this well, becoming almost vengeful, and imploring Mayor Showtime to strike back quickly. Showtime tells her that a war with the 'mark isn't viable at this time due to their connections-- much to Mary’s displeasure; as she claims that their true enemy isn’t the Stampede, but instead lays across the river, in Calgary's superstore..."

These memories brought rage.\n\nExtensive preparation had gone into this operation, with thorough planning sessions eating into both Showtime and Mary’s schedules but its payoff would be more than worth it. Mary and her wardens would storm the mercenary's clubhouse, whether by speech or bullet. Once inside Showtime would enter and do the talking. One way or another the Mercenaries would sing her tune, the question was how? She had two ideas. She could butter them up, claim them as vital to the nation's security, and plead they sign onto the military as an elite defense force akin to the wardens or she could simply threaten them into doing things her way, using the wardens as leverage. Both had their merit, but it was a delicate situation and she could not afford to screw it up although the thought of humiliating herself once more left a bitter taste in her mouth..."

Instead of broken shacks and empty plates, we have proper houses and growing agriculture.\n\nSafehaven had become an actually civilized place, something akin to Brandon or Shady Sands except with its own charm. Who knew that within the frozen and rigid plains of Canada, a place as warm as this could come to exist? A nation full of do-good mercenaries focused on helping the people around them and fighting the bad guys. It had truly become a place worth fighting for, a haven for the weak away from the wicked.

The people could finally breathe easier with the Great Stampede no longer breathing down their neck.\n\nShowtime moved to the podium, ready to give her closing speech. “We have done what many considered to be impossible. We destroyed the giant of Alberta, setting their people free. We proved ourselves to the wasteland, we proved that the Safehaven model works. That it will continue to work for the foreseeable future. We shall continue to strengthen ourselves and protect each other from evil!” Showtime bellowed proudly, met with cheers from the audience. She beamed at the crowd, their enthusiasm proving contagious.\n\n”What about my husband!? Where was his protection!?” a voice called out from within the crowd. Showtime frowned, not exactly sure how to respond. A few other voices joined in. “You stand around giving medals to these soldiers when it was clearly the Wardens who won us this war! They’re the only people around here who get stuff done!”. The jeers and heckles continued to come in, eventually centralizing into a repeated ‘Let the Wardens rule!’. Showtime looked towards Mary who also seemed surprised by what was occurring. She stepped forward, addressing the audience.\n\n”The Wardens have been dedicated to supporting all of you. If it is truly the will of the people that we take control, I shall step up and assume the role of Mayor!” Mary said. Receiving the cheers of some within the crowd. “Danger lurks all around us and within our land. We have only managed to stop one threat. They smile at us now, but when our backs are turned, that is when they shall unsheathe the dagger. There must be no compromise, no debate, and no negotiation. We can only feel true peace when we have annihilated our enemies. If you trust me with this power, I shall not rest until it is done! Who’s with me?” Mary shouted towards the audience, to which she was met by..."

Quickly assembling a few other Wardens, she moved out to the center of Safehaven, where the dissidents were. They arrived within thirty minutes of the call. It was time to play bad cop.\n\n“They stand just across the river! At any moment they could strike and we just let them roam freely! How can this be safe?!” A young woman yelled out to a large crowd. Mary quickly stepped in, ready to shut this down. She made her way towards the woman, ready to arrest her.\n\n“Cease you’re protesting and come quietly, or else,” Mary said, towering over the young girl. “I do not believe this. I talk about the vile raiders across our borders. The Wardens' great enemy and you move to stop me? Have the Wardens gone soft!?” The young woman bellowed at Mary\n\nMary hesitated, a frown appearing on her face. Her words were not entirely untrue. The Miscounts were dirty sons of bitches, and their close proximity meant they could strike any time.\n\n“What is your name, girl?” Mary asked “Sophia. Safehaven is my home, I just want to see it safe. You, as a Warden, you understand right?” Sophia pleaded. Mary remained silent. Memories of a lifetime ago flooded in. She grabbed Sophia’s hand and raised it to the air.\n\n“Then, Sophia, let it be known! You are right. Danger lurks all around us, poised to strike at any moment. The Wardens stand by you and the people. We can not let this danger exist freely! Not when we hold the strength to take them down!” Mary shouted, addressing the crowd before her.\n\n“We shall strike, we shall fight. We will not stop until that scum has been wiped off the face of the earth! A capitalist AI and its raider stooges are no match for the Wardens. I promise you, that we shall destroy them!” Mary screamed at the crowd, feeling her adrenaline rush.\n\nRevenge was always a nice feeling, coupled with making her new home a safer place? Mary quite liked the idea of that. Showtime might have her doubts but Mary had full faith and confidence in her Wardens' ability. Middlemark had no idea what was coming. "

The Wardens had crushed the Miscounts and Penny. They were currently in the midst of rounding up each and every Miscount for execution. Her hand was wrapped around the Miscounts' throat, all she had to do was squeeze. The blood feud would finally be settled and yet, a small nagging feeling chewed at Mary’s brain, hesitation. It angered her beyond reasoning but she couldn't shake the feeling. It wasn't pity she felt, she hated the Miscounts. It was her love of the Wardens that was stopping her. Or maybe the way the people looked up to them. They were always paramilitary assholes in the eyes of the Cascadian people, but here? The good guys, fighting for the sake of those calling Safehaven home.\n\nSwitching around the roles, the Miscounts would execute every Warden in a heartbeat. Or would they? More and more she’s noticed some Miscounts brought in wearing Warden tags around their neck. Tags that matched the names and faces of those wearing them. Not trophies, but as tokens of a time past. The Wardens were the good guys, right? Killing them all, even some of our kin would devalue everything the Sierra Hotel has begun to stand for, but then didn’t the Wardens also fight for justice? It confused her to no end. Mercy or Justice... or maybe more succinctly, hollow revenge? Who knows, still, the choice was hers. "

She held Mary’s stare for a second before a smile appeared on her face.\n\nTurning to the crowd, still smiling, she asked ”It’s not exactly what I had in mind, but I've always been a woman of the people. If it’s truly your choice, I will resign and hand over all authority to Mary!”\n\n”So people of Safehaven, do you wish for the Wardens to lead?!” Showtime shouted.\n\n\The result was a resounding affirmative.\n\n”Then it is done. I ask you to welcome your new leader, Commander Mary Mulligan!” Showtime shouted to the crowd, receiving huge cheers, ushering Mary to the podium.\n\n”I thank you all dearly. I promise you this opportunity will not be squandered. I will do everything in my power to create a safer and more powerful Safehaven.

I am truly honored that you continue to place your trust in me. Safehaven has changed much over time, but let me be clear! This is only the beginning! We shall continue to grow and we shall continue to push forward! Safehaven shall never be defeated. With the Wardens at our side and our hearts within us, we shall prosper! Greatness awaits for Safehaven, we need only reach out and grab it!” Showtime rallied. The crowd erupted into cheers with even Mary cracking a rare smile under her helmet. She couldn't help but feel a little sore that the people didn’t trust her, but if she had to lose to somebody, and she hated losing, she’d choose Showtime in a heartbeat. The Wardens would always back her up, she owed her that much."

We have to unite the Wardens once more, to punish those who destroyed us and all who threaten the Wasteland,” Mulligan stated. “No.” Sylvia retorted bluntly. Mary was taken aback by how quickly she responded, she began to speak when Sylvia cut her off.\n\n”No, Stop. Listen to me. I know you were always an ardent supporter of the Wardens. Your patriotism knows no bounds. But just listen to me. The Wardens are done and finished. They died in Washington, we’re just limping along. What if, from their ashes, we could create something new?” Sylvia asked. Mary felt rage boiling within her, she bawled her fists and began breathing heavily, trying to calm her anger down. She felt a hand on her shoulder, and turned to see Showtime who nodded at her. “Let me ask you something, Mary.” Sylvia began.\n\n”Do you think the world is a better place with the Wardens in it?” She asked. The question hit Mary like a slap in the face. Lifetimes of memories flooded through her, ones of pain, happiness, regret, pride, life, and death. The Wardens had been everything Mary knew, all she had ever been. She had wanted to make the world safe, no matter the cost. She felt tears begin to well up and her emotions bombarded her entire brain, something that had become foreign to her in the years leading to the fall of Seattle, and its aftermath. What would it be? She looked towards Showtime, desperate for some piece of advice that would fix her quickly cracking brain. Showtime met her gaze, a serious expression on her face. "I can’t help you with this Mary. This is between you and your conscience, No matter what you choose, the people of Safehaven will support you." Tears streamed down Mary’s face. She had made up her mind. "

Nobody can make the hard choices anymore, leaving me to pick up the slack for them.” He rambled, Mary absentmindedly agreeing.\n\n”It’s no matter now. With our groups reunited, we’ll be able to bring the fight back to anyone who’d even think of threatening us. I’m itching to kill every single one of those Washington boys who kicked us out. Every last one of them.” William said darkly. “Of course, but we’d first have to acquire the manpower to take them on, we lack sufficient strength to threaten them” Mary stated. “That’s fine, we’ll just have to conscript some of our nation's people, they won’t do well out there but all they need to do is divert fire so the Wardens can deal the damage. They won’t like it, but like I said, you need to be able to make the hard decisions as a Warden. “Of course Commander” Mary said, feeling a little uncomfortable with how William was acting. Of course, she wanted revenge and to restore the Wardens, but he seemed to take things a little too far. Could she really work with someone like him?"

Hear me, for I bring us our next step in solidifying our position within the Wasteland." She paused for dramatic effect, letting the silence build up her people’s curiosity.\n\n”Allow me to show you this!” Showtime shouted, pointing towards a blank screen that quickly lit up and displayed a giant document. “The Safehaven Mercenary Companies!” Showtime called out to the audience. “By sending out our men and arms to other like-minded democratic nations, we can help make the world a better place and continue to grow our nation. People like yourselves, with guns and hope within your hearts shall be the pride of our nation.” Showtime smiled, prideful of the assembly of people who supported her plans.

Their equipment was maintained to the highest degree. They were perfect, and then some in the eyes of Mayor Showtime. It brought hope to her heart.

She adjusted a necklace that rested around her neck, making it look as neat as possible. She was planning to address the nation very shortly and as such, she had to make her image as presentable as possible. Rain pelted hard against the room’s window, bringing a soothing sound to Showtime’s office. She began to adjust one of her diamond earrings as she moved towards the window, absentmindedly thinking about her speech. She stared out the window, watching as the rain fell down within Safehaven. Not a lot of people were out, most seeking shelter indoors. Except one, a young child who sat just barely undercover, an upside-down hat in front of her. It had no coins.\n\nShowtime immediately felt sick, her traumatic past rushing to her mind. She tried to shake the thoughts away, closing the blinds to block the child out of view but it didn’t work. The image remained in her brain, except the child was her. She looked down at her hands, her fingers carrying exquisite rings. She rushed to pull them off, throwing them on the floor. She tore the necklace off her neck, the pearls breaking and spreading on the floor.

But they all had agreed they deserved it after going so long without a proper break.\n\nMary had excused herself from the conversation, eager to fill up her glass yet again. Swaying slightly as she made her way towards the drink table, she looked at her discarded helmet which she had removed previously. She looked at its cracked lenses, lost in thought. Her expression beamed right back at her. Mary would never admit this to anyone, sometimes not even herself, but she doubted herself often. When she had made her decision to cut ties with the Wardens of Seattle and start something new, seriously wondered if she had made the right decision or if she had simply just become a traitor, somebody who needed to be put down before they could put people in danger. It still nagged at her from time to time, her inner criticisms and insecurities taunting her as she continued to push forward. But when she looked at Safehaven and when she looked at Showtime and Mary, it all seemed to be worth it.

Showtime’s smile dropped, her face immediately looking towards Mary. “Yes, I have. Plenty of them” Mary said. Showtime cringed, praying to god that Mary would show more tact.

Curious at the dangerous tales the scary and muscular woman had been involved in.\n“What’s the scariest thing you’ve killed?” Another child asked. “A Super Mutant behemoth. A huge monster. I had only...” Showtime watched in awe as Mary immediately went into the extremely gory details of her team killing monsters. There was a part of her that wanted to step in, but she couldn't find the heart to ruin the story that the children were so invested in.

You are a Warden, and a Warden only cares for one thing. Their mission. To step on the weak around them and to attack the strong who surround them. We shall never give up. We shall never yield!” She cried to the soldiers. They cried back to her, all of them shooting their arms up into the air. “For the Wardens of the White!” Mary screamed.

Understand me?” Showtime said sternly. The room was dead silent, the mercenaries not daring to say a word. “This isn’t your playground anymore, it’s a home. If you want to be a part of that home, I strongly suggest you do your fucking part for once. If that's not good enough for you then you can leave. But understand me if you plan to stay around and continue to annoy me. I’ll let Mary handle you, she’s a lot less friendly than me.” Showtime said, pointing to the powerful presence that stood behind her.\n\n”So, what’s it going to be?” Showtime asked.\n\nThe mercenaries exchanged worried glances before one stood up.\n\n”You think we give a fuck what you say? You don’t rule shit here, we’re the ones in charge.” The mercenary said, getting in Showtime's face. Her face twisted into disgust as she smelled his breath, she turned towards Mary and nodded slightly. The mercenary barely had a chance to notice before Mary’s fist connected with his jaw, knocking him straight to the ground unconscious. Showtime grabbed Mary’s gun and fired directly into his head much to the surprise of the room. The dead merc jittered slightly and fell still, blood oozing out of his head.\n\n”I’ll ask again,” Showtime said, addressing the room, blood splattered upon her face.\n\n“What’s it going to be?”"

Nobody had been killed when the Wardens demanded entry, but a firefight had been very close to breaking out.\n\n”Don’t worry, I haven't come to harm you, I simply came to offer you a deal” Showtime stated calmly. The mercenaries looked around, not quite sure how to feel.\n\n”I’m building a new Safehaven, a place for all. I want you to be a part of it, but it can’t remain the way it is now. It has to be a partnership, we have to work together to support these people. I need your support, your combat prowess. We need you in Safehaven as citizens, not mercenaries.” Showtime pleaded. The mercenaries exchanged glances, not quite convinced. Showtime started to get nervous, wondering if she would indeed have to bring the hammer down on them until, out of nowhere, Mary began to plead with them.\n\n”I was like you once. Looking for nothing but the thrill of combat, stepping on those I believed smaller than me. You have to understand that the people here in Safehaven want to get by, just like you and me and any person in this wasteland. We’re creating something new here, something bold and different. You can help us and be a part of that. You don’t need to fight with us anymore, we can work together to support these people and yourselves. Safehaven can still be your Safehaven, we just need you to leave room for everyone else. Please, nobody needs to die today” Mary nearly begged.\n\nThe mercenaries looked around at each other before one of them, their leader, stood up. “We accept your proposition”.\n\nAll parties breathed easier after that. Later on that day, Showtime would ask Mary why she spoke so passionately, still shocked at seeing her plead with somebody.\n\n”I don’t know what overcame me. I guess I just really care about this place.” She said softly"

  vsh_vault.33.d:0 "She quickly rushed out of her office, rushing to the planned filming room. The crew all looked up at her in confusion as she barged in, stopping in their tracks and simply staring at her. “Start rolling!” Showtime ordered. “Ummm, Mayor this isn’t the time we agreed on, we’re not ready to begin”A crew member stated. “I said, start rolling!” Showtime ordered loudly. The crew rushed to begin, getting the equipment ready. Showtime prepared herself. The crew signaled that it was time to start. “Safehaven. I’ve come to you today to say one thing... I’m-... I am... sorry. Seeing how far we could grow by using the Safehaven Mercenary Companies, I lost sight of the people and fell into greed. I thought that I was improving life for everyone within the nation- when, in reality, it was clearly only the elites and myself I catered to. This is wrong, so so so wrong. I am so angry at myself for losing myself, for losing sight of you, for becoming what I had once fought against. I will abide by it no longer, from now on I promise you, I will serve nothing but the people. I will make sure that equity is achieved. So that nobody will ever go hungry again. So that we will simply not survive, but thrive. For all those I've hurt, I'm so sorry. Please let me fix my mistakes. I owe you that much”"

  vsh_vault.34.d:0 "“WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING?!” A slighlty humored, but mainly furious Mayor Showtime screamed at Mary. The two of them were in Showtime’s office late in the night. Showtime was just leaving the place when Mary barged in with a child in her hands.\n\n"I didn't expect them to say no! What kind of family would ever refuse the ransom to their own child!" Mary yelled back, still slightly dumbfounded that her plan hadn't worked. “Well, they did! This means now we have the daughter of our enemies, they know we took her which means they’ll be coming for us any day now! Don’t even get me started about where we’re gonna put her!” Showtime said, pointing at Joy. “I’m far too busy to take care of a kid! Can you take care of them, Mary?!” Showtime asked. Mary opened her mouth, but no words came out. She fell silent. "I didn’t think so, Mary! We’re gonna have to drop her off at one of the orphanages or something. We are fucked, Mary. Utterly fucked. Get out of here, I need to figure something out." Mary did not need to be told twice, hurriedly leaving the room awkwardly holding the baby against her chest, a sigh and a giggle to be heard from Showtime as she watched the scene. She reprimanded herself internally, what had she been thinking? She shook her head, staving off those thoughts. She couldn't waste her time regretting her actions, she’d have to come up with a plan. Maybe she could still salvage this. Besides, the kid was kind of cute. "
