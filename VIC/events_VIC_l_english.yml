The ragtag team sent out to save him was made up of Vulpes Inculta's biggest fan, a man wearing a duck mask who constantly repeats his name, a Mexican bear enthusiast and our secret weapon: a Brazilian. Yet, they brought him home safely at last. His return is being celebrated by a parade yet one thing is clear: now that he's back on land, his service for law and order has begun again."

  nf_vic_april.1.t:0 "Kong Isle's Discovery"
  nf_vic_april.1.d:0 "Far, far away on a remote Pacific island lived the Kong family and their many animal buddies, undistrubed by all of human civilization. When colonization of the Pacific continued into the 1800s, merchants and explorers occasionally stumbled upon the island, but were hurried off back to their boats as soon as they arrived by the hostile wildlife. As a result, the land was left unclaimed and uninhabited for some time until the American government sponsored efforts in the middle of the 21st century to take control of many such documented islands in an effort to scrape the bottom of the barrel of candidates for remote bases or stagehouses given the fears of eventual Nuclear Armageddon. It was only once they ventured further that they discovered us. \n\nEver the charmer, Funky Kong was sent to stop the soldiers from resorting to violence against what they did not understand, and asked they report to the government and arrange a peace. \n\nAs one might expect, when the expedition returned and told stories of humanoid crocodiles and unaging apes having rap battles, the only thing the military responded with was an admission for the men to nearby psychiatric hospitals. However, this changed once individuals with ties to a certain secretive pre-war organisation of American government officials caught wind of their stories. \n\nAnd so it was that when the Americans returned a year later for negotiations, it was not in green helmets and camoflauge, but in steel-grey power armour. Fortunately, the crocodilian Kremling Krew, Donkey Kong's mortal enemies, provided them just the subjects they were seeking for their experiments, and so a symbiotic relationship was brokered. The D.K. crew and their animal friends would keep most of their autonomy--including, and Diddy's insistence, their glorious banana piles--provided they use their geographical knowledge to assist the Enclave in capturing Kremlings, permit the construction of a long-term barracks and dock for the American military near the shoreline, and pay taxes to the American government (after much debate, payment in the form of coconut shells was reluctantly accepted). In exchange, on top of helping fight the Kremlings and maintain the island's secrecy, the United States would..."

  nf_vic_april.2.d:0 "Though most of the Kongs found the taxes reasonable, and a fair trade for the perks of the arrangement, Cranky Kong was angered by the prospect of working with the Americans, but eventually the other Kongs talked him into it. And so, for a time the agreement proceeded. Until one day, suddenly, it all went wrong. \n\nArmy vessals came and went from Kong Isle regularly, but as soon as the Kongs instead saw elderly men and women in formal attire arrive, they knew something had gone awry. The D.K. crew were then shocked to find out that the men and women were from the Internal Revenue Service, and had come to investigate Cranky Kong for suspicicions of tax fraud. Cranky responded incredulously, but eventually during their search a secret stash of coconut shells owed to the government was uncovered within his home. When the other Kongs asked why he would do such a thing, Cranky revealed that he'd stolen anti-statist political literature from a cabinet in one of the Army's ships, and proceeded to ramble on about property rights and taxation as theft and all the ways the agreement with the United States stood in clear violation of the non-aggression principle. \n\nAs angry as they were with Cranky, though, when the auditors left to tell the army to conduct an arrest of Cranky Kong to take him to North America for a federal trial, the D.K. crew knew they had to protect their family above all else. And so it was that at sunset, right before the Army was set to arrest Cranky Kong, the D.K. crew and their animal companions sprung from under the cover of foilage and attacked the soldiers. Using the army's training against them, they routed the soldiers, escape to a ship ready nearby with their hoards of bananas on board, and sailed away from the isle to escape retaliation from the military, but not before..."

Instead, though, they found many abandoned homes and foreign, vile creatures. Eventually through records they uncovered, they learned of the nuclear apocalypse that had followed shortly after their escape to the sea. Though eventually they encountered human settlements on the island, many fled when confronted with not only the indigenous, mutated wildlife but also that which the Kongs brought with them. And so it was that over two centuries the Kongs settled more and more of the land, adapting to the more mountainous terrain and offering the remaining humans protection under Kongo Bongo. Donkey Kong's family disagreed on where the apes should focus most of their efforts on, but Donkey Kong ultimately favored..."

  nf_vic_april.4.d:0 "It was a dark and stormy night on the island. Diddy Kong was given the coveted task of watching the banana hoard, a job which normally entailed scaring off animals and the like. Things seemed to be going smoothly until he heard noises all around him, then voices whispering through the rain.\n\nSuddenly, something dove at him from behind his back, and once pinned down after a brief scuffle, he looked up to face his adversaries. \n\nIt was none other than King K. Rool and the Kremlings!\n\nThe distinct green which once characterize K. Rool and his minions had faded to a dull, dirty shade, and the King's snout appeared deformed. There was no telling how the Kremlings managed to survive, much less track their mortal enemies down, but they seemed to have become irradiated, ghoulfiied.\n\nDiddy, of course, found this hysterical. So hysterical that he kept uncontrollably laughing at their appearances even after they stuffed him in a barrel and ran off with the hoard. \n\nBy the time news reached Donkey Kong and he arrived at the cave, there was nothing left of the hoard. After freeing Diddy from this trap, he listened in anger and disbelief as Diddy told the story, exclaiming that the Kremlings would pay for all that they did."
