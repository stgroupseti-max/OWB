  CYC_DOYLE_NAME:0 "Doyle Owens"
  CYC_DOYLE_DESC:0 "The Nevada wasteland is a place of destiny, where even the slimmest little change can deter survival or early death, and the same problems meet with different solutions. The homeplains of the Buckaroos, as they call themselves, don't yield anything else, just yellowish sick grass and the only thing that reaps here is the wind. Large distances between settlements and between them are nothing else, just hostile wildlife and barren dunes. In a place like this, tools of transport are essential. These are the problems the Doyle boys faces, the same that the Khans ancestors or the Eighties face even.\n\nBut where the others choose the way of raiding, the Buckaroos follow the road of herding. Owens could have been the next Thunderbird, as he found and fixed his motorbike the same, and the plains could fear the name of the Black Prince. Instead, Owens became Owens and made a living where no one could survive."
