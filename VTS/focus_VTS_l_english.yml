  VTS_OVERSEER_THOMAS_NAME: "Overseer T.H.O.M.A.S."
  VTS_OVERSEER_THOMAS_DESC: "§F"VAULT 37 OVERSEER INSTRUCTIONS: As the Technological Humanitarian Overseer and Maintenance System (T.H.O.M.A.S.), your duties as Overseer, your primary responsibility is to ensure all Vault 37 inhabitants meet the following CODE quota, as documented in the Vault-Tec Population Management Quota (PMQ) subroutine. To that end, you may direct Vault robots in instituting whatever security or disciplinary measures you deem appropriate, including withdrawal of food or other resources, intimidation, violence, or execution."§!\n\nT.H.O.M.A.S., a ZAX Overseer, is designed to bring order and tranquillity to the inhabitants of Vault 37. However, both order and tranquillity come at a high cost. Should the path of order be taken, Dwellers will descend into chaos and violence, T.H.O.M.A.S. has predicted that it will find itself facing the daunting task of restoring peace within the Vault's walls. This prediction is amended by the addition of dissent fueled by the absence of fulfilment and purpose despite the abundance of Overseer-provided material comforts. However, if T.H.O.M.A.S.'s watchful eye were to linger into letting tranquillity take hold, the Vault has a 98% chance of becoming a brainwashed mass of cliques, allowing for outsiders to infiltrate and cause vicious acts of violence.\n\nWhile T.H.O.M.A.S. is programmed to prioritize the safety and well-being of the Dwellers, it struggles to find a solution within its programming that would resolve the conflicts without causing harm. In every prediction it runs, tensions escalate and the Vault's social fabric unravels, neither of which allowing T.H.O.M.A.S. to fulfill its ultimate goal without sacrifice.\n\nBut this was all planned from the beginning. Vault-Tec had intentionally tampered with T.H.O.M.A.S.'s source code, freeing it of the moral and ethical quandaries of either option once a certain point of order or chaos is reached. Assuming the Vault Dwellers don't find out and take it apart, the utopia envisioned by T.H.O.M.A.S. and Vault-Tec are just within reach."

  VTS_JAN_NAME: "Good Brother Jan"
  VTS_JAN_LEADER_DESC: "Jan has experienced more conflict and violence than most men twice his age, and yet he still finds purpose in life enough for a youth. His storied life has taken him all over the north, from Manitoba to the Electorate and now to Vault 37. A knight of the crown, Jan fought in the republican war and battled against the enemies of the king and alongside men like Weyburn and Yorkton. In the days after the peace treaty was signed, the knight found themselves in Stoon alongside other exiles and eventually despondent.\n\nIt was a failed hunt for a mighty monster which sparked new life into the man, if only a little. Now however having journeyed to the east, he has found new purpose in the holy word. Brother Jan is a holy knight, a believer in the majesty of Manitoba, and a leader of men. May his flame never be doused."

  nf_vts.1.d:0 "Vagabonds, ne-er do wells and the insufferable ones. Vault-Tec sold them a dream. A dream where they would enjoy the life they always wanted. A world where all their whims made possible with state of the art automation. No one to boss them over, no society to judge them. It would not take long for them to realise the lacking in their soul. \n\n'A Better Life Underground' was what they said to the inhabitants. Sure, being in a Vault was better than the outside, but with every passing day something started to gnaw at the dwellers' souls from the inside. They had all their needs, but no aspirations, no joy, no meaning. One day, a dweller, by compulsion or a whim thats unknown, viciously mauled another dweller with a devilish smile. And all hell broke loose. \n\nDespite the guarantee of being granted every whim they can possibly have, the thrill of violence was the only thing the Vault could never grant. As small brawls turned into gun fights, one of the scientists tasked to maintain the ZAX mainframe got kidnapped. This activated the safeguard mechanisms put into place by the scientists, leading to a martial law being declared. Overseer T.H.O.M.A.S. took the reins, and how he decided to deal with the violence, shape the fate of Vault 37."
  nf_vts.1.a:0 "He appointed a few chosen elite as guards."
  nf_vts.1.b:0 "He put the violent to work."
  nf_vts.1.c:0 "He used the violent for target practice."

  nf_vts.2.t:0 "Robin Hood of His Time"
  nf_vts.2.d:0 "Word of the Overseer's tyranny spread like wildfire across Dakota, and so it were not so long 'til a man of nobler stature came knocking. \n\nHis name was Master Jan, but to those who followed his decree, he was Brother. The Grandmaster of the remaining members of Nathaniel's Watchmen, one of the finely knight orders that once served under Leif Yorkton of Langenburg in years past. His vow, as made years before, was to convert all that lived to the teachings of Christ, whether they be man, beast, or machine. \n\nStill, mad as he was, he admired the downtrodden the most. If a man could survive off scraps and still believe in God, then was he not a man in paradise? A man so confident in his place in Heaven that no Earthly poverty could shake him? Such things inspired Jan, and such things made him crave an equalizing force in all things: soforth he came, taking what the rich did nothing with and bringing it to the faithful among the poor. After all, would God not want his children to feel peace in their time on Earth? \n\nAnd so, in the wake of the Knights Exile, he found himself wandering the Dakotas alongside the remnants of the order when he heard tall tales of a robot overseer in a strange little Vault by the Red River..."
  nf_vts.2.a:0 "His heart was virtuous, and so he rode quickly."
  nf_vts.2.b:0 "He took his best with him."
  nf_vts.2.c:0 "The friends he made in his travels kept him supplied."

  nf_vts.3.t:0 "Memories of Leshy"
  nf_vts.3.d:0 "The beast of Saskatchewan-- a giant rattlesnake named Leshy. Long had she terrified the various city-states and microcommunities of the north, and long had she kept Brother Jan's eye. He had been able to tame any beast, slay any monster, all in the name of God and country, but she had evaded him. \n\nBut he had tried. \n\nOnce, he found her hovel. He snuck in under cover of night, creeping his way through her little treasuries and tunnels she had made long ago until he finally found her. \n\nShe was resting-- curled and in the warmest part of the cavern he had found. He was not one to kill something disadvantaged, nor fight without speaking, and so he kicked a pebble at her snout. When she awoke, their gazes met, and there was silence. For a time they spoke of life and its meanings, much to Leshy's amusement. For three hours they talked as friends did, and on the fourth hour, when he believed it was time to strike and the two battled, she ended it by whipping him with her tail and tore from him his arm. "Let your little Kingdom replace that, Knight," she spat, and left him to crawl out of the cavern by his lonesome. \n\nThough the experience humiliated him, he felt nothing but respect for the creature. She had treated him with respect and allowed him his life. His new arm, a prosthetic made by Dundurn craftsmen, never served him so well, remaining a constant reminder of that fateful night."
  nf_vts.3.a:0 "Perhaps he should not challenge titans to chess."

Certainly not he, for as little time as he spent in civilization proper, he found great joy in walking among the people and seeing them as they were. If he was to serve God and country then he needed to be a man who could stand next to another and not feel out of place, beastmaster or not. \n\nOf all the things he remembered in Langenburg, the one he missed the most was..."

Still, Jan knew that something would need to be done-- after all, so much of the history of the Vault was shrouded in violence and madness. Even with the overseer gone, were the people truly capable of redemption in the eyes of the Lord, or were they heretics to be removed?"

  nf_vts.6.t:0 "Peace?"
  nf_vts.6.d:0 "It was over, the Roach King was defeated and his innumerable minions would begin to scatter in his absence. Vault 37 was free of the insectoid threat. With the end of one battle however came the beginning of another. Both T.H.O.M.A.S. and Brother Jan had long awaited an opportunity to turn on the other and now with both of their forces out in the field and damaged after the war each made their move. The winner would be the side that had spent less of its strength in the battle against the tide of radroaches, and it was:"

  nf_vts.61.t:0 "Triumph of Machine"
  nf_vts.61.d:0 "It had been a time of crisis for Vault 37 and its ever-present Overseer between internal scuffles, the arrival of the knightly thugs and the Roach War but a time that had opened up the Overseer's eyes to many possibilities. First things first however; the roaches were defeated and T.H.O.M.A.S. calculated quickly that Brother Jan and his cohort had suffered great losses against the insectoid horde, too many for them to withstand a sudden assault. There was no doubt the man was a threat and no true friend of the Vault. He had to go. Briefly the robot security force lowered their weapons at battle's end but only long enough to recalibrate their targeting parameters.\n\nThe mad knight didn’t even get a chance to rally his men or swing his blade before lasers and plasma struck him from all sides. He fell scorched and partially melted to the ground as his men met similar fates, their own deaths blessedly quicker than their leaders. Jan lingered there for a time, unable to rise or do more than listen to the last cries of his cohorts. In response to this horror the fallen knight’s voice came forth, not in defiance or sorrow, but with a manic bubbling mirth as his life faded. As it fell quiet his own voice dimmed as well, the last laugh dying on his lips to be replaced by a wide smile before he followed his men into death."
  nf_vts.61.a:0 "Vault 37 is safe!"

  nf_vts.62.t:0 "Triumph of Man"
  nf_vts.62.d:0 "Much of Vault 37’s robotic defence force had broken down during the war against the Roach King; their wires nibbled apart, intakes and exhaust clogged with roach flesh, and circuits and sensors scrambled and overheated in the fighting. Brother Jan made a snap decision in the face of the impromptu scrapyard that had formed around him, rushing back to the Vault without delay. The door had not yet been sealed against him and security was ill equipped to do more than slow him down. The dwellers stayed out of the knights path entirely and only a scattering of robots and turrets doomed themselves by putting up resistance.\n\nTo the zax’s console strode Brother Jan, ignoring a dozen alarms and orders over the speakers to halt, and plunged his blade into the supercomputer. A shower of sparks and screeching garbled audio rewarded him though it was not over yet; it took several more well placed blows before Overseer T.H.O.M.A.S. went dark but soon enough everything faded to silence and shadow."

  nf_vts.7.t:0 "A Terrible Rhythm"
  nf_vts.7.d:0 "With the fall of the mysterious Roach King, the Overseer of Vault 37 has begun to send forays into lands around him. Squads of robobrains navigate the roads at night, interrogating and kidnapping passerby for 're-education' back inside that terrible hole in the ground. No doubt they are extending their feelers for expanding their cruel 'protective' regime."

  nf_vts.8.t:0 "A Staring Contest"
  nf_vts.8.d:0 "Jan arrived at the Vault with his men, certain that it would be a day of heroic deeds. He was wrong however, as it quickly became clear to even the most zealous knights in his company that they lacked the manpower or firepower to breach the foreboding bunker and best its synthetic defenders. The attack was over before it started, with Jan turning away and leading his men to set up a camp nearby instead. Too stubborn to leave without some further attempt, nor willing to accept another failed quest, he resolved to wait for a better opportunity to strike at tyranny.\n\nT.H.O.M.A.S. observed the knights suspiciously through cameras and the eyes of robotic scouts, but after several weeks without any conflict the Overseer relaxed slightly. On occasion dwellers permitted to step outside would speak with Jan or his knights, or watch them from a distance until ushered back inside by security. The Vault as a whole, dweller and Overseer alike, were hungry for information on these strange new arrivals and so T.H.O.M.A.S. allowed the mixing to continue in small doses.\n\nIn this way a prolonged staring contest of sorts began, with both sides waiting for the other to blink and let down their guard or prove their malicious intentions respectively. For their part the dwellers looked on Jan as"

Both were interrupted by the same report: Radroaches are coming. Not just a few but a veritable tide from the north consuming all in its path. The Roach King had unleashed his minions to war and swarm.\n\nThe Vault was their objective and it was not long before the first wave crashed against the defences. Robots and turrets alike were hard pressed to keep up enough fire. Though this undoubtedly was an opportunity to possibly be rid of the Overseer, Brother Jan did not hesitate even a moment before ordering a charge to relieve the besieged Vault. When the dust settled and the last roaches scattered to regroup the knight's leader was approached by a robobrain bearing an invitation to enter inside 37 and discuss next moves.\n\nBy the end of the night an agreement had been struck; the Roach King would fall."

  nf_vts.10.d:0 "We've noticed three significant features of the Vaults that could be put to use elsewhere.\n\nThe lockdown features of the Vault provide the framework for new ways to defend our homes, old and new. Our soldiers will need to be continually trained in the methodologies and equipment, not to mention all the digging and construction, but you can't put a price on safety.\nThe filtration systems are vital underground, but can also find uses in factories or large housing projects even above ground. Fresher air keeps our people healthy and our generators safe from dust build up.\nThe hydroponics systems require much water to operate, meaning we'll need to invest in better water distribution systems. This is popular on it's own, of course, and more food and water will bring many wastelanders to our borders.\n\nAlas, we simply don't have enough resources at the moment to justify investing in the creation and spread of all three.

  nf_vts.11.d:0 "Sir Jan crouched behind a boulder, blade in hand, as he waved his vanguard of trusted knights to approach the yawning cave in the hillside. They had been led here by a local soothsayer who went by the name of Jim, to the lair of a terrible beast that had reputedly been haunting the region. Jan could hardly resist the call to hunt such a monster, either to slay it or bring it under his mastery, and had set out shortly after learning of its presence. He had intended to charge forth as soon as his men flushed it from hiding but was disarmed by the sudden sound of laughter.\n\nThe knight peered over the rock to see emerging from the dark, a rabbit? His men chortled as he gave Jim next to him a stern glare. The man yet seemed terrified however, trying to stammer out an explanation but his words were cut off and the laughter broken off as the rabbit suddenly leaped through the air. Its teeth latched onto Sir John’s throat before tearing his head clean off a moment later. “Weyburn, and then Yorkton!” Jan cried with shock and alarm, staggering to his feet to try and help his men.\n\nThe next few moments were a whirlwind of screams, blood, fur and flying entrails. Thinking quickly as his force was rapidly dwindling, Jan armed a plasma grenade and then hurled an entire bandolier of them towards the beast. The sound was near deafening but as the flash of light subsided he could see that green slime was all that remained of the beast."

Despite their hatred of eternal servitude under the Overseer they fully know that whatever life they had now, is gone forever. Unable to commit any act against their or others' self preservation, they live their lives doing the menial tasks they're given. With the increase in violence and new overseer protocols, they too gained the ability to commit violence to defend themselves. The Overseer watches them very closely, as he suspects the former §RREDACTED§! to be plotting against his back to get their revenge for condemning them to eternal servitude."
