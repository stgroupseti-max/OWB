  ##Localization by Team FlowerPower
  ##The localization team for this tree was wild. At first, it was just me-- Violet-- and then when we realized it could use a little more oomph, Lusa and Aider came to back me up with several lovely flavor events. :heart: Some foci were rewritten by them, as well!
  ##Whilst originally Colonel was going to Old Country, we had the idea for the Wardens of the White (who were previously featured as an entirely different faction prior to 4.0) to serve as a supplement to Old Country. I admit I-- Violet-- got quite carried away with some crazy stuff, but I hope if you're reading this that you enjoyed it! :D

  nf_toc.1.t:0 "The Vault 100 Experiment"
  nf_toc.1.d:0 "Constructed beneath the city of Spokane, Vault 100 was one of the largest vaults created by Vault-Tec, designed to house proficient ex-military personnel and some of the best pre-war scientists that the world had to offer-- a time capsule of experience and knowledge for the wasteland to make use of.\n\nWhile the science and medical teams toiled away in their labs, the ex-military populace of the Vault was given jobs that required elbow grease, and a quick-thinking sort of know-how-- security, maintenance, so on.\n\nWhat they didn't know was that the Vault was host to a terrible experiment: the development of a super soldier program originally pitched and devised by the Vault's overseer, a German scientist named Johanna Weber. She had a hypothesis that by introducing manipulated radioactive waves and implantations to the human body, that she'd be able to mutate men into perfect soldiers.\n\n...And it worked! For a small time. A quarter of the Vault's populace took note of their newfound strength, laughing and making as good of a use of it as they could-- everything from fixing vents without a screwdriver to opening a drawer too rough to scare a peer. However, eventually, the effects of the gas began to subside-- and those afflicted began to experience a strange, painless form of partial rot.\n\nThe Vault was shook-- and whilst some didn't find themselves too bothered, Alexander Pantello, the Security Chief, tried to incite an uprising. Talked down by a scientist named Grozdan Haykov, Alexander left, though they all knew he and his clique would return. To prepare, they..."
  nf_toc.1.a:0 "Scrapped whatever they could into weapons and metal."

  nf_toc.2.t:0 "The Wardens of the White"
  nf_toc.2.d:0 "The Wardens of the White were once the closest thing to a proper functioning state the north had seen outside of the raiders and the cannibals. When the Immortal and his Brotherhood came through, they were scourged from Seattle and forced to flee with their tails tucked between their legs. Some went north, where they now hang from the very trees they sought refuge in. Others went south with Anya Koester and her band of rogues, seeking hospice in The Maw with its newly-anointed Pirate Queen. The last splinter, led by the leader of the Wardens, Julius Brandt, and fell into the hands of Grozdan Haykov. While he was a kind and hospitable man, Julius was the opposite. He was embittered by his own personal tragedies, and his lack of trust brought about much strife within the Old Country. Grozdan believed that..."
  nf_toc.2.a:0 "Julius' protection was necessary."
  nf_toc.2.b:0 "Julius' authority was dangerous."

  nf_toc.3.t:0 "The Answer to Your Problems"
  nf_toc.3.d:0 "As the Rotpurgers looked to their Magic 8-Balls and a nightmarish armada of maddened women, the Wardens and Vault 100 residents toiled side by side, working desperately to try and match the speed of the raiders. While they made their nefarious schemes in Coeur d'Alene, Julius and Grozdan met to discuss their plans going forward. The Warden leader had a simple solution: to prioritize an all-out offensive doctrine when the Rotpurgers struck, pushing in as far as possible and choking them out from the inside. Grozdan, however, was less than pleased with that notion. He was afraid that such a manuever would risk more lives than it would save, and wanted to prioritize interior designs to help slow the Rotpurgers advances. In the end, however, they only had enough reasons for one course of action..."
  nf_toc.3.a:0 "Julius' Plan!"
  nf_toc.3.b:0 "Grozdan's Plan!"

  nf_toc.4.t:0 "A Quiet Talk Over a Hand of Caravan"
  nf_toc.4.d:0 "A short time after the defeat of the Rotpurgers, Julius and Grozdan chose to celebrate in private, over a game of caravan. Though Julius always lost to Grozdan's craftiness, the two old men often enjoyed these escapes from the chaos. Even still, the old Warden was bothered. There was a restlessness to him.\n\n"You're stressed." Grozdan said out of the blue, setting his cards face down.\n\n"I am." Julius replied bluntly.\n\n"Let's talk about it." Grozdan knew that if he gave Julius an option, he'd back down.\n\n"We need to think about our next move." he murmured. "Seattle's in ruins. People fight for the corpse like it's a gold rush..." he licked his burned lips, turning to Grozdan. "We need to be ready."\n\n"Our next move?" Grozdan raised his brow. "You're mistaken. We aren't soldiers. We fought for our home, and I thank you for your help, but we have little interest in expansionism."\n\n"That's a mistake. If we don't go, then they'll come for us. We can't just sit here and wait for it. We need to strike back, before it's too late."\n\nGrozdan took a deep breath. "If you want to lead your Wardens into battle, I won't stop you, Julius. I'll help you however I can, but you're making a mistake if you think it's a good idea."\n\nThen maybe that's my charge to bear, Julius thought to himself. Even so, he was uncertain..."
  nf_toc.4.a:0 "Julius took the reins."

  nf_toc.4.b:0 "Julius laid his weapon down, leaving Grozdan in authority."

  nf_toc.5.t:0 "I'm Just Saying, Things Would Have Been a Little Different"
  nf_toc.5.d:0 "Johanna was a silly choice for overseer, I think. She was always so particular about the little things, like whether or not her books were sorted by color or whether her room smelled like the right kind of tree. It amused me really, seeing how someone could care so much about such things... Growing up, I considered myself lucky to even have a roof over my head.\n\nBut I am not here to burden you with details of my birth, no? We all come from various backgrounds, and in the wasteland, tragedies are dime a dozen. Heh, I always joke that if I had been in charge, things would have been a little different for all of us. For starters? I wouldn't have turned half the Vault into ghouls. That would have made me a pretty good choice for overseer, all things considered... But then again, my good looks have gotten me pretty far in the wasteland, eh?\n\nDon't worry. I'm only kidding."
  nf_toc.5.a:0 "We've got work to do."

  nf_toc.6.t:0 "Legacy of the Lionhearted"
  nf_toc.6.d:0 "October 23rd, 2077. Nuclear armageddon struck whilst Liam Harris' unit was marooned within the hellish depths of the Cascadian Whiteout, leaving them stranded as they slowly withered into ghouls within their armor. Even as their skin became mottled and their hair fell from their scalps, they did not waver. How could they? The world may have died, but the people didn't go with it. Not all of them, and they were proof of it. Though the military no longer existed, their hearts remained stalwart in the face of adversity.\n\nYears of wandering, and they found their way to Spokane, where they met with Grozdan Haykov and the rest of the friendlies at Vault 100. Liam was quick to befriend the old Bulgarian, swearing an oath to help however he could. Now, the Lionhearted are among the greatest protectors of The Old Country."
  nf_toc.6.a:0 "God bless our troops!"

  nf_toc.7.t:0 "Strength in Division"
  nf_toc.7.d:0 "Julius Brandt and Liam Harris-- the two titans of military within the Old Spokane state. Grozdan knew there was value in both of their beliefs, but the tension between the Wardens and the Lionhearted was growing to be too much to bear. They weren't going to accept a fence-sitting answer again.\n\nOn one hand, the Wardens had an absurd amount of manpower and technology. Their doctrine of ultimate law through definite order was cruel, but in a wasteland, fitting for the state of the world. If that was not good enough, there was at least some confidence to be found in the fact that Julius had proven to value Grozdan's council.\n\nOn the other hand, the Lionhearted had served as heroes and paragons to the Old Country for much longer, but were more idealist and few in number. They held the belief that people came first, no matter the cost, which touched Grozdan's old heart, but felt impractical in the face of greater threats.\n\nWhat did Grozdan choose?"

  nf_toc.8.t:0 "Hi, My Name is..."
  nf_toc.8.d:0 "The Miscounts were once one of the greater terrors spoken about from Seattle. Basing their terminology and ideas off of long-since-closed Super-Duper Mart company policies, they inspired as much confusion as they did fear, really. While they were ultimately silly and make for a better campfire story than a genuine nemesis, it does warrant some thinking that they remain so famed for their achievements, and it's always interesting to consider that some of the Wardens still shiver when they're reminded of them.\n\nI mean, at the end of the day, would you trust somebody with a pricemaker rigged to shoot out god-knows-what?"
  nf_toc.8.a:0 "I miss when raiders had gimmicks."

  nf_toc.9.d:0 "§MFROM THE DESK OF JULIUS BRANDT.§!\n\nDoctor Haykov,\n\nWe got an interesting POS to show you today. Trust me when I say you aren't gonna guess it, either... That bastard under the Immortal, what was his name-- Rodriguez, or something alike. He's wanting to work for you now.\n\nAin't that a peach?"
  nf_toc.9.a:0 "...Uh, redemption, or something."

  nf_toc.10.t:0 "Grozdan Calls From Afar"
  nf_toc.10.d:0 "The ghouls on the mainland have done what we thought to be impossible: the liberation of Seattle and its environs from the Brotherhood. They want us to return to our ancestral lands, and they're willing to do everything in their power to help us rebuild!"
  nf_toc.10.a:0 "Home sweet home!"

  nf_toc.11.t:0 "An Old Man's Plea"
  nf_toc.11.d:0 "The Old Spokane State wishes to allow the Olympus to return to their homelands, giving us our own back in turn. Shall we accept?"

  nf_wardens.1.t:0 "Seeing Ghosts!"
  nf_wardens.1.d:0 "The Wardens of the White, once thought to be destroyed in the Immortal's occupation of Seattle, have made a grand scale return with the collapse of the Rotpurgers. Led by the fearless Julius Brandt, the resurgence of the Wardens and their doctrines have caused ample concern in an already unsteady land. One thing is for sure, however: they're going to want their old stuff back..."
  nf_wardens.1.a:0 "We'll see about that."

  nf_wardens.2.t:0 "My Buddy Loves Your Stuff"
  nf_wardens.2.d:0 "§BBENTLEY'S REPORT.§!\n\nWe've gone through the remaining Rotpurgers personnel and have found a few candidates that stick out for potential recruitment. While neither are particularly stable (which was to be expected) both command a hefty part of their remnants and with the Mesmetron technology we can absolutely make them see reason.\n\n§RProspect no. 1§! - §tSamson the Great§!\n\nCompletely insane, but oddly kind. He only displays aggression in one of two situations: when we attempt to take his magic 8-Ball from him, and when he's around too many of his boys, he gets riled up. The Mesmetron can cure one of these things, at least. His men are mouthfoamingly loyal and may be able to help us in securing Washington... Even if they're all loonier than an old half-rusted spring-coil.\n\n§RProspect no. 2§! - §0"Archdruid" Brigid§!\n\nWhile the Wishmaidens have always been rumored for their "phony Gods" and whatever-else-have-you, Brigid is a staunch reminder that they have always meant business. She's a murderer unlike any other, and she commands an armada of fellow knights that all serve as wives to her. She's a giant and she's meaner than a hungry Yao Guai-- and she made Leonard pee his suit from scaring him so damn bad. What's not to love?"
  nf_wardens.2.a:0 "Samson's Devout."

  nf_wardens.3.d:0 "§c"We keep people that mean something. These bastards are old news. Tear 'em out, we'll find new bogies to throw in their place."§!\n\nThese were the words of Brigadier-General Julius Brandt earlier that morning, and they were the words that had gathered four dozen men and women in The Cooler's main chambers. Sixteen men stood in a line behind the prisoners, their guns aimed forward in a well-orchestrated formation. When the firing started, however, some lagged: for these sorts, the puncturing of gas masks and screaming was too much. To hear such blatant suffering amidst the gunfire especially shook the newest, with two defecting in the following night. In the end, all that remained of the Rotpurgers was oxidised copper scraps and a gas mask poorly-painted gold."
  nf_wardens.3.a:0 "Was there any other way?"

  nf_wardens.4.t:0 "To Granger Storm, With Love"
  nf_wardens.4.d:0 "My name is Anya Koester. If you're hearing this, then you've heard the news by now. Wardens think they're 'back,' and all the lower raiders are panicking like they have something to be afraid of.\n\nI used to roll with them. Here's the difference between them and you, Granger: you want money, you want power? They want all that and more. You think the Brotherhood was the biggest trouble in town? At least they let you do what you want. The Wardens don't know how to keep their noses clean— they want a deed for your house to prove you 'own' it, they want you to sign up for their army, they want you to sign up your kids for their army. It's all bullshit, designed to make you a part of their 'system,' to make you forget your independence, to take away tools you can use to defend yourself. We can't let that sort of shit get smeared in our faces again.\n\nHere's my plea: give me a seat at the big table. I can help make them go away for good this time— and believe me, I've had plenty of time to think about how I'd do it."
  nf_wardens.4.a:0 "I want her in my crew."

  nf_wardens.5.t:0 "Winter's End"
  nf_wardens.5.d:0 "When the smoke had cleared, none could believe their eyes. It took dozens of strikes across several teams with well-maintained military-grade hardware, but he was gone. In the end, it was not a bomb, missile, or a .50 caliber piercing round that took the Winterborn down, but thirteen rounds from Julius Brandt's own trusted 9mm.\n\nA small vigil was held out of respect for what may have been the Warden's greatest enemy-- a twenty-one gun salute to see him down into the permafrost."
  nf_wardens.5.a:0 "May his soul find some purchase in Hell."

  nf_wardens.6.t:0 "Anya's Last Stand"
  nf_wardens.6.d:0 "Warden forces storm The Maw, scouring pirates and thieves from the Earth with fire and anti-material rounds. They were merciless, slaughtering everything they came into contact with in search of their prize: Anya Koester.\n\nBy the time they found her, she was holed up in a sewage drain. She was quick enough to realize Julius was watching her, but not quick enough to realize he had already fired a round destined for her skull."
  nf_wardens.6.a:0 "What a shame."

  nf_wardens.7.t:0 "Same Shit, Different Day"
  nf_wardens.7.d:0 "I'll never forget Seattle.\n\nWardens all around the city cried out at the same time. Eight hours is all it took to level a successful state down to nothing. Eight fucking hours. Over a century's worth of peacekeeping and local pacification, reduced to cinders and screams, like we were nothing.\n\nWe were humiliated. Hell, honestly, we're lucky we didn't lose even more to defection or otherwise. But we held our cards.\n\nThe Rotpurgers were the second biggest threat in the region, and look at what happened to them. Word on the wind is that the state's got bigger fish to fry out west. You know what that sounds like to me? Opportunity.\n\nI'm tired of watching. I'm tired of waiting. We're back, Washington. And we're coming home again."
  nf_wardens.7.a:0 "We got our work cut out for us."

  nf_wardens.8.t:0 "Word from the Maw"
  nf_wardens.8.d:0 "A holotape found its way into Fort Hundred in the midnight. When Julius put it into the player, he heard the voice of Anya Koester: one of the old guard. He thought she died at Seattle, but he supposed not everyone could be so lucky.\n\n"...—Brandt. I know you're alive, so let me ask you this: how much do you think the world wants you and your bunch of cheap-armored morons back? 'Cause trust me, and you know I'm talking from experience here, they don't. I'm gonna cut you a deal: kill yourself. Put the gun to your head, pull the trigger, and let your men forget we ever existed. And if you don't? Well, I'll be waiting. Port Maw's a rough place, but at least the raiders ambition ends at money, right? Someone better than you or I will come along one day, but not if the Wardens come back. Your order's bullshit, Brandt. And I'll be the one to make you eat it if you stay on this track, capiche? Former warden Anya Koester, signing off.""

  nf_rot.1.d:0 "Constructed beneath the city of Spokane, Vault 100 was one of the largest vaults created by Vault-Tec, designed to house proficient ex-military personnel and some of the best pre-war scientists that the world had to offer-- a time capsule of experience and knowledge for the wasteland to make use of.\n\nWhile the science and medical teams toiled away in their labs, the ex-military populace of the Vault was given jobs that required elbow grease, and a quick-thinking sort of know-how-- security, maintenance, so on.\n\nWhat they didn't know was that the Vault was host to a terrible experiment: the development of a super soldier program originally pitched and devised by the Vault's overseer, a German scientist named Johanna Weber.

This hatred only festered as they wandered the irradiated wilds, trudging through the bitter snow in search of shelter.\n\nAs the tension between the exiles and those who still lived within the Vault escalated, Alexander's caste grew restless. Over the next few years the raging bitterness that had permeated their flock only grew. What once was a generation of hardworking men and women had turned into barbarians, no better than the raiders that clashed with them in the wastes time and time again.\n\nEventually making their way east into Coeur d'Alene, they found a skirmish between two groups; the French-speaking Heat-Drinkers locked in a battle with the Badmouths, a local raider gang. Both groups were vying for control of the town, but Alexander knew they could only help one..."
  nf_rot.2.a:0 "The Heat-Drinkers!"
  nf_rot.2.b:0 "The Badmouths!"

  nf_rot.3.t:0 "The Three Splinters"
  nf_rot.3.d:0 "With their ranks filled out with more of the Wasteland's worst, the now-Rotpurgers experienced a culture shift. Many began to see the women among them as a commodity to be owned rather than equals in arms. This led to a schism, with many of the group's women leaving in search of a new home. They found a home and salvation amongst the nearby Wishmaidens tribe and their eerie faux-deity; the Lady of the Lake. Under her they formed a new and strange clergy far removed from their male cohorts, practising odd rites and learning unnatural abilities.\n\nThen came along Sir Samson.\n\nHe had been born a Rotpurger: a scrawny, twitchy little man who often heard voices that no one else could. The rest of the Purgers disliked his manic turns and believed him to be a worthless and unreliable runt at best but tolerated him for many years. Those who bullied him found themselves facing many 'coincidental' misfortunes; a live grenade found in someone's morning coffee however was the final straw and Samson was exiled from the Rotpurgers, destined to never return... Or, at least, they had hoped.\n\nIn his lone wanderings, he found kinship in a strange thing— a black Orb with the symbol of infinity emblazoned upon it that could answer his many questions and assuage his endless doubts and fears. Newly confident, almost arrogant, Samson returned to the Rotpurger territory as a prophet of sorts using his new "Infinity Orb" to give guidance and speak the will of his new gods. It was not long before he had gathered a group of loyal if somewhat deranged followers branded as his Infinity Knights.\n\nComing to Jacobia, Samson claimed to have a plan to mobilise against the Vault— seeking to unite the Wishmaidens, the Rotpurgers, and his own Infinity Knights in one glorious charge against Grozdan's loyalists. Jacobia was sceptical, but the fervent nature of the 'Infinity-Prophets' conviction convinced him to make overtures to the Wishmaidens and their sceptical Lady. Together the three reassembled in Coeur d'Alene to discuss an alliance between their different forces, hoping for the best."
  nf_rot.3.a:0 "Samson's promise drove many newcomers to the region."
  nf_rot.3.b:0 "The three raised walls where once there was none."

  nf_rot.4.t:0 "Who Could Have Seen This Coming?"
  nf_rot.4.d:0 "The deed was done, the Old Country had fallen and the Rot had been purged. For so long life among the Purgers had revolved around this ancient hate and war but what would they do now? The loose alliance between the three powers no longer had much purpose and all within the Purgers knew change was in the air.\n\nA meeting had been called for the leaders to meet and discuss the future, though the tension in the air among each group foreshadowed strongly at how things would play out. Jacobia had chosen the meeting place, an old warehouse that had been repurposed as a town hall of sorts, and had quietly placed groups of men loyal to him in the buildings all around. For security purposes of course. He expected those weak and whining Wishmaidens to be difficult to keep in line, though it was anyone's guess what that madman Samson would do.\n\nThe Lady and her Wishmaidens flooded the room soon after, donning their oxidised bits of armour and dainty furs. Creusa counted Jacobia's men hidden in the crannies and rafters of the warehouse. So he had chosen this approach? How droll. She turned to him—her gaze unsettling as it was ethereal. "Jacobia," she greeted.\n\n"Lady," Jacobia leered. "Where's Samson?" He noted her numbers, but it bothered him none; they both knew how this was going to pan out.\n\n"Should I be the one to know?" She asked, tilting her head. "It seems you have eyes everywhere." She gestured a signal—the Wishmaidens readied their arms.\n\n"Guess it makes no difference," scoffed Jacobia, readying his own.\n\nFar away from the meeting place, Samson held his followers in waiting well beyond the appointed time. The mystic orb had told him there would be bloodshed, spoke of the impending end of the alliance, and assured him that it was Samson who'd come out on top in the chaos. What had Samson huddled under an old rowboat divining with the orb for hours, as his knights patiently waited in the whipping wind, was when to make his move.\n\nBut who's chapter did this evening turn to?"
  nf_rot.4.a:0 "Samson's Infinity Knights!"
  nf_rot.4.b:0 "Jacobia's Rotpurgers!"
  nf_rot.4.c:0 "The Lady's Wishmaidens!"

  nf_rot.5.t:0 "A Woman Came From Afar"
  nf_rot.5.d:0 "Once, there was a simple woman, descended from the ilk of Vault 100, who lived a subtle life within the lands of the Timberline. She lived a simple life until one day wayward Inquisitors, raiders from the Rotpurgers, burned her house down for 'harboring mutant sympathies. Not knowing what to do, she disappeared into the forest, unknowingly heeding a mysterious call from the deep.\n\nHer hatred of the Inquisition blinded her senses and poisoned her mind. At first, it began with stealing supplies. Then, it was ambushing and killing entire patrols. Firebombs to garrisons. To her, it seemed like she had fallen into a dark abyss with no escape in sight. But the more she fell, the more the voice called upon her, sweet yet sick. At first, the call felt random, indecipherable, even nauseating: a serenade that felt like she was screaming.\n\nBut as she communed with nature more and more, she began to understand. No longer her hatred of the Inquisition hold any sway over her. She no longer felt hate against the mutants, the inquisition or anyone for that matter. Spending day after day in doubt, the day she finally opened her heart to the Maiden of Wishes became the day she found her calling: to preserve the living at all costs, for she knew that the dark abyss of hatred brings nothing but the most wicked of evils.\n\nNow all who roam the lands of Cascadia know the legend of Brigid, the Wishmaiden witch-warrior with a heart of silvered steel: the firstmost champion of the Fair Lady Within The Lake."
  nf_rot.5.a:0 "All bowed before Brigid's might."

  nf_rot.6.t:0 "Jacobia's Rotpurgers!"
  nf_rot.6.d:0 "The Wishmaidens were idiots to think they had any chance against his Rotpurgers. The fight was swift—the Rotpurgers gaining the upper hand from their hidden stations. Jacobia revelled in the chaos. It was a dream come true—for long he had waited for an opportunity to squash the pesky Wishmiadens.\n\nOnce it was over, a satisfying silence loomed over the warehouse. "Pillage the corpses and burn the bodies!" Jacobia barked. The Rotpurgers quickly got to work. He stood before the body of the Lady, spitting a lob of blood against her dress. He sneered at the peaceful air around her corpse. Even in death, she didn't seem to give a shit.\n\nThough, Jacobia was always curious to see the wench beyond the mask, and so he reached over and pulled it off, scoffing at the sight. "Of course, it's a fuckin' ghoul," he murmured, shooting another bullet into the Lady's gnarled forehead.\n\n"'Hoss, you might wanna take a look at this," said a Purger. Jacobia stood up and followed him outside with the other Rotpurgers in tow.\n\nTo his amusement, just out near the woods and by an old stream, huddled around and overturned was Samson and his Infinity Knights. "...And will it be ours, now?" Samson's voice rang out boisterously.\n\n'Don't count on it,' read the bright text on his god-damned ball.\n\n"Would you look at that?" Chuckled Jacobia. "Hey, Samson," he waved, raising his gun as the golden-masked maniac looked up. "Bye, Samson!""
  nf_rot.6.a:0 "And so the evening ended with a clean purge."

  nf_rot.7.t:0 "The Lady's Wishmaidens!"
  nf_rot.7.d:0 "The Wishmaidens had won their brief skirmish with the Rotpurgers. The Lady watched calmly in the centre of the madness; bullets, shrapnel, and blood merely grazing her. And when the madness died down, she stepped towards Jacobia's body. His breath was haggard, and his mask had been torn off, revealing a grimace accentuated with maddened, glazed eyes.\n\n"...Bitch," spat Jacobia.\n\nThe Lady stooped down before him. "Save your strength," she whispered as she grabbed his face and tilted it towards her. "For I will set you free." Though her grip on Jacobia's jaw tightened none, he trembled beneath her. Blood began to leak from his nose, eyes, and ears. She dropped him back to the ground soon after. "Scavenge what you can. Then we leave," she commanded, brushing past her Wishmaidens as they scurried to work.\n\n"What of Samson?"

Huddled in the dark under the rotting boat.\n\n"Divine Gods, Is it time to attack?" Samson asked once more. An Infinity Knight failed to stifle a cough. Barely legible in the flickering flame of his old Vault-Tec branded lighter, came the answer, 'It is decidedly so'. With an hoot of delight Samson tossed away his makeshift shelter and stood up tall before his shivering warriors. Holding high the snapping jaws of his bear trap gauntlet, Samson gave the Knights the signal to charge.\n\nThe battle that had taken place between the Wishmaidens and Jacobia's followers had been savage and bloody, with most of the fighters on both sides dead when the Infinity Knights arrived. The Wishmaidens had come out on top in the fray but had lost too many of their number to give the new arrivals more than a token resistance. The Lady herself had been kneeling over Jacobia as he slowly died beneath her, her attention focused on the fallen former leader and their parting words.\n\n"VICTORY BEHOLD!" cried Samson as he crashed through a window. When the mad leader of the Knights landed on steady ground, he sprinted at Lady with his bear trap gauntlet at the ready. The Lady had time to do no more than sigh."

It had been a short time since they set up the old battered GECK they'd won off those wacko dancer types, and as far as Jacobia knew they were supposed to change the land and make it nice to live in. He and his fellow Purgers certainly deserved such a reward after all the hard work and sacrifices they'd made, so he allowed himself a bit of optimism about what he'd find in the formerly barren area. Those good vibes crumbled as he reached the top and looked down.\n\nInside his mask Jacobia's jaw dangled wide open for a while as his guards made their way up onto the ridge behind him, their gasps and murmuring reflecting his own feelings. There were trees and bushes where before there had been rocks and snow sure, but in place of the healthy greens he'd expected were garish reds and bruised purples that hurt his eyes to look at. It was different but uncomfortably similar to the strange red forests the Bonedancers had made their homes in, at least before they'd been burned out. Numbly, Jacobia slid down the hillside towards the valley to take a closer look with his guards close behind.\n\nThey soon walked under the unsettling canopy, listening to the strange scraping noise the leaves made as the wind gently rustled them. Dangling from the branches of the trees were large, blue fruits covered in strange growths, and the bushes were heavy-laden with thorny berries in yellow and orange. The entire wood had an odor that crept through their masks and reminded them of the rancid stink of burning ghouls. Only the spring that had arisen in the heart of his new forest looked right to them, burbling cheerfully amidst the unnatural. Jacobia had seen more than enough then and marched right back out of the valley until they were well clear of the trees before saying one thing to his men."

Standing before the great tower that climbed unto the very heavens, only more impressive for the mass of shattered buildings that sprawled around it, gave Samson a moment of pause however. A moment of clarity in his normally muddy mind as he thought about what life had been like only a few scant years ago. From being the beaten dog of the Rotpurgers to scrabbling through the wilderness alone to his discovery of the mystic sphere that had been his companion through all the many battles he and his knights had fought to reach this ground.\n\nGrateful tears ran beneath his mask, as were it not for the Infinity Mind he'd have truly had no clue where to begin on the long and twisted journey that had brought him to this moment of glory. His faithful knights waited behind, unwilling to interrupt their prophet in his moment of reverie, instead watching for any threats that may emerge from the ruins. Finally the moment had passed and Samson tightly grasped at the wondrous Orb that had given him so much guidance before asking quietly "Are we home?". A quick shake and the reply was a simple: 'Yes'.\n\nUnable to contain himself any longer Samson let loose with a shriek of pure exhilaration and joy before running towards the tower. His knights scrambled to follow their leader as his mania sent him speeding ahead. Calling back to them Samson cried "THE GODS HAVE GIFTED US A NEW HOME, ONE FROM WHICH WE CAN VIEW THEIR MANY WORKS FROM ON HIGH!". Soon he was dashing up the great stairs that spiralled around the outside of the tower, nearly hurling himself from the edge in his excitement multiple times.

It took many days for the Orb to reveal the secrets of proper use and maintenance of the mighty suits of armour but its wisdom had eventually provided as always. Now it was time to decide who among the ranks would be given the right to one, and Samson had assembled his greatest warriors to be judged of their worthiness.\n\nWalking down the line and stopping before each of the eager champions Samson made a grand ceremony of each judging; holding out the great Orb to the prospect as he shouted to the heavens "SHOULD THIS KNIGHT BE GRANTED A SHIMMERING SUIT OF SHINING STEEL TO BATTLE AT MY SIDE FOREVER!? SPEAK YOUR JUDGEMENT GODS". A cheer went out as the first in line, Sir Lucas, read aloud the reply: 'You May Rely On It'. Samson himself cheered along, leaping in joy.\n\nThis process was repeated with each hopeful Knight. Cheers erupted at each of the Orb's chosen worthies, silence greeted those who were told that the reply was hazy and to ask again later, and conciliatory pats on the back were given to those for whom the outlook was not so good. The sun rose to its apex and began to set before the judging was over, and Samson's powerful cries to the gods had taken a decidedly hoarse tone, but when it was over there stood a proud group of heroes ready to be suited up and fight unto infinity."

Their ridiculous orb had failed to give them any guidance in the days after the 'meeting', and the Wishmaidens were able to round up the bulk of them at their leisure. Samson himself had emerged from his hideout with slumped shoulders to peacefully surrender after The Lady had called for him to consult the ball on whether he'd been defeated. Upon the face of the Orb he clutched tight in his hands were written the words 'Without a Doubt'.\n\nDetermined to expose the distinctly mortal nature of her one time ally, The Lady held a public gathering to humiliate the mad prophet. She began by executing the Orb itself, shattering it with the weight of her contempt and skepticism. Held in chains and stripped of his armor and mask, Samson gave out a choked squeal as it fell to powder in her hands. His former followers watched on and flinched as hot tar was then poured over him and feathers were dumped over the top. As his bonds were released the former knight fled shrieking and gibbering from the scene, into the forest.\n\nThose who had once viewed his word as holy knew then that he and his Orb had been nothing in the face of the Lady and her power, renouncing their former loyalties to Samson. They would assimilate with the Wishmaidens in the days that followed, giving themselves to a new cause peacefully. As for the former prophet of infinity he would be spotted sometimes afterwards roaming the wastes, always mumbling endless questions to which no answers were forthcoming."

"Why did you bring me here?" She asked.\n\n"Why did I?" Creusa mused with a knowing chuckle. They'd found the girl just recently; hidden under the collapsed remains of a Rotpurger stronghold. Whoever her father was, he was most likely gone; ran or killed, the difference mattered none. "I hear you are hurt, and that you refuse treatment from the Clergy."\n\nCreusa could sense it then; a risible, clawing fear of something resentful and hopeless. She recognized it. It was the sort that drowns you in the woods. She grabbed the girl's arm and pulled her to the ground before she could run. The coat shucked off from the girl's shoulders, revealing untreated burns all over her skin. The girl's fierce gaze demanded she'd be let go.\n\n"What would you have then if I did?" Countered Creusa who shoved a cup of soup in the girl's other hand. "Drink this, and then, when you are finished, you can lose yourself to the wilds."\n\nHesitantly, the girl obliged, drinking slowly from the cup. In the meantime, Creusa fetched her coat and placed it back gently onto her shoulder, humming a slow song as she did.

Screwy little Samson was holding court here today, for reasons that probably made sense to him, and she was hoping to get a meeting with the man. Each time she asked one of his knights whether she could see him, he'd walk off and then return to say something pointless like 'hazy reply' or 'better not tell you now'. It was infuriating, and she'd have left if her stubbornness had let her, but she kept asking whenever a knight walked by. Finally one of them opened the door and told her "Signs point to yes!"\n\nInside they pointed her to the office where Samson was decorating the walls with scribbles of his infinity symbol. He'd been cheerfully mumbling to himself when Gabrielle entered, but turned his golden gaze upon her after she made a few less than subtle coughs. In his off hand rested the Orb that was his constant companion. She'd never actually seen it before and it was less impressive than she'd imagined; just a dull black ball with a small window looking inside.\n\nSamson looked down to the Orb too, following her gaze before looking back up and loudly greeting her, nearly shouting "Welcome to the Study of Sir Samson!

His thoughts ran over the last few weeks and how well it had all gone. The home of his fathers had been reclaimed, the ghouls had been put to the torch, that sneaky Bitch of the Lake was dead and poor, stupid, crazy Samson lay in a shallow grave right next to her. "I should be happy" he said to no one in particular, using a dart to pick at his teeth before tossing it after the others.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door followed by a muffled voice saying "Boss, we've got her downstairs. You want her?"\n\n"Yeah get her ass up here, let's get this over with." Jacobia replied while hurling the last dart irritably.\n\nGabrielle has been both a help and a pain in his ass over the last few years. There was no doubt she'd been loyal, or that she hadn't wanted to reclaim Vault 100 from the zombies as much as anyone else. She had proved that by staying when so many of the 'purgers women had snuck off to join the wishfucks. She was useful too; smart, good at setting up workshops and finding fuel for the flame smiths, but she was so damn mouthy and too smart. She kept trying to get his men to stop and build shops and farms and shit like that. Jacobia wanted to rally his men for something greater, to build an army of fire that would purge all those rotten ghouls from the wasteland. Now maybe she had a point, a crusade couldn't march very without food or weapons, but maybe it didn't matter if she had a point if she was pissing him off.\n\nFootsteps could be heard approaching as he stood up and put his mask back on. He grunted in response to the knock that came after, and two of his men led Gabrielle into the room. Jacobia could tell the woman had no idea how close to disaster she was, as she wasted no time in speaking up "Jacobia, I'm glad you wanted me to come see you! Now that Vault 100 and Spokane are pure there's so much more to be done. We have a chance to build something to really last here."\n\nThe silence that filled the room after she finished did seem to make her nervous then, and she looked to the men flanking her and back to Jacobia looking for any sign of agreement.

Those who had forsaken their past championed her name under the Wishmaidens tribe-- now, however, the tribe has become more a clergical order. Creusa guides the Wishmaidens with a soothing (if not terrifying) hand and words that turn foes into friends. She envisions a word crafted in her ideals and will stop at nothing to achieve them."
  ROT_god_king_samson_name:0 "God-King Samson"
  ROT_god_king_samson_desc:0 "A deranged sycophant under Jacobia's reign of the Rotpurgers, Samson's ambition outweighs his own moral code. Left with nothing but a mystical orb to guide him, he has since assumed the title of Infinity Prophet. At the mantle, Samson seeks to claim what he sees as his divine birthright. For him, adversaries are but future subjects, ignorant to his grandeur. By the end of his scourge, should he succeed, all will bow to the one they call Samson."
  ROT_brigit_name:0 "Archdruid Brigid"
  brigit_army_chief_desc:0 "§G"The villains of this world did well to fear me once; now, they shall do so again, this time with a sledge twice-honed, and a faith stronger than ever."§!\n\nOnce, there was a simple woman, descended from the ilk of Vault 100, who lived a subtle life within the lands of the Timberline. One day wayward Inquisitors burned her house down for 'harboring mutant sympathies.' Not knowing what to do, she disappeared into the forest, unknowingly heeding a mysterious call from the deep.\n\nHer hatred of the Inquisition blinded her senses and poisoned her mind. At first, it began with stealing supplies. Then, it was ambushing and killing entire patrols. Firebombs to garrisons. To her, it seemed like she had fallen into a dark abyss with no escape in sight. But the more she fell, the more the voice called upon her, sweet yet sick. At first, the call felt random, indecipherable, even nauseating: a serenade that felt like she was screaming.\n\nNow all who roam the lands of Cascadia know the legend of Brigid, slayer of Alexander the Merciless, the Wishmaiden witch-warrior with a heart of silvered steel: the firstmost champion of the Fair Lady Within The Lake."

  ROT_galahadria_name:0 "Warmother Galahadria"
  galahadria_advisor_desc:0 "§G"My axe has slaughtered would-be kings and queens like a wolf's jaw would gut a sheep's stomach, my Lady my finest witness. I would be filled with nothing but glee to spill your entrails upon the dredges of the Whiteout."§!\n\nGalahadria was once an Enclave officer, much like MacDoogle, though the Lady relieved her of her memories of such things. Even so, her might and power is the greatest of the four Clerics of the Wishing Well-- a titan of a woman, once tutor to Brigid, now a vanguard against all evils.\n\nHer armor was purloined from Midwestern travelers who attempted to cause a scene within Edgemere, but met their end at her great bumper sword. Now, imbued with the Lady's blessing, they say her armor glows like a worm within the night-- a terrifying glimmer upon the nightly horizons."
  ROT_lancella_name:0 "Runeseamstress Lancella"
  lancella_advisor_desc:0 "§G"The truest heart is that of the people of the land-- the truly innocent. Those burdened by the guilt of their neighbors. Let us be rid of the monsters!"§!\n\nLancella was a woman of the people, raised from Edgemere tribals and the original Wishmaidens. Her devotion to the Lady and her doctrines of truth is without question, and so her time is spent bonding with the commonfolk and routing perceived corruption within the land.\n\nTo the Rotpurgers, she was a scourge unlike any other: a woman who killed without question, disregarding Samson's truce. While she may be considered unruly, her heart and love is above her sisters, and so her disobedience is overlooked."
  ROT_palamyde_name:0 "Scryer Palamyde"
  palamyde_advisor_desc:0 "§G"Do you believe in second chances? I didn't... But here I stand."§!\n\nBeloved was Palamyde, a former woman of Olympus who forsook her tribe to seek healing under the Lady. Though her illness was beyond that of the Fair Lady's grace, the Lady of the Lake gave other gifts: boons of strength, tallies of belief, weapons imbued with her very blood. On that fateful day, Palamyde devoted whatever remained of her life to the Lady of the Lake, taking a hammer up in her name. Though weakened she may be, she fights alongside her sisters without fear, knowing that her place in the great beyond is but guaranteed."

  rot_friends_til_the_end_flag:0 "The Four Clerics of the Wishing Well must be assembled!"

  ROT_inquisitor_tack_name:0 "Inquisitor Tack"
  ROT_inquisitor_tack_advisor_desc:0 "§R"A shame we live in a world that requires men in my position at all my friend. Mistakes need correcting however, even gods."§!\n\nThe "Gentleman Inquisitor" of the Rotpurgers, Tack is a charming and soft-spoken man who gets along easily with his fellows as well as those he is called upon to inspect. Always carrying a pack of cigars to share or a bottle of whiskey he insists can't be polished off alone, Tack has friends all over the Rotpurgers' territory. That affability hides a ruthless and unwavering dedication to the Inquisitorial mandate however, and there is no small number of settlements and individuals who have been convinced to turn over any information they have on nearby ghouls or mutants. The friendly face never drops however, even as he wipes his hands clean over a burning body."

  ROT_wallace_grun_name:0 "Wallace Grun"
  ROT_wallace_grun_advisor_desc:0 "§R"I know the price of fucking up, of going soft. It's blood and fire. Better they burn than me."§!\n\nKnown better as the Branded Bloodhound, Wallace is a man driven by his past suffering. When leading a raiding party in 2270, Wallace was merciful and allowed his foes to flee the field without pursuit. Those survivors then went on to warn every other settlement in the path of the Rotpurgers advance and aided in building up their defenses. Furious, Jacobia had the unfortunate commander tortured and finally branded with a crude iron. The infection that set into the wound nearly killed the man, leaving a gruesome flame shaped series of scars across his face. In the years since Wallace has regained his former position and more, driving his men harder than any others and earning a reputation for being the most dogged of pursuers. Those who know the Bloodhound is coming know they must win or they will die, no retreat."

  ROT_macdoogle_name:0 "Sergeant MacDoogle"
  ROT_macdoogle_advisor_desc:0 "§R"Thirteen tangoes on the other side of the ridge. Scouts watching the road. You three go 'purger' and make a distraction. Rest of the unit will move through the trees to surprise."§!\n\nMacDoogle is not a Rotpurger by descent, but he has found a place among them nonetheless. Having arrived from the east and claiming to have left Missoula, MacDoogle carries himself with the air of an experienced and trained soldier. He has passed on what he knows to those around him, tightening up the group's operation wherever he goes. Where other Rotpurger squads are hollering mobs of flamethrower toting fanatics and psychopaths, those under the Sergeant are disciplined and discreet, wasting nothing and bringing back more intact loot than their fellows. Despite these successes and obvious skills however, Jacobia is cautious around MacDoogle. Not because he lacks a dedication to burning away the world's impurities, but because he can never be quite sure if the Sergeant is an Enclave deserter or an Enclave spy."

  ROT_taven_name:0 "Captain Taven"
  ROT_taven_advisor_desc:0 "§Y"I'll hold them."§!\n\nTaven spent his youth among the Rotpurgers, often treated as an imbecile by the rest despite his great size and strength. They misinterpreted his quiet and deliberate manner of speaking and acting as stupidity. It was Samson, fresh out of the wilderness with his wondrous Orb in tow, who took a liking to the massive man and befriended him. Taven provided Samson with some of his first muscle, and lended the smaller prophet of infinity an air of legitimacy when dealing with other ruffians and misfits. In the long days since Taven has become Samson's trusted Captain, and has stood firm through battles that would have destroyed lesser men. Fearless and cleverly determined on defense, he is the wall that waves of enemies break upon. Samson considers Taven to be his beloved boulder, while Taven privately considers his master a complete maniac. A maniac he's happy to protect however."

  ROT_yusuf_name:0 "Yusuf the Found"
  ROT_yusuf_advisor_desc:0 "§Y"The Orb says we can smash through the gates and take them head on. I have faith, do you?"§!\n\nYusuf was lost, resigned to dying alone in the icy forests of Cascadia when he heard the unmistakable crunching of boots in the snow. The source of those footsteps was a scrawny little man holding a black ball and smiling strangely as he approached Yusuf. He introduced himself as Samson, and in response to Yusuf's desperate requests for directions to civilization he simply shook the ball. As he shook it, the man cried out and asked if south was the path to salvation. Through a window in the ball, came the written response: “It is certain”. Baffled but without any better ideas Yusuf turned south and to his shock he soon made it back home safe and sound. Not long after, Samson rose to prominence as the leader of his own gang of followers who believed him a prophet. Yusuf remembered the casual confidence of the small man in the woods, and knew he had to join as well. Now he is among the most faithful of the Infinity Knights, a man who leads offensives and breaks sieges fearlessly. What is there to fear when you're following a divine plan?"

  ROT_red_bears_name:0 "Red Bears"
  ROT_red_bears_advisor_desc:0 "§O"There were three sentries set up here, and another two on the western hill. I've handled them, so the enemy should be blind to our approach."§!\n\nAn outsider, Red Bears true name is unknown to the rest of the group. When asked he will tell you that his name doesn't matter, that it died with his people in the frigid peaks of the Rocky Mountains. Instead he is named by his fellows for the two ragged, crimson teddy bears that are strapped to his shoulder pads. The taciturn tribal takes no interest in politics or internal strife, and he instead chooses to focus his attention on those outside the borders. Reconnaissance, scouting, and nightly operations into enemy territory are his trademarks, and those skills are always in high demand in the war torn and harsh wilderness of Cascadia. There are whispers occasionally amongst the soldiers that the bodies he leaves in his wake often have small bites taken out of them."

  ROT_wolfslapper_name:0 "Sir Wolfslapper"
  ROT_wolfslapper_advisor_desc:0 "§Y"I've mapped the approach through the hills and ensured my party is geared up and ready for the next sortie... What? Yes... I'll slap them silly sir."§!\n\nMap every other pass in the mountains and hills and no one blinks. Get your knights through a dozen battles unscathed and they say that's to be expected when the wisdom of the Orb is at work. Slap one timber wolf trying to snatch up your brahmin steak however and you become a legend. Such is the tale of Sir Wolfslapper, named by his comrades in arms and canonized by the great Samson himself. While he'd like to think his other contributions are more important to the success of the Infinity Knights, Wolfslapper can't deny how much it's helped with morale. So on his power fists go, such that he may slap his way to everlasting glory in the eye of the infinite."

  ROT_granny_blast_name:0 "Granny Blast"
  ROT_granny_blast_advisor_desc:0 "§R"Pathetic it's taken so long for those shit-smelling zombies to be cleared out. A real man would have burned them out when my hair wasn't grey and falling out but I guess those are too hard to come by these days."§!\n\nEven amongst folks as mean-spirited and spiteful as the Rotpurgers there are few as legendarily ornery as Evelyn Dufrane, known better as Granny Blast. Old enough to remember the great exiling from Vault 100 and their initial struggle to survive in the unforgiving winter, she has known every generation of the Rotpurgers to date. Weapons of the pyromantic or explosive variety are her specialty, and many a purger has spent the evening listening to her bitter ranting and rambling as she has repaired their flamer or assembled a basket of improvised explosives for their raids. No one is above her vitriol, not her apprentices and not even Jacobia himself, but she is too valuable to the group for anyone to do more than suffer her rancor."

  ROT_boofbert_name:0 "Boofbert "The Waybeast""
  ROT_boofbert_advisor_desc:0 "§Y"Woof!"§!\n\nLife was simple for a dog named Boofbert. He sniffed things, hunted radstag and molerats with his beloved owner Roberta, slept by the fire and spent free time gnawing on an old deathclaw femur. It was a good life. Then a group of strange and excitable knights rolled into town and took an immediate interest in the hound. For on the pooch's backside was a discolored patch of fur that looks vaguely like the number eight, if you turned your head and squinted a bit. Such could only be a sign from the Great Infinite the knights said, and they insisted on bringing Boofbert to meet their leader. It was not long before the dog had the approval of Sir Samson himself and was lionized as The Waybeast, a creature blessed with knowing where to go and what to do when the Orb itself could not be present. Now knights come before the dog to ask questions and interpret his responses when Samson cannot be reached, always with the perpetually bemused Roberta watching on."

  ROT_broilo_name:0 "Broil-O"
  ROT_broilo_advisor_desc:0 "§O"Setting temperature output to approximately 1292 degrees Fahrenheit for 5 minutes, when ashen black, please add salt and pepper to taste."§!\n\nThe Grand Spokane Hotel found itself raking in money before the war, serving the US military, Vault-Tec employees and others besides. They invested some of that money into a live dinner and floor show put on by the latest robotic cooks and chefs. It was a smash hit with local diners and guests alike, until a fatal accident in which the head chef doused the dining room in boiling peanut oil resulted in the hotel being shut down. The bombs fell before it was able to reopen, and it was the Rotpurgers who one day walked in to poke and prod the ruins. Broil-O, the decommissioned former head chef of the Grand Spokane, was successfully switched back on and even given some new directives to go along with his rapidly corrupting programming. Whether cooking food or foes, Broil-O is excited to serve!"

He's had two centuries to perfect guerilla warfare on a scale unimaginable and his men's loyalty wavers only in death.\n\nThis isn't about who's got the bigger guns anymore. This is a man who has been through two hundred years of punishment and lived to tell about it. This isn't a battle for land, or for resources— it's a war for history.

Then, men in power armored suits came out of the Blizzard, and we were forced to retreat. In the chaos, raiders poured in from the coast, carving out whatever they could of Portland for themselves. We were left embarrassed and afraid, running from our territory with our tails tucked between our legs.\n\nSome of us escaped south to join the raiders in Port Maw, hoping to strike a new life amongst liars and thieves. Others ran north, into Bellingham, where ropes now hold them from trees. Us? We fled east, into the hills. We found solace and purpose again in helping Grozdan Haykov, but times changed and opportunities arose. We took our numbers and we made our due.\n\nWe're in charge, but we're far from back.
