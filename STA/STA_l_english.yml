  ### Characters
  STA_DUALITY_NAME: "The Couple"
  STA_DUALITY_DESC: "The Stampede is led by their two great families, Lockhearts and the Sundells. \n\nJohn Lockheart was a frontiersman, an unruly citizen of the Canadian People's Front who turned freedom fighter and now figurehead. He and the rest of the Lockhearts rule with doctrines of 'older law,' and frontier justice. \n\nAmy-Lee Sundell was of the tribes near Stoon, pushed out by the growing influence of the Dandelion party and disease. Thusly, it was she who led her tribesfolk into Alberta, where they aided the Lockhearts in vanquishing bandits and fake republics. \n\nNow, both lead the Great Stampede together-- as husband and wife."

  STA_sundell_name:0 "Amy-Lee Sundell"
  STA_army_sundell_chief_desc:0 "The Sundells have never been ones to give up easily, though they have endured long hardship across the years. Their roads led out of Stoon, through shadowed and dark woods and even darker deeds that left them red of hand and tooth. Now however things are much brighter, as they stand hand in hand with the Lockheart family.\n\nAmy has done what she must to bring her tribe to these lands and better times, having used her wits, charm and strength alike to see them through trouble and keep them fed. She hopes that never more will she have to resort to the flesh of thinking men to survive however, and that together the Sundells and Lockhearts will build a lasting future. If nothing else, she finds solace in the love of her husband John."
  STA_lockheart_name:0 "John Lockheart"
  STA_army_lockheart_chief_desc:0 "The Lockheart's resounding resilience has always been the trait that the clan has taken the most pride in– their ability to ‘weather the storm’, as they themselves have put it, has allowed them to survive the CPF, eventually taking hold of the steppes and strike out the Cab Vultures, hand in hand with the Sundell tribe.\n\nBut John has learned something special, as his clan clashed against the raider gang, the tribes bolstering them through and through during the war. This resilence stems not from ‘toughness’, ‘grit’, or even prime Lockheart specialty– but their love for one another. Love that he now finds in his wife, Amy."

  STA_mickey_name:0 "Mickey Thompson"
  STA_mickey_high_command_desc:0 "If many of the Lockharts have a penchant for dueling, few have proven better suited to it than Mickey. Not with a sword, like their Patriarch or his copycats, but with the ancient art of the revolver.\n\nSome claim he was raised with a gun in his hand, practicing his shots on zig-zagging bloatflies since he could walk. Some say he found his calling after stumbling upon a cursed six shooter in an abandoned supermarket while searching for food. Others say he read about dueling cowboys from an old comic book and started challenging the other kids with rubber band guns and never quite grew out of it. Either way, folks travel from around the north to see his trick shooting, or sometimes to foolishly test his skills beneath a high noon."
  STA_sara_name:0 "Sara"
  STA_sara_high_command_desc:0 ""
  STA_liam_name:0 "Liam Gabriel"
  STA_liam_economic_desc:0 "The children of the Canadian People's Front are brought up on the victories of Communism, past, present, future. When reality doesn't match the stories, well, some don't take it too well.\n\nLiam was once a driver in the CPF's Spear, their armored division. First behind the wheel of a truck, before being given control of the armored bulk of one of their functional Soviet tanks. As the CPF continued to crumble beneath the weight of its flaws, so too did Liam's once unshakable belief in the cause slowly wear away. The great battle against the assembled forces of the Lockharts and Sundells proved to be his final time fighting for the Front. Even if their terrible loss there hadn't proven how weak they had become, his tank was shattered in the fighting and Liam was the only survivor captured from the wreckage.\n\nWhy the Stampede kept him alive, he didn't know, but it was some time before he convinced his captors to give him a chance to prove he would leave his old life behind to join their new society. Now he shares his knowledge of vehicles with the Lockhart craftsmen, raising a new generation of mechanics that can more than match with the skills of the CPF, the Cab Vultures, and any other would be black thumb in Canada."
  STA_valerie_name:0 "Valerie Omaima"
  STA_valerie_cultural_desc:0 "Valerie was young when Amy-Lee put an end to the Sundell's consumption of corpses. But not so young as to have avoided the act, nor too young to have savored it. All the years of abstinence while growing into a warrior of the tribe, of putting on a front for their new allies in the Lockharts, hearing all the speeches coming down from their Matriarch, and still the craving never left. \n\nWhile many others have followed their leaders in putting that piece of the past behind them, there are still those who gather in the woods on a dark night and drag out the bodies of the fallen for a midnight sacrament."
  STA_old_zed_name:0 "Old Zed"
  STA_old_zed_economic_desc:0 "Some of the Cab Vulture families were more mechanically inclined than others, focusing on creating and repairing the motors and machines than running them. Old Zed, as he’s affectionately known, is the crotchety and pragmatic head of one such family. He and his kin are experts at repurposing old tech and bringing it back to life, thanks to a knack for engineering and modest library of collected old world manuals. Zed doesn’t much care for who’s running Alberta as long as he’s got space to work and roam."

  ##events

  nf_sta.1.t:0 "The Canadian People's Front"
  nf_sta.1.d:0 "The Canadian People's Front-- a disaster of a state that has long since been fragmenting. Seven years ago, eastern Alberta broke free of its grasp-- and from it spawned several nation-states, all vying for a piece of the puzzle left behind. From them all, however, two did stand at the end, and from two came one: The Great Stampede. A conglomeration of frontiersfolk, tribals, and other individuals who were tired of living under the thumb of their scarlet overlords. People who wanted MORE out of life than just following Crown or Council. To many, they could find easy harborage in either Lockheart of Sundell lifestyles; living off the land in both flavors of rodeo-riding and tribal agriculture. For once, life became simple. For once, life became quiet. For once, life was about your neighbor and not about the world."
  nf_sta.1.a:0 "People rejoiced, working in tandem to create things."
  nf_sta.1.b:0 "People wanted to help out however they could."
  nf_sta.1.c:0 "People shared by choice."

  nf_sta.2.t:0 "In Every Heart a Dream"
  nf_sta.2.d:0 "In the heart of every man or woman across the Albertan Steppes is a dream. Thrice now has it been shattered: once by the world before by American boots and Canadian failures, twice by the nuclear armageddon and the nuclear fallout that ensued, thrice by the Canadian People's Front which flew too close to the sun one too many times. \n\nIn these hearts, these frontiersmen crave one thing: peace. The Stampede is bold; brave. It is ruled by no singular governing entity but by the love of the people, love derived from John Lockheart and Amy-Lee Sundell. This passion, though guided by it, is not fueled by the hum of cicadas in the dead of night, nor inspired by the beautifully sweet scents on the wind, but by ambition and gumption. Those who left the CPF for the Stampede did so because they believed in both themselves and that there could be something greater than themselves. A shared purpose, a free protector by which all that is evil could be banished."
  nf_sta.2.a:0 "The Lockhearts were a guiding hand."
  nf_sta.2.b:0 "Who could forget the legacy of the Sundells?"

  nf_sta.3.t:0 "In Two, There is One"
  nf_sta.3.d:0 "Through the dreams of the land and its people, the Lockhearts and the Sundells were united. Two wayward families, one from the west, and another from the east, had been united by hands in marriage. A celebration was to be held at the frontier's finest hosting-- Greystables, the scrapper's city, a home for the wayward and lost in the north. Those rejected from the Safehaven yet with a desire to live free. \n\nThe Lockhearts were nobility to those on the frontier. It was their family that once drove the CPF back northwest, and whose results now led to the Iron Lines along our western borders. \n\nThe Sundells were from shadowed woods, and lived a troubled past. Through the frontier they aspired to overcome it, becoming paragons to the unfortunate and downtrodden. \n\nThrough these two families, rural Alberta and Saskatchewan found providence. Through them, they would secure a future."
  nf_sta.3.a:0 "Beauty on the open field."

  nf_sta.4.t:0 "The Lights Came on In Greystables!"
  nf_sta.4.d:0 "Today is a historic day for the people of the Albertan Steppes. Today, in the scrap host of Greystables, power ran a full mile through the electrical lines-- all of it provided by the wonderful new wind turbines outside of the city!"
  nf_sta.4.a:0 "Cooperation brings progression!"

  nf_sta.5.t:0 "Trespassers in Our Borders"
  nf_sta.5.d:0 "Men and women from the Stampede were found in our borders, though they were unable to be caught. It seems they were dealing with some of the old folks from Vermilion..."

  nf_sta.7.t:0 "Rapid Settlement to the North?"
  nf_sta.7.d:0 "Movements detected north-- town designation: external slum. No known worldly references point to it. What are they doing? Why are they gathering on my-- our-- borders? This activity feels old but this activity is new. Who are these people? What are they doing? What are they doing? What are they doing?"
  nf_sta.7.a:0 "STAY AWAY FROM ME!"

  nf_sta.8.t:0 "Attacks in the Northeast!"
  nf_sta.8.d:0 "Bandits in and around the city of Biggar are attacking frontiersfolk-- but more importantly, where did they all come from? \n\nSome of the locals have already taken to dishing out 'frontier justice,' but we've put a pin it for now. We need them alive. This activity is far too organized to be mere coincidence. No doubt at least one of them will talk..."
  nf_sta.8.a:0 "May stars have mercy on the one behind this."

  nf_sta.9.t:0 "Revelations"
  nf_sta.9.d:0 "After days of interrogation, we've found one common thread amongst the raiders harassing travelers in Biggar: men from Stoon with Dandelion pins paid them to do it. Outrage is rapidly growing among Sundells and Lockhearts alike— something must be done!"
  nf_sta.9.a:0 "John Lockheart shall send the letter."
  nf_sta.9.b:0 "Amy-Lee Sundell shall send the letter."

  nf_sta.10.t:0 "News from the Stampede!"
  nf_sta.10.d:0 "TO THE ESTEEMED GENTLEMAN OF THE DANDELION PARTY IN STOON, PIERRE SOLOMON: \n\nIt is with unfortunate tidings that bring my first greetings to you and your fine associates, Mr. Solomon. The unfortunate matters by which my writing refers to of course would be the numerous bandits and highwaymen in and around Biggar which claim to be paid in your coin. \n\nNormally, I like to throw my weight around in more than word, but as I've a wife to keep and a people to leave impressions on, I would like to dignify your sordid actions with the pretense you will more than understand what I mean when I say there will be consequences if this behavior continues. \n\nPlease, take this note with great consideration. If you be an intelligent soul, I expect a letter in return acknowledging my concerns. \n\nWith love, \n\nJohn H. Lockheart"
  nf_sta.10.a:0 "Haha, wow! What a fucking dickhead. Sure, whatever."
  nf_sta.10.b:0 "Bite my ass, curly fries."

  nf_sta.11.t:0 "News from the Stampede!"
  nf_sta.11.d:0 "Mr. Solomon: \n\nWhile I don't imagine you remember me, I have remembered you for a very, very long time. Do you still remember when the moon set over Stoon and the howls of the tribesmen set over the horizon? When men and women with gun and club stormed the streets, letting blood run richly through the drains? \n\nYou took a step too far in sending brigands into our lands. To this, my response is simple: rivers of red are what I offer you. Turn back to your wretched city and forget our people. Utter our name again, invoke our wrath, and you will count yourself lucky if there is even a paste of you left. After all, being a Stooner, you should know that my tribe was taught not to waste a single part. \n\nIf you follow my meaning, send us your left canine so that I may wear it as a trophy, or perhaps a toast, to your failures. If I do not see it soon, then consider us your enemies. You will be dealt exactly what you deserve. \n\nAmy-Lee Sundell"
  nf_sta.11.a:0 "Cute. Here, I got a canine for you..."
  nf_sta.11.b:0 "Yawn. Come and take it, or something."

  nf_sta.12.t:0 "Word from Stoon!"
  nf_sta.12.d:0 "With regards to JOHN LOCKHEART of the THE GREAT STAMPEDE... \n\nI am so sorry about the BANDITS IN BIGGAR. These sorts of issues were promised to be resolved after I took power. It is truly unacceptable that such a thing happened! \n\nI will promise to do better in the future. However, it is only with your support and conviction that I can truly deal with the BANDITS IN BIGGAR. \n\nThank you for writing me. \n\nYours always, \n\nPierre Solomon"

  nf_sta.13.a:0 "That fake son of a bitch..."

  nf_sta.14.t:0 "The Broadcast..."
  nf_sta.14.d:0 "Today, whilst out on the frontier, some of the men heard of a signal out near the Electorals. Something about a 'General Freedom...' Provided with the report was a recording of his broadcast. \n\n"--mutants like you and me are being EXPERIMENTED ON by CRAZY DOCTORS who are using DOCTOR TOBOGGAN to turn Nightkin like us into livestock. It's INHUMANE! It's downright UNAMERICAN, Jack-- and I won't stand for it. Pierre, you bastard, your entire operation is gonna go down, one way or another!" \n\nThe convenience of such a character was not lost on The Couple..."
  nf_sta.14.a:0 "What if we reached out to this 'General Freedom'?"

  nf_sta.15.t:0 "A Meeting at Night"
  nf_sta.15.d:0 "As Pierre Solomon slept soundly in his high tower, General Freedom's bunker was set upon by men with rodeo get-ups and weary frontier smiles on their faces. They came with an offer he couldn't refuse."
  nf_sta.15.a:0 "He took it. Pierre had to go down."

  nf_sta.17.a:0 "Honorable, but disappointing."

  nf_sta.18.t:0 "Silence from Stoon"
  nf_sta.18.d:0 "A month without word from Stoon. Our couriers assured us that our message was received, and that Pierre gave his own acknowledgments. They aren't the sort to lie, either. \n\nPierre has just made a terrible, terrible enemy..."
  nf_sta.18.a:0 "So he deserves to suffer."

  nf_sta.19.t:0 "Just yesterday, an explosion rattled across the sky above Kindersley-- slamming down something fierce down on the ground and devastating a Lockheart farm. Then another. Then another... \n\nThey came from across the Saskatchewan... In Safehaven. Someone's not playing nice."
  nf_sta.19.a:0 "We can take a hint."

  nf_sta.20.t:0 "They Called Him O'Mulligan"

  nf_sta.21.t:0 "The Men From Out West Come Marching Home"
  nf_sta.21.d:0 "With warm tidings from John Lockheart and Amy-Lee Sundell of the Great Stampede, those men and women who once sailed with the royal navy and defended our great waters from foes abound, once thought lost beyond the Electorate, have finally come marching home with the help of the Stampede's men."
  nf_sta.21.a:0 "We will send our regards."

  nf_sta.22.t:0 "The Kingsley Republic, and What Remains"
  nf_sta.22.d:0 "From the ever-glowing ashes of the CPF came the Kingsley Republic, a covenant forged by merchants under a false 'Queen' that spat in the face of the Manitoban hierachy. Still, the merchants retained the true heart of this 'republic,' and while it started with some degree of honesty, so too did it fall into the darkened vices of greed and pride. With the CPF pushed back, they took to centralizing a people who could not be centralized, and so came the Cab Vultures. Truck-obsessed tribal raiders who craved not for order but a toxic sort of freedom, the sort that allowed them to do whatever they wanted whenever. \n\nThrough two families, this all changed. The Lockhearts were to the west and were, in spirit and in name, the heart of the Steppes, and their word was more than enough to challenge the law. From the east, travelers and wayward souls from Stoon, were the Sundells-- tribesfolk that could no longer tolerate the growing presence of the Dandelion Society. \n\nCaught between the Lockhearts, Sundells, and the Cab Vultures, the city of Kingsley could not stand. As it fell, so too did the ashes of its Republic-- and while the Vultures were pushed back north to crumble under their own weight, the families found immediate comfort in one another."
  nf_sta.22.a:0 "The power of true love could never be understated."
  nf_sta.22.b:0 "The Cab Vulture motor-shamans left a great amount of chems behind."
  nf_sta.22.c:0 "The men in Kingsley knew a winning side when they saw it."

  nf_sta.23.t:0 "The Lockhearts"
  nf_sta.23.d:0 "The Lockhearts have always been a loose collection of nomads and farmers, all united into one greater 'family.' It used to be one of the quickest ways to tell if someone was out to get you or not was to check and see if they responded to the name, and if they did, you became friends in an instant. It was synonymous with ally to those with good intentions, and frontier justice for those without. \n\nJohn Lockheart himself became the figurehead through a series of trials against various foes: The Byemoor Bandits, the Cab Vultures, the Kingsley Republic-- all the same to him, and all fell by his hand equal in fair combat. The art of the duel had been repopularized in the wastes by him, thanks in no short to that sort of romantic rapier-wielding swagger that only a man with the right sort of smirk could carry. In the end, it was this swagger that led him to Amy-Lee Sundell, and it was that same swagger once again that led her to swoon in his arms."
  nf_sta.23.a:0 "He had a lock on her heart."

  nf_sta.24.t:0 "The Sundells"
  nf_sta.24.d:0 "The Sundells history began in Saskatoon-- where they once feasted on the flesh of their fellow men. Whilst they had been pushed out into the countryside, Amy-Lee and many of her family members felt that her tribesfolk had lost much in favor of nothing. They ate other humans, and while it was out of sheer necessity, it beleaguered her to no end. For if something could think, if something could talk and be loved, then what good was there to be found in ending its life for food? Though they were few and far between in the wasteland, she always believed in agriculture-- fruits, vegetables, all could be nurtured into food free of pain. Still, her tribe was nothing if not warriors, and when they marched outward into the fall of the Kingsley Republic, they quickly fell into meeting the Lockhearts, and the rest was history. \n\nIn the end, she craved more than the flesh of her fellow man-- she craved their warmth."
  nf_sta.24.a:0 "Makes you want to eat your heart out..."

  nf_sta.25.t:0 "The Duel"
  nf_sta.25.d:0 "To the states who hold allegiance to the Electorate: \n\nWe are men and women of wisened tongue, but we hold no words left for you and your kind. To this end, we issue the duel: if you so desire to bring pain, then we shall issue you some greater. You have one month, and then we march upon your den of inequity. Your people would do well to flee, and we will not fight a people unreadied. \n\nMay the best of us win."
  nf_sta.25.a:0 "The giant turns its face..."

  nf_sta.26.t:0 "War Comes On Swiftly"

While we cannot say we that share the same philosophies as you, we have nothing but endless respect for you and the neverending quest for freedom. To this end, we would like to offer some of our own manufactories to help secure you and your newly-freed peoples some extra assistance in the midst of this chaos. \n\nIn the meantime, we offer you a simple hearty "thank you" and a salute of the mind. \n\nFare thee well!"

There are many who would seek to take from us both our hard earned prosperity.

  nf_sta.34.d:0 "One thing both John and Amy never expected after having their child, was how much they'd consider sleep a luxury. Joy demanded more attention than every collective within the Great Stampede combined but the two wouldn’t have it any other way. It was extremely late into the night when Joy had been put to sleep, sleeping peacefully after her meal and a cuddle session with her parents. John and Amy both let out a huge sigh as they entered their bedroom, collapsing on their bed without even removing their clothes. That could come tomorrow, for now, they desired the comfort of each other and their bedding. John slept soundly, snoring softly, one of his hands laying across Amy's stomach protectively. Amy, however, couldn’t sleep a wink. Anxiety gnawed at her stomach and she could not figure out why. Tossing and turning or punching the pillow, try as she might, she could not fall asleep. After two and a half hours of attempts, she rose. A glass of water would fix this perhaps. Creeping out of the bed quietly so as to not wake up her love, she made her way towards the kitchen. Passing Joy’s room, she stopped and stood just outside her door. The room was quiet, almost eerily so. She worried for her child, it was her job as a mother. But this felt different like her gut knew something she didn’t. She slowly opened the door, peeking inside to check on her infant daughter. ‘“Joy” She mumbled. \n\nHer blood went cold. Standing on the windowsill, perched to leap out was a figure covered in all black, softly holding Joy within their arms. They looked towards Amy before quickly leaping out, the darkness covering their escape."

  nf_sta.40.d:0 "Amy never knew a human could physically cry as much as she had lately. Everywhere she went, everything she did, and everyone she saw, she cried. It was her prime emotion and when she tired of crying, she opted to get mad instead. Anger and sadness were all she knew. Sadness for her child, and anger towards the sick person who took them away. John cried too, though he kept it secret, Only crying when the two of them were alone and could take comfort in each other's arms. They kept each other strong, their love being the only thing that kept them going, giving them hope that one day they would see their baby again. Another sleepless night had occurred, with Amy getting up at the crack of dawn. She looked at herself in the mirror, dark bags underneath her eyes. Her expression was dark, she couldn't remember the last time she had smiled. She looked down at the sink and began to splash some water onto her face. When she looked back up, a large figure stood before her. So numb from depression, she didn't even do anything for the first second, simply staring at the figure in the mirror until her self-preservation kicked in and she moved to scream. Before any sound could escape her mouth, the figure grabbed her head, their gloved hand covering her mouth. Amy reacted quickly, kicking their knee, causing them to release their grip on Amy. She then rushed towards the person, ready to tackle them to the ground. The sight of their gun brought Amy to a standstill, freezing up. \n\n”You wanna see your kid? Stop squirming around” They said quietly. Amy froze, her eyes widening in shock. “Good. Listen here. If you want to see your kid, you come to this area marked on this letter. You get here at 22:00 and bring nobody but you and your husband. I’ll bring the kid. If not, you’re never seeing them again. I’m going to leave now, if you scream I'll kill you, your husband, and your kid. Got that?” They said. Amy nodded, tears streaming out of her face. \n\n”Good. See you then Miss Sundell”."

  nf_sta.41.d:0 "It had been extremely difficult convincing their guards to let Amy and John go out to the letter's location, with the guards nearly begging to come along, but eventually, Amy and John convinced them, assuring them that they could handle anything they came across. The two of them were extremely nervous, caught between the desperation of wanting to see their child again and the expectations of a trap, it had been exhausting debating whether the two should go along with the Warden’s game. The night before, the two of them had not slept a wink. Their anxiety ate into them until the sun began to softly rise. They embraced each other once before setting out, praying that they may see their baby girl. \n\nAmy and John slowly trekked through the wasteland early in the morning. They both carried weapons and had ditched their royal clothing for light leather armor. They were both on edge, constantly surveying the area for any clues that would display a trap being set for them. That was until they heard the distant cries of a baby. As if a switch was flipped for both of them, caution went out the window as they both charged forward as fast as they could towards the source of the cries. The cries were originating from a small baby pram that lay still within the rocky canyon they moved through. Nothing surrounded it, no notes or signs. \n\nElation surged within the two as they reached the pram, tucked neatly and comfortably was Joy, crying loudly. Amy and John soon followed, tears streaming down their faces as they picked up their child and embraced them. What struck them both as odd, was the fact that Joy was well-groomed. Her face had been washed, and the sheets she was kept in were quite well-kept. Had the Safehaven crooks taken good care of Joy? It didn’t matter to them, they had her back and they would never be taken apart again."

The Lockhearts and Sundell’s support them no matter the situation. Love had won out over the evils of the wasteland. United until the very end."
