 EDA_DIRECTOR_COLE_NAME: "Director Cole"
 EDA_LEADER_DESC: "Director Cole has always been a brilliant investigator - Top of his class at the Roswell ILEA, veteran of multiple deep cover investigations in foreign lands, and the first to solve the murder of the previous director at the hands of one of the Legion's Frumentarii that had done the impossible and infiltrated the Blue Rose Society. He was the obvious choice for the next Director of the Society - and if all goes according to his plans - all of New Mexico."

 eda_origin:0 "Blue Rose of New Mexico"
 eda_origin_desc:0 "The Blue Rose Society has been in New Mexico since the bombs dropped, continuing a mission so important that even the end of the world could not sway them from their mission. But what is it we've been doing?"
 eda_pallus:0 "The Wrath Of Paullus"
 eda_pallus_desc:0 "The Blue Rose Society was able to survive the onslaught of the warlord Paullus and his Cohort, but we still dread the day the Legion returns to New Mexico..."
 eda_lanius:0 "Lanius Approaches"
 eda_lanius_desc:0 "And now, the time has come. Lanius, a new Legate has been sent to conquer New Mexico for the distant "Caesar". The Lambda Tribe have already been defeated, and it looks like we're next..."
 eda_spies:0 "Legacy Of The DIA"
 eda_spies_desc:0 "While many are aware of the obvious connections between the FBI and the Blue Rose Society's origins, fewer know of the influence of the original DIA, who had a few agents sent to help work on the project before the war. They left several Black Boxes scattered around the area hiding emergency equipment, and more importantly, instructions on what to do in case of foreign invasion. Perhaps its time to crack open their caches."
 eda_stealth:0 "Stealth Technology"
 eda_stealth_desc:0 "Stealth Boys in the hands of other nations are useful tools for a getaway, maybe a quick infiltration behind enemy lines. But we've continued studying and refining the technology for centuries, learning how to cloak objects, vehicles, even entire buildings with stealth field generators. Using them to flagrantly could tip off our opponents, but our covert operatives know how to use them to fantastic effect."
 eda_infiltrators:0 "Expert Infiltrators"
 eda_infiltrators_desc:0 "Going behind enemy lines takes more than just survival skills, it also takes social skills. Our special agents will be ready to seamlessly integrate themselves into civilian communities from the moment they reach their destination, able to evade detection and operate behind enemy lines for as long as we need them to."
 eda_FBI:0 "FBI Surveillance"
 eda_FBI_desc:0 "The DIA was certainly impressive, but the FBI was no stranger to dealing with enemy forces. Armed militias, criminal syndicates, and revolting mobs all pushed them to further extremes before the war. Roswell is only the hub for a regional surveillance network, half of which is still functioning. Behind any phone could be a tap, inside any streetlamp could be a camera, within every conveniently intact radio a signal interceptor. Nobody hides from the FBI."
 eda_rebellion:0 "Invisible Rebellion"
 eda_rebellion_desc:0 "Through every secret passage and hidden alcove our agents spread, inciting the people of our land into rebellion and resistance. Weapons appear from nowhere, armed slave revolts become the norm instead of an exception, and entire squads vanish in the night. We will show the world that the Blue Rose Society cannot be controlled, they will have to kill us to the last - and even then we'll leave them some surprises just in case..."
 eda_survivors:0 "The Survivors of New Mexico"
 eda_survivors_desc:0 "Lanius has been routed, and New Mexico is ours for the taking! It wasn't a likely victory, and it may not have even been ours, but we're alive and that's what's important."
 eda_summers:0 "Reclaim Fort Summers"
 eda_summers_desc:0 "The Summers Federation has long squated on technology they barely understand, selling off valuable technology from New Mexico to outsiders. We've tried to invite them to join us several times in the past, that we might work together in rebuilding the state, but been rebuffed each time. If they won't listen to reaon, maybe it's time for force."
 eda_santa_fe:0 "Separation Of Church And State"
 eda_santa_fe_desc:0 "We never really opposed the Archdiocese mission, in fact their preservation of old world lore and culture has proven quite useful in our investigations historically. But we have a duty to enforce the law, and letting a theocracy operate uncontested in New Mexico is something we can't tolerate any longer. Time to issue an ultimatum."
 eda_mescalero:0 "Restoring Order In The Pass"
 eda_mescalero_desc:0 "The relationship between the state and the natives of New Mexico have always been... shaky, to say the least. Pushing into Mescalero territory likely won't help matters, but it's necessary to pull the state back together to prepare for the Legion. We'll give them a chance to do this the easy way, but our hopes aren't high."
 eda_executives:0 "Executive Overrun"
 eda_executives_desc:0 "It might not be as immediately obvious to some, but the Blue Rose Society owes a large amount of its membership to a Vault-Tec Vault. Of course, it didn't take us long to discover their little "experiments". It's time to get rid of the last vestige of Vault-Tec leadership in the wasteland."
 eda_solar:0 "Desert Solar Plants"
 eda_solar_desc:0 "The Deserts of New Mexico were never particularly useful for large scale farming, but they do get regular sunshine for most of the year. Adding a few solar plants to harvest the suns rays couldn't hurt!"
 eda_bus:0 "Oh Right, The Bus Factory"
 eda_bus_desc:0 "Being able to make our own buses sure could come in handy. Maybe we should have been doing this earlier?"
 eda_bombs:0 "Roswell Aerospace"
 eda_bombs_desc:0 "Combining a basic motor industry, the military records and old schematics preserved by the Archdiocese, and the extra hardware left in Fort Summers, we've been able to jump-start actual aersopace manufacturing in New Mexico!"
 eda_sundog:0 "Dog Eat (Sun) Dog World"
 eda_sundog_desc:0 "The Sun Dogs were, admittedly, essential in fending of Centurion Paullus in his initial invasion, and their territory spans more than just the tiny chunks of New Mexico the occupy, but defeating them is still important to uniting the state, and we've been getting strange readings from the area that our scientists want to investigate."
 eda_vault_4:0 "Legacy of Vault 47"
 eda_vault_4_desc:0 "Most people don't know this, but the reason we use Vault-Tec technology is because there is an old Vault under Roswell, still used by a sect of our population that can't shake the feeling that we are not alone..."
 eda_vault_armor:0 "Vault-Tec Power Armor"
 eda_vault_armor_desc:0 "With the Executives defeated, we can finally use what's left of their power armor schematics to start making our own Vault-Tec power armor - with some improvements thanks to the "Alien" technology from Vault 47"
 eda_colorado:0 "What About Colorado?"
 eda_colorado_desc:0 "Colorado is one of the only states bordering New Mexico to not be (completely) overrun with wannabe romans or super mutant armies. Maybe we should look their for allies to deal with the Legion?"
 eda_alien_weapons:0 "Exotic Weaponry"
 eda_alien_weapons_desc:0 "For all their obsessiveness, the researchers of Vault 47 have proven themselves more than capable of designing all manner of new weapons to destroy the "Zetans" they fear, based on reverse-engineering the strange prototypes stored in the Vault."
 eda_experimental_weapons:0 "Experimental Weapons Program"
 eda_experimental_weapons_desc:0 "The weapons of Vault 47 might be nice to give to our general forces, but our use of White Sands over the years has infected us with a certain fondness for explosive weaponry - something we share with the new recruits from Fort Summers. Combining their years of experience and our better research faciilities, who knows what wonders we could develop..."
 eda_satellites:0 "Launch Satellites"
 eda_satellites_desc:0 "Yes, Launch! We might only be able to get smaller objects into orbit but the range of the rockets at the test site is truly staggering, and before long we'll have a small network of our own Military satellites to coordinate forces - and spy on our enemies."
 eda_new_mexico:0 "Liberate New Mexico"
 eda_new_mexico_desc:0 "We're finally ready, armed to the teeth, protected with thick armor, and with eyes - and planes - in the sky. It's time to kick the Legion out of New Mexico once and for all!"
 eda_texas_dollar:0 "Adopt The Texas Dollar"
 eda_texas_dollar_desc:0 "Bottle Caps are... well they're not exactly a great long term currency. While tying ourselves to a foreign currency could be regarded as rendering ourselves weak to foreign influence, working with the biggest non-Legion power in the region could help gurantee our safety in the east so we can focus our full attention on the west, while enabling us to fund a bigger army."
 eda_paranormal_research:0 "Extra-Normal Research"
 eda_paranormal_research_desc:0 "It's not exactly secret that the Blue Rose Society has always been involved in strange, potentially dangerous research. Countless rumors about human experiments, contact with the stars, and cosmic discoveries are whispered in the quiet corners of Roswell. The truth is we investigate every lead we can, but most of them lead nowhere. Still, now that we've expanded our land, we have quite a few new rumors to follow..."
 eda_teu:0 "Join The Texan Economic Union?"
 eda_teu_desc:0 "Denver is lost, overrun with wild dogs and savage tribals. Cheyenne Mountain was cleared out years ago. Boulder Dome is in full lockdown and won't respond. Colorado is a lost cause. Texas on the other hand has been growing into a stable nation-state, taming the wastes and building a halfway functioning society. Maybe we should reach out for an alliance..."
 eda_secrets:0 "The Conspiracy"
 eda_secrets_desc:0 "For 200 years we have watched over this city. But why? All of this and still no answer to why we were here? But the answer's been right in front of us all along..."
 eda_reservation:0 "Secrets Of Los Alamos"
 eda_reservation_desc:0 "The horrors that fill these halls will take ages to dismantle and understand. Still, the original purpose of Los Alamos was being conducted by these twisted ghouls - and the nuclear warheads they were developing for their superweapon could prove useful to us still, albeit on a smaller scale..."
 eda_ciphers:0 "Invite The Ciphers Home"
 eda_ciphers_desc:0 "The Ciphers of Mesa Verde have long wanted to commit a pilgrimage to their ancestral home in Los Alamos, but been denied by the hostile ghouls of the Reservation. With them out of the way, perhaps these enigmatic thinkers would be willing to visit and discuss the finer points of cryptography?"
 eda_who:0 "Who?"
 eda_who_desc:0 "Wait a second, something's not right here. The readings in Blacksun are insane. What happened here?"
 eda_navajo:0 "Learning From The Navajo"
 eda_navajo_desc:0 "To say the Navajo aren't happy to be back under Federal rule would be an understatement, and most of them have proven resistant to the new administration. A few, however, have been wise enough to see the changing winds and are ready to work with our agents, training them to survive the dangers of the Wasteland."
 eda_lambda:0 "Los Alamos East"
 eda_lambda_desc:0 "Los Alamos East has long been regarded as a great mystery of the region. Once a major research facility, the place was reduced to a smoldering ruin months after the Great War had already ended. Perhaps finding the answer to this mystery will help our investigations?"
 eda_rocket_launch:0 "(Un)-Manned Missions To Space!"
 eda_rocket_launch_desc:0 "The Rockets we've been firing so far have been... shall we say "Improvised", using ICBMs as a basis to deploy improvised satellites and probes into space. Now, by combining ancient data provided by the Ciphers and the atomic propulsion systems worked on in the Reservation we can finally design and launch real, purpose built manned rockets from White Sands... with robots and a few mutant animals on board just to make sure it's safe first."
 eda_secret_mission:0 "Preparing For Our Mission"
 eda_secret_mission_desc:0 "To protect the Earth we must first protect the skies. Our Monoplanes are nice, but it's simply not enough - we're going to need Jets to take down Zetan Saucers!"
 eda_sleepers:0 "A Deal With The Sleepers"
 eda_sleepers_desc:0 "The Sleepers are a strange bunch, dangerous and mad some say, but they also sit on a hoard of advanced technologies from all accross the southwest - and beyond. We need copies of the spatio-temporal locater prototypes from the B.O.M.B. 2 space station, and luckily we happen to have some of the wreckage of B.O.M.B. 1 that they want in our territory. Lets make a deal."
 eda_moon:0 "Among The Stars"
 eda_moon_desc:0 "This is it! We've cleared the skies, prepared a rocket, and designed teleporters to setup once we arrive. We're going back to the Moon, and no creature, terrestrial or otherwise is going to stop us."

 nf_eda.1.d:0 ""Centuries ago, before nuclear hellfire scorched the deserts of New Mexico, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was tasked on a mission to Roswell so important, that even the apocalypse could not break their dedication. Their descendents would carry on their mission in secret, while using the extensive assets assigned and working with local law enforcement to keep order in their own little slice of New Mexico, at least for a time. It was their sacrifice and hard labor that preserved a fragment of the old world's glory for us, that we rely on still to this day. Thankfully they were wise, and protected...""

 nf_eda.2.t:0 "The Wrath of Centurion Paullus"
 nf_eda.2.d:0 """Centurion Paullus" is a name spoken of accross Arizona in hushed tones, with scorn and hatred. A butcher and lunatic who raided, enslaved, and stole everything he could from the region with the backing of the "Legion" to the west, then left as soon as he came on a warpath towards Mexico. The Blue Rose Society, as we had begun calling ourself to obscure our old world origins, protected Roswell and White Sands with experimental rocket weapons, but were not able to protect the stretch between them our outlying settlements, which suffered heavy damage and casualties. Even our prior Director was assassinated when a Frumentarii managed to successfully infiltrate our Society for the first time in its history. While stories tell of his loss in Gloria, the Legion itself was not destroyed, and people still fear whatever monster they may send next...""
 nf_eda.2.a:0 ""But Luckily, I have a plan""
 nf_eda.3.t:0 "The Monster Approaches"
 nf_eda.3.d:0 ""And now, the reprisal we've dreaded has come. Legate Lanius, a warrior from the west has been sent with a new Cohort of warriors, this time not to pass through New Mexico but to conquer it - fully and thoroughly. The Lambda Tribe that had long been good neighbors have been almost totally wiped out, enslaved and conscripted to the new army. We were able to recieve a few of their members, but it's become abundantly clear by Lanius's troop movements that we're next on the chopping block...""
 nf_eda.3.a:0 ""We may lose the countryside, Roswell will never fall!""
 nf_eda.4.t:0 "We're Alive?"
 nf_eda.4.d:0 "Cole breathed a sigh of relief as he watched the last Legionaries in Albuquerque rounded up and taken in for questioning. Against all odds, the Blue Rose Society has survived the onslaught of Legate Lanius. With the Legion kicked out of New Mexico for a second time, their invincible reputation was starting to crumble under the their failures. The Director had always maintained his composure, but even he wasn't sure if they would be able to actually get rid of them once and for all. Even now they still held only half the city - the other half filled to the brim with Legion soldiers itching for a fight. But they were ordered by Caesar not to help Lanius or his men if they should fail, and Caesar's word was law. The Society could never hope to return to their original mission while the Legion still occupied half the state - they needed to be removed. But the society had struggled to depose Lanius, if they were going to kill Caesar they would need the help of all of New Mexico..."
 nf_eda.4.a:0 "Whether it wanted to, or not"
 nf_eda.5.t:0 "Help from the new WARDEN"
 nf_eda.5.d:0 "WARDEN, the police administrative AI from Denver somehow accomplished what the Society could not, and defeated Legate Lanius. While it was embarassing for the FBI to be shown up by State Police, WARDEN decided to grace them with a second chance to administer New Mexico. It would to take a while to fully deprogram the legionaries and hunt down any other surviving Federal Officers that were enslaved, but Director Cole knew this battle wasn't over. The Blue Rose Society would have its revenge on the Legion."
 nf_eda.5.a:0 "And now, WARDEN would be here to help..."
 nf_eda.6.t:0 "Legacy of Vault 47"
 nf_eda.6.d:0 "Vault 47, one of the first 50 Vaults built, has long been a cornerstone of Roswell, but its effects on the local culture cannot be understated. One of what we would come to deem the "Experimental Vaults", the Vault was set up to reveal to its inhabitants a great truth of the universe - that we are not alone. As soon as the door was sealed, a meeting of the residents had the overseer reveal to the population that there existed a hostile alien force that had been planning to invade the planet, and Vault-Tec was secretly part of a plan to prepare for mankind's survival should they invade the Earth. The experiment intended to study the potential response to First Contact in a population, and the illusion was sold by presenting "Alien" artifacts - strange weapons, jars of bizzare squids and worms, and recordings of garbled signals. After the initial panic subsided, the dwellers began to re-organize themselves with the drive to protect humanity, forming the so-called "Earth Defense Association" and preparing every dweller to serve as a potential soldier in a war on space. Curiosity flourished in Vault 47 as people developed exciting new countermeasures against the so-called "Zetans" and studied the technology samples provided, preparing for the day the Vault would open and they would retake the Earth from the invaders.\n\nBut when it did, they were sorely disappointed.\n\nThe outside world had fallen only to nuclear hellfire, with no evidence of an alien invasion in sight. The Blue Rose Society recieved them and attempted to integrate the population into Roswell proper, explaining that they had investigated Vault-Tec and discovered the countless experiments conducted on the inhabitants, and the "Zetans" were likely nothing more than a hoax by Vault-Tec to study them. Most of the Earth Defense Association resigned to civilian life, angry at the deception, but some refused to accept this claim. The technology was too advanced, the organic samples too divergent even for human genetic engineering. Despite the Society's best efforts to dissuade them, they still believe the Zetans are out there, plotting our destruction, some day..."
 nf_eda.6.a:0 ""I know the truth is out there...""
 nf_eda.7.t:0 "Checking in on Colorado"
 nf_eda.7.d:0 "With the Sun Dogs defeated, the Blue Rose Society had control of the entire old border with Colorado, and a sizable chunk of the state itself. Already running an entire state started to put a strain on the administration, and until it could catch up plans for a Federal reunion were still far off pipe dreams. Directer Cole pondered, if there was someone else in Colorado who could keep an eye on it, it might prove beneficial to make friends in the region and secure the northern flank... Or perhaps it was best just to let them fight among themselves?"
 nf_eda.7.a:0 ""Colorado is none of our concern.""
 nf_eda.7.b:0 ""Perhaps we could ask the WARDEN program for help?""
 nf_eda.7.c:0 ""WARDEN has this covered, let's just focus on the rest of New Mexico""
 nf_eda.8.t:0 "The FBI reaches out?"
 nf_eda.8.d:0 ""The Federal Bureau of Investigation is alive and well! It seems at least some Federal agents have been doing their job, keeping order in New Mexico while everything went to hell up here. They're offering to transfer control of part of Colorado they've been keeping an eye on in exchange for joining my Defense Network, for mutual safety and democracy.""
 nf_eda.8.a:0 ""How could I say no to that?""
 nf_eda.9.t:0 "The Black Sun Of Colorado"
 nf_eda.9.d:0 "When the expedition investigated the strange readings around Black Sun, they weren't sure what we were expecting to find. Rogue Robots? Crashed Satellites? Real Aliens? What they found defied all expectations. There was evidence, however scant, of a tribe of people, known as the Black Suns, who once lived in the area, but seemingly vanished - all at once. A few bones, a journal or two, and a tattered flag, little to understand about their culture was left. The locals couldn't provide any explanation of having ever seen or interacted with this tribe, only knowing the name. The researchers wondered if the name was of a pre-war origin, perhaps inspired by some unsavory ancient groups, until their instruments nearly exploded from a surge of activity. Above them the sky darkened, almost blotted out around a floating singularity - a "black sun" - more aptly known as a Black Hole. Just as soon as it appeared it vanished, and the team was finally able to determine what it was they had been detecting from the area - Chronotrons. More alarmingly the surge allowed them to detect another, far larger source of the particles in the east, centered in Kansas. While the occurence didn't appear to be a danger right now, the question of why this was happening has sparked every scientist in the Society into action to find an answer. What did it mean?"
 nf_eda.9.a:0 ""And what the hell are they doing in Kansas?""
 nf_eda.10.t:0 "Los Alamos East"
 nf_eda.10.d:0 "Los Alamos East - one of the largest pre-war research faciilities, and now a smoldering radioactive ruin. The investigation became just as much archeology as forensics, with only trace pre-war maps guiding where to dig and seek collapsed tunnels and laboratories under the facility. It became immediately obvious to the investigators that the facility was destroyed in a nuclear detonation, but deeper analysis by explosives experts from Fort Summers concluded that it was not a late Chinese missile - the facility was destroyed by a detonation from within, and deliberately made totally uninhabitable. Deeper digs found a few intact terminals that provided records of a few of the expermiments Los Alamos East was working on - including Teleportation!\n\n    Seemingly locked in an arms race with the CIT and the Big Mountain Company, Los Alamos East had been experimenting with using interdimensonal relay points as a shortcut to be the first to achieve teleportation and win a massive grant from the government. The Great War came before they could finish perfecting the technology's navigation system, and the facility soon found itself cut off from the resources it needed to sustain its operations. There were only chaotic fragments and broken recordings from after the war before the facility's nuclear reactor began to melt down, for unknown reasons. The excavations managed to salvage some of the data on how to build teleporters, but vital pieces were missing..."
 nf_eda.10.a:0 ""Maybe Los Alamos West has the answers?""
 nf_eda.11.t:0 "Our True Purpose"
 nf_eda.11.d:0 "Was it ever in question, really? Director Cole always felt he knew deep down what this was about. Even before the war, Roswell was a hub of jokes and myths, urban legends about a flying saucer crashed in the desert. Of course at the time they were wrong, it really was nothing more than a harmless weather baloon. But the media spun it and people repeated the lie until the city started to draw the obsessive and the strange, all to see if there was some truth to the idea that Aliens had come to visit. And eventually... they did.\n\n   The FBI never could determine how long they had been here, watching us, but the Zetans were quite real, and watching us from the void of space. Scout craft would visit and abduct people and things of interest, only to eventually dump what they did not need back to the planet. Our first run-ins with them were brief, skirmishes here and there, then a saucer shot down, and then more. It became clear they were ready to fight a war, and humanity needed to fight back, in secret. Roswell was the perfect cover for their operations, a place that had long since turned aliens into a saccharine joke. The populace loved the "Men In Black" running about the town constantly checking on things, it was all part of the act to them. But deep down we knew. We always knew.\n\n    When the Great War came it was clear the Society would need to focus on the earth for a while, and protect what little it had left. Vault 47 threw a wrench into the plan by revealing the truth to civilians, but in time that fire was quelled, and the truest believers became a resource, fanatical soldiers ready to join the mission once the time came. And now, with the Legion destroyed and New Mexico secured, the time had come. Cole would finish the job they had started centuries ago and make sure every planetoid in this solar system was 100% Earth controlled."
 nf_eda.11.a:0 ""It's time to return to the Stars, Agents.""
 nf_eda.12.t:0 "Among The Stars"
 nf_eda.12.d:0 "Cole never liked public speaking, preferring to remain as indirect as possible while administering the Society, rarely showing up in person. But this, this was a special occasion, one of the only times he would make an appearance, and for good reason. He took to the podium where the entire city of Roswell could see, and began his address\n\n "When Lanius came baring down, nobody believed it was possible for the Society to survive. And yet, despite all odds, we did, rebuilding Roswell and our mission, until finally, White Sands launched a single rocket to the stars. Over 300 years after the first trip, mankind has returned to the Moon, this time to establish a permanent base. Building even one ship that could make the journey took a herculean effort, and every laborer, engineer, and researcher in our nation should be proud of their part in it. Now that our ship has arrived we can deploy a paired teleporter and achieve easy, almost limitless access to a second celestial body. Building a proper Moon Base could take a while, but Humanity finally has a second home, a second place in the stars to ensure the safety of all mankind!""
 nf_eda.12.a:0 ""Building it will take years... but we've made the first step.""
 nf_eda.13.t:0 "Los Alamos West"
 nf_eda.13.d:0 "The original Los Alamos, whose former employees apparently did not like the moniker Los Alamos West, were reluctant to help with the Blue Rose Society's investigation. Digging through the records nothing was left about what they were working on at their sister lab. But the Archives were incomplete, with many of the original designs lost in the chaos shortly after the Great War. Reviewing the records of other groups in the wider area a realization was made - Perhaps the Ciphers saved a schematic that could help shed light on the projects at Los Alamos East?"
 nf_eda.13.a:0 ""Contact them at once!""
 nf_eda.14.t:0 "Meeting With The Ciphers"
 nf_eda.14.d:0 ""The Ciphers were a strange sort, obsessed with mathematics and formula, having commited the schematics of Los Alamos to memory and carved them into the rocks, the mountains, the very landscape so they could not possibly forget. It took some coaxing to get them to come to Los Alamos, but eventually their curiosity won over and the investigators stationed there were able to have them review the fragments retrieved from Los Alamos East. Eventually they were able connect the designs to some massive geoglyphs that could be used to finish the machine. Before they left they made clear that something was missing from their ancient carving - a formula that would be needed to tune the machine to properly reflect off of nearby dimensions without destroying anything sent through. Even the Ciphers extensive collection of formulas and equations did not have the answer to this formula, nor the exact phenomena by which the machine was expected to transport matter.""

 nf_eda.15.d:0 ""The researcher team assigned to Blacksun were taking another trip to study the anomalous activity near when a terrible idea occured to them - to use the schematics of the prototype teleporter receivers to gather data. When analyzing the results they determined that the Black Hole was connected to another point in spacetime, perhaps deliberately in an attempt to create a wormhole! While they could only gather vague data off the signals garbled from the other end it appeared to be an attempt to transfer matter accross time and space, but too unstable for anything to make it to the other side. While it was absolutely a cause for alarm that someone else out there was experimenting with this technology, the data gathered has helped advance the Society's own understanding of the teleporter technology and artificial wormhole induction! Still, if they didn't want to get their atoms ripped apart by the event horizon they were going to need to find the formula that the the Ciphers were talking about...""

 nf_eda.16.d:0 "The search for the missing cipher seemed to have been reached a dead end. The greatest scientists, cryptographers, and mathematicians of New Mexico, despite their best efforts were still trying to rebuild the foundations of pre-war science, and something as advanced as teleportation seemed just a jump too far.\n\n     But just as they were getting ready to give in - he arrived. The Free Man, spoken in legend as the last surviving Lambda to not be broken by the Legion. Aince the fall of the Navajo he had been busy on a mission finding as many surviving Lambda slaves scattered accross the former Legion territory, and was bringing a band back to their homeland when he heard of the recent investigations, and came to offer up what he knew. For centuries the Lambda had carried on the tradition of memorizing their birthright, massive string of letters, numerals, and other symbols left to them, a massive string of gibberish. The first symbol of this string, the Lambda, would come to be the symbol others knew their tribe by, but all these years later they could not remember where it came from. Any written samples of the sequence were destroyed by Lanius, and the elders who had commited it to memory were made to forget, or dead under the harsh conditions of the Legion. But the last free Lambda, the Free Man was one of the few who has commited the entire sequence to memory, and wrote it for our scientists before leaving to continue his fight elsewhere. The equation was exactly what was needed to build crude teleporters capable of shunting matter from one point to another, albeit with poor precision over longer distances. It might not have been safe to use on humans yet, but the logistics department could think of a few uses for the technology..."
 nf_eda.16.a:0 ""Where did the Lambda Tribe get the sequence anyways?""
 nf_eda.17.t:0 "Explosive Diffusion"
 nf_eda.17.d:0 "Director Cole looked out the window of the FBI office looking out into Roswell, where the war against Lanius continued to rage on. Lanius was no Zetan, but his methods may as well have been as inhuman and as alien as many movies and comic books made them out to be. Nevertheless, Cole covered his head as yet another spear was chucked through the window, the third one today. This could not last. Although Pre-War holidays had never been of true importance to the FBI or the Blue Rose Society, there was something comforting about celebrating the traditional big American holidays each year. With the passing of not one, but two, calendar years, however, that tradition was now a somber memory, replaced with the visages of the dead being thrown into corpse piles, while bullets and screams echoed throughout the desert town. That was why Cole had to make this call. Picking up the receiver of a special hotline telephone once belonging to the Federal Bureau of Control, the Director dialed out the letters to spell "Fort Summers".

In all my years, this dumb chunk of plastic never once worked."\nCole held the receiver out in front of his ear, using his free hand to loudly unseal the clasps of a bright blue suitcase. Putting it back up to his ear, he coldly answered. \n"Who I am to you, Ms. Morrison, is of little concern. I am a representative of your neighbors, the Blue Rose Society, and am asking for your help. I am familiar with you and your group's expertise in weapons of the explosive variety, and need help in going up against the Legate known as-"\n"Lanius, yeah, I getcha. So what's the sitch? Gotta be a catch to this somewhere."\n"The 'sitch', as it were, is that, in exchange for your services of assisting us in taking out Lanius, you may have access to our White Sands territory, as well as our exclusive weaponry obtained there. In your terms... 'Big Booms'. Afterwards, we shall discuss the matter of your group peacefully integrating with ours. If you refuse, then know that we reached out to you, and that Lanius will not hold back his rage. A rage he will use to quickly stomp us out, and one he will only continue to fuel as he rapes, pillages, and if some are unlucky enough, enslaved, by the butcher, until he fulfills his goal of subjugating the East."\nA resounding silence echoed from the other end of the line."

However, he was not met with an immediate pickup, but instead the ringing of a phone, coming from somewhere in the building.\n\nThe momentary confusion explained itself as Ryleigh stuck her head through Cole's office doorframe, holding the wireless telephone she had used before.\n\n"'pologies for the confusion, I decided to come find you myself, no sense in talking to a disembodied voice over the phone. Plus I prefer to see my friends... and foes, it seems, up close and personal."\n\nCole craned his head, reaching under his desk for the bright blue suitcase used during his first communication with the Summers.\n\nMorrison stuck her nose up at the ceiling, looking at the FBI roundel that decorated it.

The children of the other tribes are now slaves, likely barely remembering their own language. Within a generation, perhaps even a few more years... the Western Apache will be gone forever."\n"...Bastard. Is that all you want? To rub in the extinction of our culture?"\n"No. We came to offer you a chance to save it. Alone you have no chance, but with our technology and intel, we might stand a chance to destroy the Legion. Accept our deal and I can gurantee your people's safety, and full Citizenship in New Mexico.

He reached for the phone, slowly lifting it to his face.\n"COLOSSUS?"\n"Yes, Director. I have resumed running on my own hardware, and the auxiliary hardware that WARDEN procured across Colorado. The experience was quite informative.

I am becoming convinced that the war effort may have been sabotaged from within, the highest form of Treason."\nCole held his breath.

As of this moment I am re-founding the Defense Intelligence Agency, and putting you in charge of it - with the accompanying authority to operate accross the entire Denver Defense Network and beyond to find answers to this question.

Some in the nation are proposing we change our name and flag to suit the new status quo, but cannot come to an agreement on how. Most of the citizenry is content with the change simply to "New Mexico", solidifying our continuity of the pre-war government. Other groups, particularly the Mescalero and surviving Pueblo peoples in our borders, believe the state's name never adequately represented the region as anything more than an offshoot of Mexico, and have proposed the State be renamed to "Pueblo", along with a flag derived from Albuqurque. The residents of Vault Four brought their own design and name taken from plates at the bus factory, one they claim combines the state motto with their Vault-Tec heritage.

Caesar was no fool, it was plain to see that this uprising had been planned and supported by an outside force, no doubt the "Blue Rose Society" Lanius had still failed to dispatch. Now over a year into his 5 year mission and still unable to conquer his first target, perhaps Caesar's faith in him had been misplaced. To put down them down would be trivial for the Legion proper, but Caesar stayed his forces and made clear his position. \n\n"If Lanius cannot deal with a simple slave uprising, how could he hope to take Colorado?

Across Roswell the return was celerbrated by all members of the society - except one. Now the one objector, General MacNamara, stood in front of the Box, presenting old military clearance codes and demanding entry. The doors yieled without response from Colossus, and through the base MacNamara walked, knowing his exact path until he stood face to face with the ZAX within.\n\n"What are you.

Now everybody in Roswell is happy, they think when the time comes you're going to save humanity. And I want to believe they're right.

Occupying Colorado was already stretching their numbers thin, and the sporadic patrols were already struggling to keep control over the remaining legionaries.

Regaining his sanity, Lanius looked over at a Pre-War map of the Southwest, modified extensively by Caesar's Frumentarii. The so-called Blue Rose Society were to be proof of his first victims. A weak and small group that couldn't maintain the same levels of even a small Legion child. Perhaps both Lanius and Caesar had underestimated their true potential. Wandering over to his war planning desk, he looked at the circular rock that represented Roswell, and the figurines of his men. He had expected that the chariots would have taken them out. Yet for some reason, the symbolism of the rock representing Roswell stuck out to him. A rock was a symbol of hardiness, stubbornness, resistant to change and time. But even rocks erode, become smaller and worn. Until they became pebbles or turned to dust. It was then that Lanius had an idea. He may not have been able to win using Caesar's ideals of shiny chariots and spotless steel blades. But what if he were to draw out older weapons from the Legion's early days? The guns of the Blackfoot, the poisons of the Kaibabs, the trickeries of the Fredonians.

 EDA_sheriff_decision_desc:0 "Sheriff might seem like a title out of the wild west, but establishing a better hierarchy by encouraging the best FBI Police officers be promoted to the rank of Sheriff. Even if historically their numbers weren't large enough to require the rank, our swelling defense force could benefit from a little hierarchy."

 EDA_marshal_decision_desc:0 "Marshalls were always an arm of the Federal Government, a nation-wide law enforcement agency that predated the FBI itself. Re-instituting this position and giving the Marshalls broad authority across our territory (and beyond so long as they can back it up with their gun) will inspire our people to follow in the legacy of these mythic lawmen."

 EDA_power_suit_decision:0 "Restore Heavy Power Suits"
 EDA_power_suit_decision_desc:0 "Heavy Power Suits were being developed by the US military in New Mexico before the bombs fell, a theoretically extension of Power Armor to an even larger and more powerful battlesuit. The project never went far enough to see use in the field, but by repairing some of the few prototypes we were able to relocate to Roswell before the Great War we may be able to give them a proper field test in the wasteland."
 EDA_power_suit_decision_ii:0 "Lunar Power Suits"
 EDA_power_suit_decision_ii_desc:0 "The Power Suits have surpassed expectations, integrating alongside regular power armor and Federal Police to great effect in fending off anything foolish enough to invade our territory. Still, there's plenty of room for improvement. energy shielding, blaster weaponry, better rockets, better onboard AI for autnomous suits, and a litany of environmental control systems to make them viable for use even in the Vacuum of space could all be added with some effort."

Surely defending Humanity from monsters beyond the stars is as important as defending it from mutants and rogue robots right?"
 EDA_stealth_armor_decision:0 "Finish Stealh Suit Mk III"
 EDA_stealth_armor_decision_desc:0 "The Stealth Suit prototype we retrieved from Big MT has been quite enthusiastic to help us in replicating its technology but we still need a little more development. A strange side-effect of the programming is the demand for a system to synthesize Med-X, with the AI refusing to operate the rest of the systems without it, so we'll need to develop that first. As for the armor itself, incorporating designs for Secert Service armor the DIA had stashed away might work for field agents, but finding a way to replicate the complex polymers with only the materials available in New Mexico may take a while, and will require the full attention of our research team."
 EDA_jetpacks_decision:0 "Finish Jetpacks"
 EDA_jetpacks_decision_desc:0 "Jetpacks would no-doubt give our field agents a level of mobility we could only dream of without them, but the ones we retrieved from  Area 51 have proven... unstable. The Jet Engines required parts we lost the ability to manufacture centuries ago, and their energy consumption makes them impractical to incorporate into our Power Armor at this time. Focusing on Lighter Jetpacks assisted with salvaged Anti-gravity technology could make the difference needed, but it will still take time to build something viable for field use."

 operation_highrise_desc:0 "Records show that some valuable hardware was left at Area 51 before the war. While intel suggests most of it has been torn apart by the local raiders, and the most advanced technology is too deep underground to safely retrieve, MacNamara says there should be a stash of Jetpacks in an old side-hangar under electronic lock. It would be dangerous to drop into a base still crawling with raiders, but we could gain a lot by retrieving them for study."
