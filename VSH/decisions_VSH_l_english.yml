  vsh_cascadian_authority_decision_cat_desc:0 "Seattle was ours years ago. For every street, ten Wardens stood tall on patrol, keeping the peace as was demanded of us. Then, men in power armored suits came out of the Blizzard, and we were forced to retreat. In the chaos, raiders poured in from the coast, carving out whatever they could of Portland for themselves. We were left embarrassed and afraid, running from our territory with our tails tucked between our legs. \n\nSome of us escaped south to join the raiders in Port Maw, hoping to strike a new life amongst liars and thieves. Others ran north, into Bellingham, where ropes now hold them from trees. Us? We fled east, into the hills. We found solace and purpose again in helping the people of Safehaven, but times changed and opportunities arose. We took our numbers and we made our due. \n\nWe're in charge, but we're far from back. Our men have scattered and our command structure never recovered. If we want to call ourselves the protectors of Cascadia again, we'll need to earn it."
