  nf_strath.1.d:0 "The Mexicans, the Filipinos, the Indians, all suffered under the American yoke. But never forget - it was Canada who suffered first, when they burned our capital in 1812. We tried to be friends, serving as comrades in the World Wars, but in the 21st century, their demands for our oil proved too much. To protect 'our security', they occupied our nation. Celebrating it a great victory for democracy, they used power armour and energy weapons on civilians, strip mined our resources, and used us to augment their war machine. \n\nThe bourgeoisie collaborated, convinced the Americans were too strong to oppose - and so resistance fell to to the anti-imperialist progressives of the Canadian Peoples Front. The Yukon Five; the Quebecois Quinze; and the Saskatchewan Six were but some of the cells that struck blows for the great cause! Armed by the Chinese, our guerillas were winning the war before the bombs fell."

In the years that followed, the Canadian People’s Front united much of the north. For a brief period our Mounted Police crossed the eastern stretch towards Manitoba. The dream of reunification was alive and well, the masses would have been liberated from their yoke. Perhaps, in time, we could have even saved the Americans.\n\nBut it was not to be. The death of our beloved Chairman Gerrand allowed cracks to form in our foundations. Division and deviation of thought started to crop up and the great ideals passed down from Chairman Jiang began to grow. Moderates and dissolutional fools alike started to seek ways to piece out the Commune. However, we gained a champion as their roses began to take root."

But still, there is dissent. Some question her motives, and argue for a peaceful approach with the dissenters. There is a word for these people - wreckers.

In this vein, the party has started to cultivate a successor, someone to ensure the legacy of the revolution lives on. In the farmlands of the commune, a man named Antoine Sorel has shown himself to be the pinnacle of revolutionary thought.

At the top of this list, is Sorel himself, the new party champion. The ideological struggle has been cracked open like the skulls of the unlucky officials high on that list. While the Cadets see Teresse as infallible and all-knowing, Teresse doesn’t account for her hubris.\n\nIn the same cold winter air as the Cadets march to deliver their orders, Sorel and the most senior party officials have readied themselves. They have dedicated themselves to the preservation of the revolution be it atomic bombs, American pretenders, or now their own Chairwoman. The might of Redmond may be on her side, but Sorel has a final card he can play.

Three officers and three plans now lay in front of Teresse, each different and unique, but all not born from the great mind of the Chairwoman herself.\n\nThe first brought by Sergeant Kapastarov is centered around creating breakthroughs in the enemies’ line. Select units will be given the best of the best equipment and tasked with identifying and exploiting weak links in the enemy to drive the revolution into their rear. Once in their rear, these units will operate inside enemy territory causing chaos to destroy supply lines and morale. The second plan created by Sergeant Russanova is one commonly seen in the older revolutionary states, that being mass conscription. Stating that the revolution must harness the manpower of our Commune and grind the enemy down with our pure spirit. Lastly, Sergeant Blovoski advocates for a completely unorthodox idea,the introduction of a new tank force.

The dream of Commonwealth liberation was left in her hands.\n\nUpon crossing the border, the Commonwealth Popular Liberation Army settled in the frontier snowlands of the American occupation zone. The army entered with fire in their hearts and ideals in their head, but reality soon gripped the army and even Thao herself. The CPLA was outnumbered twenty to one in raw forces, such the revolution must be cultivated from the ground up. Thao would take the name of the Red River to avoid attention on her command. However, the pressing matter of how to deal with their new home, the Farm took center stage.How would they turn this frontier town into a revolutionary base?"

Day by day, little by little, the army was losing men as Thao was left gripping at frozen wheat stalks. However, the fortunates of the worker's army were saved by the charity of the underground. It was Alexei Soltz, the boss of the Red Deer underground market that reached out hand of worker solidarity. Known as the “Booky”, this once poor Russian man clawed his way from the snow and ice into a  place of power, although it was an illicit one. What became known as the Mountain Pass came into reality, fuelling the once on the brink army.\n\nSoon supplies flooded into the region, not only for the army, but for the wider population of the north. The once constant famine of the north ended through imported drug bought bread filling the bellies of all workers. The popularity of Thao and her dreams soared alongside the trade, being seen as champion of the people of the common worker. However, the times of slow growth and ideology focus would come to an end.\n\nColonel Thao would pace in the farmhouse living room, wondering how their dream of revolution would come to be. It was once again Soltz who birthed the idea that gripped Johnson's nightmares. If the Commonwealth would be free then you must shock the foundations. This is how the bombings came to be. Thao, afraid of the cost it would inflict on the worker, swallowed the bitter pill that it was their only choice. To carry out these new expanded operations, new equipment would be sourced.

Thao uttered one word to her second in command Soltz, “go”. Within minutes every single cell of the CPLA was activated throughout the north, setting the Commonwealth ablaze.\n\nThe fire of revolution was now burning with the fury of all the workers cruelly punished for existing. Soon the chaos was paused by the crackle of the radio, it was Colonel Thao herself.\n\n“People of the inhumane Johnson regime, stand up now with us, your army of liberation! Take up arms and fight your oppressor, show Red Deer that you are human and worthy of liberty and freedom. Wield your hammer, rake, or rolling pin and drive back the Americans from our home!”\n\nThe echo of Thao's words filled the Commonwealth, leading to a mass increase in her numbers. Now the army has to reorganize these troops in order to send the stripped menace back to hell. However, the question is how should this new manpower be organized. Soltz wishes to mass mobilize the troops and send them in waves of human shock and awe. Thao on the other hand wishes to make shock troops to break the enemy lines.

The expansion from a rug tag group of insurgents in the hills to a real entity have led to disputes over how to run things. No longer is the Colonel commanding troops in small cells, but wide swaths of land filled with hungry and homeless civilians.\n\nOut of these suffering civilians is one man, a young farmer who has organized the formations of work schedules leading and productive farms has approached Thao herself. This Antoine Sorel has come to the farmhouse to plead for any sort of governance. He claims the rural communities are a nightmare filled with fire and blood. The shelves are empty and the people are starting to reconsider their allegiance. To prove this reality, Sorel has brought with him pictures, crudely taken, but does confirm his truth.\n\nThao sinking back into her chair pours over the photos, forcing herself to see the reality of the suffering, chipping her dream away. In a fit of rage, the Colonel takes to her feet, throwing the photos into the corner followed by a bottle of water flying through the window. Composing herself, she turns to Sorel who now has recoiled to the doorframe. Holding out her hand, Thao shakes the scared Sorel vowing that a civilian government will be created to ensure these horrors will end.

Thao’s confidence in the bill soared as she was surrounded by her loyal steel mill representatives. However, the representatives from the rural regions sternly blocked the vote, denoting the connotations of Teresse-esque policies.

  nf_cpl.24.a:0 "No more blood."

  nf_cpl.25.t:0 "The Brick Throne"
  nf_cpl.25.d:0 "Congress once again finds itself back into session, the seats of the former Rural Collective filled with new bright-eyed representatives. For her part, Thao commands the floor of Congress like her battalions in the field. Keeping every vote or debate orderly and free from the stagnation that once plagued the government as a whole. First on the agenda is the Congressional Oversight Bill. Congress has been acting as the sole governmental body, using the army as its enforcement apparatus. Thao wishes to shatter this status quo, officially cementing her role as head of Congress and removing any traces of the army from governmental activities.\n\nEach representative cast their vote with the memories of the failed coup still fresh in their minds. Without much shock, the count came back almost unanimous with only three absentee votes in contrast to the majority. Thao now wields her title of Congressional President, relinquishing her title of colonel to ensure the separation of Congress from the army. In the same turn, the army is now under the stranglehold of Congress. Everything from their bullet casings to their orders will now be directed by congressional approval alone."
  nf_cpl.25.a:0 "Another step forward!"

  nf_cpl.26.t:0 "Fulfilling the Empty Promises"
  nf_cpl.26.d:0 "Centuries ago, when America’s war machines crossed the border and turned Canada into a rump state, the never-ending cries for freedom began to ring out. Many have claimed to be the proverbial champion of the oppressed Canadians, even Teresse the tyrant herself claimed it as her own. These promises of freedom and worker’s rights started with the Canadian People’s Front and have been left hollow. Thao and her Congress are the newest in this long line of champions, working tirelessly to realize their common dream. The floor of Congress was soon set to a vote on a Worker’s Bill of Rights.\n\nA document that outlines the liberties of the Canadian people is seen as key to a free Canada by Thao and her loyalists. Some of these milestone rights are free health care, worker pensions, and most importantly freedom of belief. The most fundamental right of belief has been enshrined to avoid any more bloody insurrections. While speech is still monitored to ensure stability, each Canadian is now promised by this bill to have the ability to hold their own unique belief, even if it's only in private. The deliberation was short and the voting was even shorter, the outcome already assured led to early celebrations. As soon as the bill was passed, the citizens joined in on the celebrations. The day would end with the streets filled with citizens and representatives alike, carrying flags and singing patriotic songs."
  nf_cpl.26.a:0 "What had to be done."

  nf_cpl.27.t:0 "The Nuts And Bolts"
  nf_cpl.27.d:0 "The once rubble-filled factories of Redmond have been cleared and their production lines now roar to life. Products have now begun to fill store shelves, clothes fill the racks and even luxuries like stoves are now available. In between congressional sessions, Thao paces the catwalks of these factories. Overseeing the work done by her constituency, reprimanding any harsh or unruly factory manager. The once-feared colonel is now seen handing out bread to the workers right next to the roaring production lines."
  nf_cpl.27.a:0 "Feared? You sure?"

  nf_cpl.28.t:0 "Gesture of Good Faith"
  nf_cpl.28.d:0 "After the freeing of the rural collaborators, Thao has sought to ensure a positive image with her rural constituency. Every month almost like clockwork, Thao and a fleet of trucks make their way deep into the rural back fields of Canada. Farmers from miles around wait patiently for their allotted energy cells or brand-new farming equipment. Fresh out of the factory tractors are the crown jewels of these missions, being given to the most in need farmers. These charitable actions, beyond what is governmentally required, have turned Thao into almost a saint-like figure among the rural populace. The once hotbed of rebellion has been tamed by Thao one tractor at a time."
  nf_cpl.28.a:0 "The price of loyalty."

  nf_cpl.29.t:0 "The Bounds of Freedom"
  nf_cpl.29.d:0 "The question of Canadian citizenship fills the halls of Congress, every debate no matter its origin seemingly devolves to the question of who qualifies as Canadian. The American warlords are now a distant memory, but their impact still looms large over Canada. The Arcadians are seemingly a cultural blend of pre-war Canadian and American culture. Sitting at the heart of the issue, every representative argues whether they qualify for full citizenship and thus benefit from the Worker’s Bill of Rights. Another group in similar standing is the ghouls, feared by the common worker, many representatives have been urged to leave these ghouls to rot.\n\nAs this question rages among the representatives, Thao has taken the debate the same way she would a battle, with cunning subversions. While the most loud and ardent representatives debate on the congressional floor, Thao rallies support in the offices and backrooms. Promising her support or material concessions in turn for support of citizenship for all who reside in Canada. The fiery debate continued right up until the first ballot was cast, the voting was similarly contentious having to be recounted twice. At the day’s end, the vote came out in favor of citizenship for all with the razor-thin majority of a single vote. Soon legislation will be drafted cementing this landmark vote into law."
  nf_cpl.29.a:0 "Are they even Canadian?"

  nf_cpl.30.t:0 "Those Who Haunt The Living"
  nf_cpl.30.d:0 "As expected, once that bill for ghoul’s right to citizenship crossed on the floor, fire and brimstone erupted from every corner. Many argue that they are nothing more than ghosts who haunt the living. The dead that should have been put out of their misery long ago. They sit there in the halls of Congress dedicated to the rights of workers while advocating for their expulsion from land. After an hour of this horrid debate, Thao had enough and slammed her fist down saying,\n\n'Enough! We sit here and we debate and debate the fate of these people’s lives while in the next breath condemn the former party for this very thing. They saw us as nothing more than human machines for their factories. We fought them because we wanted to live in a place free from this vile debate. Now we sit here and do the same? We shall continue to vote, but remember what we fought for.'\n\nThe hall stayed quiet and the vote continued, a secret ballot sent out to ensure no one would be held to their beliefs on such an issue. The counting was swift, three quarters of Congress voted in favor, the rest against. The issue passed and the ghouls were now Canadian citizens."
  nf_cpl.30.a:0 "For Workers! For Canada!"

  nf_cpl.31.t:0 "Our Lost Tribe"
  nf_cpl.31.d:0 "The debate about Arcadians was a fiery one from the start, many especially in Congress viewed them as traitors to the Maple Leaf. Those who left their country behind for the arms of the oppressors. However, their actions after the revolution have started to ease their stone hearts. Attack after attack was done upon the Arcadians, but yet they never tried to strike back, they were always the first workers in and the last out. Thao has made it her mission to ensure their citizenship.\n\nThe vote for their citizenship was a hard one, even with Thao’s Steel Block having a majority, many defected. The vote came down to two final ballots, ending with the smallest majority in congressional history. Those two votes in favor gave the Arcadians their right to citizenship, they were lucky that day."
  nf_cpl.31.a:0 "For Workers! For Canada!"

  nf_cpl.32.t:0 "The Maple Leaf And The Gear"
  nf_cpl.32.d:0 "Ever since the abolishment of the pre-war Canadian government, the great white north had been filled with famine and hardship. The sight of a beggar on every street corner or a starved farmer in the barren fields has been a common sight even under the CPF’s leadership. Teresse used her iron fist to “clean” up the streets, claiming her tough policies of rationing eliminated the plague of famine. In reality, those beggars were relocated to unmarked graves buried next to the starved farmers in those frigid barren fields.\n\nThe once-empty shelves are now starting to be filled, the beggars now find themselves in government shelters, and the farmers now utilize tractors. Thao once dreamt of a government run by the workers, with each industry having a seat at the table. The economy restructured under this guiding principle has now led to a society devoid of economic inequity. The congressional representatives bear the same burden as the worker in the factory or the farmer in the field."
  nf_cpl.32.a:0 "Still many bricks to go!"

  nf_cpl.33.t:0 "Canadian Worker Democracy"
  nf_cpl.33.d:0 "Redmond is a stir once again, workers line every street and alleyway that leads to the polling station. Election day has come and with it a sense of pride for their country. The first election in Canadian history since the American invasion has brought every eligible citizen out to vote. Even though it is only workers who are allowed to vote, the polling station is filled almost to the point of bursting.\n\nThe halls of Congress lie in wait for its new batch of representatives, Thao in turn stands amongst the candidates awaiting her new colleagues. With the ballots now cast and the voting finished, the outcome was as forecasted. The candidates backed by Thao won by a landslide, and Congress is now held by a Thao loyal majority. Only a small minority is left to ensure responsible governance, but Thao’s dream of a worker-led Canada has been reaffirmed by the voice of the people."
  nf_cpl.33.a:0 "For Workers! For Canada!"

  nf_cpl.34.t:0 "The North’s Keepers"
  nf_cpl.34.d:0 "The endless lines of barbed wires mark the territory of the Black Collective. From settlement borders to crisscrossing roads these wires are the last show of order in the north. The armed wing of the Black Collective marches these lines daily, keeping the rural bandits at bay. Every militiamen sports a mismatched collection of equipment, no one soldier’s kit is the same or even similar. Some march in former Strath army boots and others still sport the latest fashion from the two-century-dead United States army. Their weapons are in a much more dire state with some wielding single-shot pipe guns rather than proper rifles. However, their domain is not questioned. The brutality from the early days of their watch still haunts the rural bandits.\n\nStories of Sorel’s hanging and the endless rows of pikes still make their rounds on the other side of the barbed wire. New atrocities still surface on the daily, Fedorov removed any restrictions on his men letting them patrol how they see fit. In turn tales of hangings, live burials, ritual burnings, and everything in between make their way to Fedorov’s ear. Little care is given by Fedorov, who uses these tales to maintain a semblance of peace within his domain. Beyond the barbed wire line, there is just lawless waste and the armed bands who exploit the vast permafrost for their gain."
  nf_cpl.34.a:0 "There is always another tale."

A fervent proponent of Jiang Qing Thought, May seeks to unite all of Canada in a rational worker's state. Of course, a worker's state will still need someone to tell the workers what to do...."

  STC_ANTOINE_SOREL_NAME: "Antoine Sorel"
  STC_ANTOINE_SOREL_DESC: "The party’s charismatic farm boy was originally born into a family destined for historical oblivion. A simple lowly peasant family toiling in the fields worthy of little mention or caps. However, his adulthood would give him the perfect opportunity to prove his worthiness to the party. With dreams of philosophy and communist thought in his eyes, Sorel would spend his nights writing away about every and any topic. He left no stone unturned in his writing ventures just as he left no seed unplanted in the fields. His work ethic and writing quickly became a topic of conversation among the party officials, especially once Teresse lost favor. Now, the commune’s beloved farm boy shepherds the nation through a green revolution to break the chains of crash industrialization."

  STC_COLONEL_THAO_DESC: "The earliest memory Amanda Thao can remember is her parents quizzing her on the weekly party-mandated homework/ Lessons on worker unity and the superiority of the communist system. As she grew and joined the revolutionary army, she came to see the cold hard facts of reality. The rosy vision of utopia painted for her in those workbooks was nothing but fantasy. In truth, the system created famines, endless wars of conquest, and an endless number of graves. However, she continued in her duty denying herself any thoughts in contrast to the party. Her artificial mindset was shattered when she led the raids down into the Pioneer Company. Unlike Strath, their shelves were at least half filled and their factories weren’t akin to graveyards. While these raids opened her eyes, she returned as a war hero for the party. They carted her around to propaganda events while she secretly fostered a new revolution. A revolution filled not with idyllic dreams but stocked shelves and healthy factories."
