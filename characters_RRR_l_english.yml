Now, they say there is nothing but death and ghosts within the woods. To some, the silence is the scariest part: because it means they've already killed everything else off."

When he emerged from Destiny's inferno, he did so a changed man: now, the fearsome Frostlurks of Lake Winnipeg answered to him, a nine-foot tall abberation of a man that could no longer even speak in a human tongue. \n\nHis guttural cries and wicked thralls haunt Duck Mountain's nights. Some say he lives on in the Eastern Blightwoods-- but surely such a man is nothing more than a terrible fable and legend..."

  RRR_forest_expands_category_desc:0 "Originally created from Destiny's experiments, Smiling Jack and "men" like him have found a way to continue the terrible Blizzard by wresting the knowledge from her. Its mutating effects will continue for as long as the snow falls, and the trees of the Blightwood will continue to grow strong from it."
