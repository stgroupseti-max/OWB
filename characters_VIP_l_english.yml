  VIP_VERONICA_FAUST_NAME: "Veronica Faust"
  VIP_VERONICA_FAUST_DESC: "Descendant of the original Viper leader Jonathan Faust, Veronica took control of a small splinter of the Vipers when they shattered across the wasteland. Leading her group to Nevada, the small warband found a new home amongst the arid, desolate flats of the desert. It would take Veronica just under a decade to re-establish the Vipers as a force to be reckoned with in Nevada, fighting constant battles against Rangers and the NCR. While the efforts of the NCR have lessened over the years, other forces are looking to claim the area the Vipers are calling home now. She's definitely got a fight on her hands if she wants her ancestor's legacy to live on."
