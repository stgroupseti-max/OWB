  paradise_state_modifier:0 "The Forbidden Temple"
  paradise_state_modifier_desc:0 "§gThe local tribals handle the region as a holy site, and as such, we cannot use it for industrial development, nor as a base for conscripting manpower from there.§!"
  boulder_state_modifier:0 "The Radiating City"
  boulder_state_modifier_desc:0 "§gThe City of Stone, Boulder City, had been heavily nuked during the Great War. The influential research facility in the city only known as the "Dome" made it such a target. The radiation still lingers on the city grounds, and while the local ghouls have grown accustomed to that, it still heavily restricts every larger-scale operation in the area.§!"
  boulder_state_GLW_modifier:0 "Stone City in Ruins"
  boulder_state_GLW_modifier_desc:0 "§gThe City of Stone, Boulder City, had been heavily nuked during the Great War. The influential research facility in the city only known as the "Dome" made it such a target.

  boulder_state_GLW_modifier_2:0 "Stone City Rebuilt"
  boulder_state_GLW_modifier_2_desc:0 "§gThe City of Stone, Boulder City, had been heavily nuked during the Great War. The influential research facility in the city only known as the "Dome" made it such a target. We cleaned up the narrow streets and relocated the nuclear waste with such a strategic mindset that it does not concern us anymore, but would be a real headache for anyone who would try to siege the city.§!"

  blc_idea_mormon_mission_desc:0 "A mission from [NCN.GetName] is present in our country, swaying our politics somewhat as they attempt to convert the populace."
  blc_wyoming_trade_wyr:0 "Trade with the Wyomingites"
  blc_wyoming_trade_wyr_desc:0 "Agricultural food products and low-level tools while something our country necessary needs. But securing a safe surplus of those items would lessen the need for us to produce those, alleviating some weights from our producing sector."
  blc_wyoming_trade_kha:0 "Trade with the Wyomingites"
  blc_wyoming_trade_kha_desc:0 "Agricultural food products and low-level tools while something our country necessary needs. But securing a safe surplus of those items would lessen the need for us to produce those, alleviating some weights from our producing sector."

  blc_shunned_society:0 "Shunned Society"
  blc_shunned_society_desc:0 "Mercy is a double-edged sword, sometimes even in the most unexpected forms. Making a deal with the local raiders groups, Black Canyon made sure that every nation around it believed they became one of them and thus, stopped any and every contact with us. We will have to work hard to clear our name because if we cannot trade for essential supplies, such as weapons or machinery parts, we will be trapped in the mud forever."
  blc_political_ceasefire:0 "Political "Ceasefire""
  blc_political_ceasefire_desc:0 "After various concessions and at the cost of massive political power, we managed to force a §G"political ceasefire"§! upon the Gathering. While the agreement is active, we can lay back and relax a bit - and we can utilize our factions for our best intentions without worrying the opinions of the others about it.

  blc_raider_ceasefire:0 "Bargain with the Mallet's Clique!"
  blc_raider_ceasefire_desc:0 "Our concessions, exceptions and loosening expectations satisfied Mallet's Clique, at least for a time.

  blc_circus:0 "Panem et Circenses"
  blc_circus_desc:0 "The Raiders' Circus is more of a mocking name for our program, but its fundamental role works better than we hoped.

  #Raider Ideas
  blc_simple_solutions:0 "Simple Solutions"
  blc_simple_solutions_desc:0 "We do not need any fancy tricks for our weapons or armours - the simplest solution is the best solution. Maybe it cannot rival our enemies' equipment, but one thing is certain - we can make them easier and quicker than the opposition."
  #Tribal Ideas
  blc_prison_equipment:0 "Ancient Armour-Making Techniques"
  blc_prison_equipment_desc:0 "The Painted Men became such an important player in the region because of their highly successful military prowess, and that achieved because of their thick and light armour.
