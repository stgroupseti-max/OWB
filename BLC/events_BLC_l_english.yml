  nf_black_canyon.1.title:0 "Under the Big Top"
  nf_black_canyon.1.desc:0 "The United States Penitentiary Tibbets, known as the "Big Top" for its rotunda dome, served as a prison for America's most dangerous criminals before the war. It was automated and managed by an AI and its robotic servants, who kept refilling its cells with new inhabitants even after the bombs fell.\n\nEventually, the prison began to receive a large number of new inhabitants. Not long after, a group of mysterious assailants breached the Big Top. Nobody within understood their purpose, and if they had, some might have stayed within the prison. But they opened the way for them to escape, and so everyone chose freedom.\n\nThe original criminals, who got in before the "Baby Boom", remained together and started raiding nearby areas. They were led by Mallet McBride, who came from the far land of the Mojave. The town of the Boat fought against them for a while, before they gave up and started to pay them tribute.\n\nDue to the threat of the Hangdogs, they signed the Tibbets' Compromise with Battery's Caravan. They promised to fight against common enemies and to not hurt their new people, but they were allowed to live mostly outside the law.\nHow did they react to the situation...?"
  nf_black_canyon.1.a:0 "Mallet knew his place for once."
  nf_black_canyon.1.b:0 "They constantly tested their boundaries."

  nf_black_canyon.2.title:0 "All of the Painted People"
  nf_black_canyon.2.desc:0 "In the untouched lands of Northern Colorado, a tribe that dedicated itself to uniting each other with ink and blood arose from the ashes of the Great War. For a time, they were a large nation, but broke apart into smaller tribes. The Painted Men are the largest remnant of this old nation. The Iron Lines or the Ciphers are now nothing more than distant cousins, and salvagers from Denver occupied the barren land between them.\n\nThey believe in the magic of the tattoos they carry on themselves, providing luck against the misfortune and strength against their enemies. They're led by the Warded, a shaman hailing from the nearby Tibbets Prison, whose body had marks of magical ink the tribals had never seen before. His rhetoric demands war against the southern salvagers and those who don't wear the Ink themselves.\n\nWhen the Caravan came and pushed for an alliance against a greater threat, they were quite enthusiastic about it. However, problems arose when the negotiations touched on finer details. The Warded worried he would lose influence over his people as 'secularism' and 'research' threatened to change them, but being offered old territories in the Rockies satisfied him."
  nf_black_canyon.2.a:0 "He saw the opportunity in the situation."

  nf_black_canyon.3.title:0 "The Coalition"
  nf_black_canyon.3.desc:0 "Nestled along the waters of the Platte tributary lies a group of settlements primarily made up of escaped slaves from Dog City and raiders from Tibbets. These free and proud people claim a strong culture of weapon ownership and militia organization. They lived in peace, expanding as slaves slipped through the grip of both Dog City and Mallet alike, but their very existence in this place was taboo to the Painted Men. They lived on the sacred ground of their people, and they did not like sharing with the Tribals who had lived there for centuries. Mallet McBride despised allowing former slaves to live free so close to his territory. They needed someone to help organize and lead them.\n\nFrom the township of Medicine there was a family who had lived there longer than anyone else. They gave the first escaped slaves a place to go and protected them. This family was known as the Rivers. Everyone in the Yampan Confederation knew that one of their members would become their leader, but the only question was who.\n\nSurprisingly it was Bearhard. He was an imposing man and a crack shot with a rifle, but he was quiet and sullen, unlike his brothers. He did not say much, but what he did say made the people of his settlement listen. When he was appointed, he proved to be an extremely adept statesman. He organized his people into a navy to protect the waters of the river and encourage trade.\n\nHe is the only one that took the initiative to join Battery's Black Canyon Confederacy. After all, it felt similar enough to their own. Battery knew to be wary though. He supported the Confederacy's ideals, but had quiet ambitions of his own."

  nf_black_canyon.4.desc:0 "Black Canyon is home for a lot of different people. All of them came under our jurisdiction with our formation, with one exception.\n\nThe Glowbugs, as they call themselves, are a large group of glowing ghouls who reside in the ruins of Boulder. That city is the home of the Dome, a pre-war facility that holds many secrets to this day - and scrap, tons of valuable scrap. The Hangdogs eye it enviously. Our formation was made to deter their aggressive behaviour, and we would never let them victimize another small group if we can help it. The Glowbugs were not directly integrated into the Confederacy, instead remaining a semi-independent ally. A brother nation, if you will.\n\nWhile dealing with them will have its challenges, our first contact made such a great impression, its echoes still can be heard in our country. Who did we meet with?"
  nf_black_canyon.4.a:0 "Patches, the funny and ever diligent scavenger."

  nf_black_canyon.5.title:0 "Where but for Caravan Would I?"
  nf_black_canyon.5.desc:0 "The Caravan 13, the travelling settlement that traversed Colorado multiple times, derives its fame from its original leader. Only known as "Prisoner 13", as was the number on her Tibbets jumpsuit, was a walking miracle maker on both sides of the Colorado River. She travelled Dog City before the Hangdogs came, met and helped the Baggers' during their First Expedition, and even got a personal audience with the goddess Diana. But most importantly to us, she went to Jericho and took the city's greatest treasure; Battery.\n\nBattery learned a lot with the Prisoner, as her ever altruistic attitude not only saved him from that hellish water plant but made the wasteland a better place. The man from Mesa Verde saw multiple times how a good deed could reward itself. But after countless shared journeys, the time came when the Prisoner had to depart from her best friend and the travelling community they built together. She said she was leaving on her §R"biggest journey yet"§!.\nAfter a tearful farewell, Battery took the caravan back to Tibbets. Their arrival could not have been better timed. The region was threatened by the ever expanding Hangdogs. The bickering people of the Rockies could not join forces against the threat the Hangdogs posed without the Caravan's diplomatic service, but in the end, they convinced Dog City to back down. They achieved a miracle that day, but the locals weren't sure they trusted the Caravan..."

  nf_black_canyon.6.desc:0 "Battery's foremost diplomatic trait was his approachability - he could find common ground with everyone. As he often told, he was a tribal, a raider and a settler in one person. The only exception to this rule were the dwellers of Vault 27.\n\nPeople surviving the Great War in their underground safe house, utilizing pre-war technology and ideologies, they were quite different from our people. While they were staunch isolationists, they had two groups that could meet with us; those voluntarily exiled from the Vault in the Hot Springs Resort outside, and the mercenaries of Ghost Division.\n\nThe Outsiders in the Resort were quite vocal about their hatred of the Downdwellers, speaking about the horrors of overcrowdedness and strict regulation. All who chose freedom had to leave the facility. They are nominally in Black Canyon territory, but Ghost Division's patrols place them at the mercy of their old home.\n\nThe Ghosts are a ruthless band of mercenaries in power-armour, picking any and all jobs available, quite often doing ethically questionable acts in the name of money and sustaining the Vault.\n\nThe Vault posed a threat, and so we took action to curb their influence..."

If one wanted to get water or set up a business in an old house they would stumble into a smoothskin or zombie one way or another, as everything is connected.\n\n After a while, the unimaginable happened, and a ghoul lady simply walked into a bar on the western edge of the city, a place where they never have to go anyway, and ordered a drink, and that started an avalanche worth of events..."

  nf_black_canyon.8.desc:0 "A new year, a new Grand Gathering. It couldn't be more mundane than the last one: people gather from all corners of the Federation. In primitive clothing and inked from head to toe came the tribals of the Painted Men, playing a rhythmic and dizzying song on their drums. The people from the Yampan Communities came in different but monotonous clothing, lumberjacks and fishermen alike, playing old world songs. The raiders of the Tibbets' prison were the worst - rugged leathers and rusty stitched-together armours, playing something loud and incomprehensible.\n\nAnd yet they are all our people, and the fact that they could sit down, negotiate and celebrate together was our greatest result yet.\n\nThis year's Grand Gathering went as everyone expected it to; everybody lobbied for their own interest. This year, however, the Caravan and Battery chose to side with the most convincing party."

  nf_black_canyon.9.title:0 "The Voice of the Gods and Unrest"
  nf_black_canyon.9.desc:0 "The Painted Men, similar to the other groups in the region, have just recently banded together for their survival. The little local tribes still maintain their own identities. There are only two things that tie them together; their shared cultural and religious beliefs based on the magics of the tattoos, and their leader. The Warded is the voice of the Gods, who reads the Lines of the Mountains. He tells the Gods' will by the flow of the rivers and by the dance of the winds, by the steps of the shadows and by the waltz of the fires. The magic of the Forms can be tapped and used by the mortals as well, if on their body they can mimic them by the Ink and please the Gods.\n\nThe Warded is the centrepiece of that conglomerate, and if we can either replace him or make him our ally, we could encourage our own ideas among the Painted Men without resistance. However, sooner or later he will lead his Holy War to the south, to unite the Painted People under his banner. If that war machine starts moving, we may not have the power to stop them."

  nf_black_canyon.10.title:0 "The Voice of Reason and Greed"
  nf_black_canyon.10.desc:0 "The Yampan River Coalition best illustrates our Federation - a ragtag community of different people who united under one flag in order to survive a significant threat. Every city in the coalition enjoys ample autonomy and local identity, making them more flexible, but also easier to tear apart. The coastal cities are mainly inhabited by fishers and tradesmen who operate on the Platte. Inland towns typically engage in logging and mining. With so many different people around, and without strong local leadership, our only obstacle is Bearhard.\n\nWhile the Rivers family was always an influential player in the region, Bearhard is the first that stands out from the crowd; being the most wealthy and having exceptional trading skills. He is also determined to reform the Yampan community, unconcerned who he might cross in the process. His stubbornness has earned him many enemies, which we can use against him if we cannot convince him to support our operations. But if we support his reforms, he may be satisfied with his lot."

While our scouts have reported numerous warmongering foes around Colorado, we're not confident that we need this protection.\n\nAltough, we also have to note here that the messenger made it very clear that if we refuse the "generous deal" that the Canyon offers, they might have to force it on us.

  nf_black_canyon.19.desc:0 "Battery of Mesa Verde looked at the majesty of the Pyramid of the Ouroboros. Once upon a time, he recalled visiting the village where men are strong, women are devout, and the cycle seemed like it would never end. The Prisoner had consulted with him in private about the differences and similarities of their tribes. However, where those in Mesa Verde understood that the outside world was not to be fully closed off from, those in Ouroboros had an almost tragic outlook on the world brought on by decades of borderline slavery by a madwoman.\n\nHecate was not the first to attempt to go against the tyrant known as Caesar, nor was she the last. However, she was probably the only survivor who had been given plenty of blessings by an unseen power. However, she had used these means not to better her society or others, but instead to create a devout army that was ultimately little better than Caesar's.\n\nNeither Hecate nor Jordan Dae could be found in the aftermath of our conquest of the region. Battery's thoughts returned to the present when three individuals, carefully selected by Battery himself, emerged from the Pyramid. One, an Oracle. The next, a Hound. And finally, a simple tribal elder, whom the local tribes had chosen to represent them. Battery asked for all three of them to make their cases as to which of the castes they belonged to would be absorbed into the society of Black Canyon, and which would be exiled.\n\nBattery considered his options, before making his decision..."

  nf_black_canyon.20.desc:0 "Battery wiped the sweat from his forehead. Even years after leaving for Jericho, the trip to and from Mesa Verde was just as hard as he had remembered. Despite his warm reception by those he had not seen in ages, he was most focused on meeting with the Nemonik. A visit to the Kiva revealed that, as Battery had fondly recalled doing so many years ago, the Nemonik and his assistants were still down there.\n\nBattery approached the old memory keeper, bowing in respect. "Nemonik. I'd thought you would have joined the spirits of our ancestors by now."\n\nA small smirk made its way through the stone-like visage of the Nemonik. "Battery of Mesa Verde, is that what you are called now? It has been many a cycle since you had left for Jericho. I know of your exploits since then, and the hand of protection you extend to us."\n\nBattery chuckled, giving a quick bow. "The pleasure is all mine, Nemonik."\n\nThe Nemonik's smirk quickly turned into a sour expression. "As much as I wish to congratulate you on your endeavors, I cannot personally say I agree with all you had done in order to get this far. But as you are now our village's protector, there is only so much I can say. But don't misunderstand my words as a form of exile or banishment, you have done the Ciphers proud. I only wish it could have been done through a different means."\n\nBattery bowed once more. "Thank you, Nemonik. But I must ask you for a personal favor. Long ago, you assigned my companion, whom many know as The Prisoner, the sanctity of a Personal Number. They were assigned the great 13. I would like to know what my number might be?"\n\nThe Nemonik brushed his grey beard. "So you wish to obtain the privilege of a Personal Number? Very well. Allow me to conduct the Number Ritual."\n\nApproaching the computer in the center of the Kiva, he opened what appeared to be a number program, inputting a series of numbers and letters into it. Battery watched in anticipation, paying close attention to the Nemonik's muttering.\n\n"Divide by the coefficient of the Boltzmann distribution, multiply by the factor of Benini... account for the actions, good and bad, of the Prisoner, and... how very interesting."\n\nBattery couldn't wait. "What, what is it?"\n\n"Fate has been very interesting to you, Battery. It seems the Personal Number the ritual has assigned you is... 14."\n\nBattery almost fell back. 13 had been the number the Prisoner had gotten from the Nemonik decades ago. And now he, the one who associated 13 with his past, present, and future, now was assigned 14. He did not expect that the number would make him any more significant than the Prisoner, but knowing it and the welcome of his tribe gave him comfort."

"I never got you. Day you showed up here, I thought you'd be like other tribals, chanting to some god and banging the pipes with a stick to summon some rain spirit. Yet here you are, unlike all these other convicts, actually getting work done. But you still find ways to slack off. You're a real enigma to me, Battery."\nAt that moment, the door flung open, an a bright light emitted from the door, as a sillhouette of a person in a faded blue and orange jumpsuit stood at the door...\n"Battery? Battery?!" A distant call of his name brought Battery back to the present.\n\nHe was no longer in the old Jericho, nor was he an engineer with Caulwell, the man had unfortunately been one of the casualties of the many raids on this town. Battery stood in the old water plant, long since enhanced by his old friend. Despite the age and destruction of the town, Battery had decided to pay a visit, not only to see about refurbishing and reconstructing the town, but to learn what Caulwell had done with the plan and apply it elsewhere.\n\nBut no matter how many times he stared at the machinery, Battery couldn't shake the memories of his time working here. When he returned to Black Canyon, he decided to start a minor personal project with all promising water technicians and engineers. He put them in a program known as 'Caulwell's Pride.'"

They have since formed communities around the Big Top and some of them help watch the very men that they had to serve. Others go to jobs in factories that they had to work for for years, but this time for a living wage. For those that cannot be staffed with free men, the Raiders now work as part of their penance.

It's where we met. Old Jake Caulwell's desalination plant. Run by prisoners, sinners, and me. Except now old Jake has been killed by a bunch of nutjobs worshiping an old road, and the desalination plant is in ruins just like the town is occupied by raiders. The best thing I can do for the town now is make them a new one.\n\nThe old plant was filled with the moans and curses of the damned. Remaking it now will provide a source of tribute to their new biker overlords thundering back and forth across that old-world road. Maybe now they'll see it as a thing of hope rather than the prison they saw it as before. I certainly hope so. Maybe clearing out the Mormons and their traditionalist ways will do this place some good. The Eighties and White Legs are acting like a storm to finally uproot that old rotting tree to allow new growth. New Jerhico could be a great place to live one day now that the plant is open and run by free men who understand it's value.\n\nIt's not as if I didn't get anything out of the deal either. Rebuilding the entire plant from scratch let me finally figure out more efficient ways to create clean drinking water. It was why I was there in the first place. All of that water and making it salty? A waste, truly. I know this caravan's place is not here. Time to continue onward to a new place. Perhaps a place we can finally put down roots at last?

Great for hitting people with enough force to kill them and break free. They armed themselves with the very tools they were using to break up scrap iron. I may have dropped a weapon out of my pack on accident as well, but I am sure it got into the right hands. Then the entire factory made a run for it.\n\nI am sure that my guides were suspicious upon their return to see an empty factory around me, a few missing blueprints (which I may or may not have stolen) and a smoking husk where the machinery was, but they took me at my word exactly like I thought they would.

When his nation collapsed, he decided to go looking for his old partner, the prisoner with a thirteen on their uniform. One woman knew he did not deserve such a peaceful and ambiguous retirement.\n\nEsther of Alcova was a member of the Yampan Confederacy. One day she met the love of her life, Marissa Walks-softly. A woman who had escaped bondage. Together they created a life. They adopted twin boys. Their family was a beloved part of the community.\n\nWhen her wife's former master came looking for her, and she pleaded with any power that could help for aid, Battery of Mesa Verde gave her wife back to him so that she could be tortured to death and executed as an example. If that wasn't bad enough, the civil war that resulted from this incompetent monster's regime took her twin boys from her too. She had nothing left but her rage and her years of training with the Yampan Confederacy Militia. Battery did not deserve a peaceful retirement.\n\nWhen she confronted him on that, he seemed to agree. He did not even draw his weapon to contest Esther riddling his corpse with bullets. Before long, all that was left was the wind howling through a Black Canyon stained with dried blood from the war, and the emptiness of a woman who now had nothing left."

Amelia Wrothwright's infatuation with Battery was the worst kept secret in all of Black Canyon. A good natured woman with a background in trading and mechanical ingenuity was in love with a man who had a very similar background.

The Painted Men took him in and looked after him expecting his death. Only he did not. His wounds healed abnormally quickly under their care almost as if he was warded from harm by the spirits. The Warded claims that his old spirit died and he was repossessed by an ancient Shaman of the Painted Men tribe. Battery suspects that Peter is just particularly good with words.\n\nWhen Mallet heard that Peter had survived and was empowered, he was overjoyed. Not out of any pity or love for Peter, but rather the fact that he can justify increased raids on the Painted Men tribe. When asked about this, he said that Peter never paid his Gang dues to leave the life behind him. The Warded claims that Peter died that day, and therefore these increased raids are not justified.

The banners of the Bull now hang heavy over their broken sanctuaries, and the once-sacred land echoes with the cries of a people torn apart. In the aftermath of such devastation, Diana, a figure shrouded in myth and whispers, has retreated deep into her domain—her divine grief twisting into something raw and unyielding.\n\nThe Nursery, a pre-war sanctuary nestled within our sphere of influence, has stirred to life. From within its ancient walls, faint echoes of Diana's voice reach out—a song laced with heartbreak, yet carried on a current of deep, tribal anger. Her sorrow has become fuel, her mourning a call to arms. The scattered remnants of the Twin Mothers now gather under her veiled guidance, their hands clutching bow and spear, their eyes set firmly on the fertile lands of Black Canyon. They no longer seek diplomacy, nor do they desire understanding—they crave a new home, one carved out by force.\n\nBattery faces a grim reality. There will be no peace with Diana, no negotiations or common ground. Her people march forward with the quiet fury of the dispossessed, and the goddess herself remains distant and unknowable—a spectral presence guiding her children from the depths of the Nursery. Now, Black Canyon must prepare. Walls must be fortified, alliances cemented, and every able body readied for the storm on the horizon. For when the arrows begin to fall, there will be no mercy."

Her surviving children, clad in simple leathers and painted in pale crescents, now tread softly into the outskirts of Paradise.\nThe refugees do not come with weapons drawn or voices raised. Instead, they move with the wariness of hunted animals, their sharp eyes watching the settlers of Black Canyon from the shade of twisted trees and rocky outcrops. They ask for little, but their presence alone carries weight—a question left unanswered. While some see desperate souls in need of aid, others see a risk simmering just beneath the surface.\n\nWithin the Caravan Congress, voices have begun to rise in concern. Skeptics argue that allowing the refugees to settle near Paradise could destabilize the fragile order Battery has worked so hard to build. Others warn that aiding them risks drawing the attention—and wrath—of Caesar's Legion. The refugees are survivors of the Bull's fury, after all, and any sign of sanctuary might be seen as an affront.\n\nBattery now stands at a crossroads. He can offer aid and sanctuary to these wounded wanderers, risking political backlash and Legion reprisal in the name of compassion. Or he can heed the warnings of his advisors, moving against the refugees to secure Paradise and silence any whispers of weakness. Somewhere deep within the Nursery, Diana listens, her voice faint but ever-watchful, as another choice carves itself into the story of Black Canyon."

They arrived at the threshold of the Nursery, where one of the Guardians, a towering relic of pre-war engineering, loomed in stillness. With trembling fingers, the tribal held the letter aloft, positioning it before the Guardian's sacred scanners so its cold, unblinking lenses could read the words etched within.\n\nThe letter was not a demand, nor a threat—it was a plea. Battery spoke of the beginnings of Black Canyon, of the sacrifices made alongside Prisoner 13 to carve out a fragile sanctuary in the wasteland. He wrote of their shared dream, a dream of legacy and stability, a place where people could stand tall beneath the shattered sky. And he wrote of Prisoner 13—how heartbroken they would be to see what had become of Diana's people, now driven to grief-fueled violence and vengeance.\n\nBut it was all for nothing. Battery's words carried the weight of desperation, yet they were powerless against the tidal wave of Diana's sorrow. In another world, perhaps, Diana and Battery might have been allies—friends, even. But that world is lost, buried beneath ash and blood. Now, all that remains is a goddess consumed by grief, a tribe on the edge of extinction, and a home that must be reclaimed at any cost.\nNo letter, no plea, no shared history can change that."

Your lands must be my peoples new home, there is no other way.

Smoke hissed from vents along its sides, and internal systems whined under impossible strain. Panic swept through the congress as the heads scrambled for the exits, shouting orders and overturning chairs in their rush to escape. Seconds later, the Guardian's chassis erupted in a cascade of sparks and flame, its core overheating beyond control.

This era of stability and prosperity ended when the news of war arrived from the north.\n\nThe Khans were refugees from the faraway lands of California. They were known as great warriors and commonplace troublemakers, but since they started to settle the empty plains, they were not causing much trouble. They were attacked by our northern neighbour, the Baron and his brahminboys. Bailey was always a shrewd man, but we would never know his greed would chase him into starting bloodshed over dusty fields and dried pastures.\n\nNeither of them are harmless or sinless people, and one cannot be sure which one of them would be our better neighbour."

  ### The Painted Men

  nf_pnt.1.title:0 "The Warded's Vision"
  nf_pnt.1.desc:0 "The Warded's pre-penitentiary life is a mystery. It was a time before the Ink had found him, a time where he had not yet seen the Glorious Goal, before his Visions, before he had a purpose.\nBut inside the Tibbets' Facility, everything changed; the trials of strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and even luck all had struck him, and yet he prevailed. After every struggle he survived, the Ink had taken more space from his skin, and those challenges made him more than a man. He was chosen by the God of Ink, Arlen, to be his Champion.\n\nAfter the Penitentiary was been opened by other forces he left that wretched place and found his people, the Painted Men. He taught them the art of war, warned them of the corelings from the dark of the night, and as soon the position was "opened", he became their Kende, their "High Shaman" as well.\n\nNow, after many trials from the Black Canyon as well, the Painted Men again can act independently and unite the fragmented Painted Folk in the region, as he promised the Painted Men before. War is coming, and as such, the Warded became their War Shaman, their Gyula, as well."

  nf_pnt.2.desc:0 "When the Warded first rose to the Painted Throne and started to shape the destiny of the Painted Men, according to his own Vision, the tribe was already scattered. The Painted Men had broken into multiple tribes long before the Scrappers from Denver invaded the place, and the already weakened nation has broken into pieces when they did. The northern little tribes, the Little Snakes, the River Foxes, and the Lone Rock would stick together, but the others have drifted away from the old ways.\n\nNow that the Caravan Congress holds power no more, we can reconquer old lands from the invaders. It will be a costly and challenging campaign, as the myriad occupiers of our sacred lands will surely resist when we arrive in their homesteads."

  nf_pnt.3.desc:0 "The Painted Men deeply believe in the power of the tattoos; the ink that engraves a body is just a memory of a finished trial, a means of invoking the might of nature. The Symbol of the Wind inked on the legs means that someone was swift on his feet, and in the process he bound the winds, so they may carry in his next run as well.\n\nTheir beliefs were challenged when New Canaan's missionaries arrived and started spreading the Words of Christ. While first they were almost shot on sight, in time they learned to tolerate each other. Their conversion is slow, and has yet to challenge the figurehead of the Warded. After all, if the Mormons entrench themselves too heavily, he will simply declare himself the reincarnation of Jesus. The Canaanites, while fundamentally annoying and hindering the Warded's strongman figure, do bring positive change to the land. That's something worth tolerating, at least for a while."

  ### The Yampan Community Coalition

  nf_ymp.1.title:0 "The Bear of the Yampa"
  nf_ymp.1.desc:0 "The Yampan Communities always were a democratic union of a sort. The coast could not survive without the inland towns, and vice versa, so their cooperation was always fueled by necessity. The towns are equal, and every one of them has exactly one vote; and almost always influential families got the vote for leadership. In the last two decades, the Lord Mayor was either a Woods or a Rivers.\n\nBearhard took the position directly from this father, Koda Rivers, and since then, the Communities started rapidly developing. He effectively used the alliance with Black Canyon to further said advancements.\n\nWhile Black Canyon may have fallen apart, the Communities are as strong as ever. The Yampans will continue to follow their Lord Mayor, without a doubt in their heart, even though he grows to be more autocratic and seemingly more obsessed with the Platte River..."

  nf_ymp.2.title:0 "The Trade Must Go On"
  nf_ymp.2.desc:0 "The Yampans' greatest power is their trade capacity. Their vessels venture far away, and the Platte connects to much larger rivers, thus they can even trade with the cities of the River League. The Coalition is only a minor player in the League's wider operations, however. There is actually one larger problem that hinders our capabilities; the city of Casper and the greedy Baron north of us. We cannot realistically rival the dockyards on the other shore, but that doesn't mean we cannot take that city for ourselves.\n\nThat and more are the main reason why Bearhard was the head of organizing the trading and economy in the Black Canyon Federation, but as they have fallen into the dust, we can finally focus on ourselves again. Setting back the focus from caravan routes to the Platte will surely be make our trading smoother and more effective. Even if that means that we'll have to get the competition out of our way..."

The Rivers have announced that they will refit their fisheries and fishing-rod manufactory to wartime dockyards and an arms workshop, respectively. Their sacrifice will be noticed by the populace for sure!"

  ### The Tibbets' Raiders
  #
  nf_bcr.1.title:0 "The Wasteland's Mallet"
  nf_bcr.1.desc:0 "The Tibbets Penitentiary's history is quite long and rich, but let's cut out the boring stuff and focus on none other than old McBride, the Mallet of the Wasteland.\n\nIt was secured by the 705th Military Police Batallion before the Great War, next to the Automated Convict Managing and Deterrent System, and as such, their green-and-gold banners were all over the place. Mallett took them and used them as his own, turning a symbol of protection into a symbol of terror. Real classy.\n\nAfter the gates of the Big Top finally opened up and people swarmed out, Mallet started to gather the people who stayed. The raiding of the countryside started almost immediately, mostly against tribals, simple folks without much organization for defence. Easy pickings, thin loot. The only exception was The Boat, a little town just next to the jail.\n\nWhile the arrival of the Caravan put a stop to that, their presence was actually quite beneficial for us; they developed the Penitentiary and the community around it to serve as their HQ. Their "Compromise", where we handled most of their military affairs, gave us more experience with leading genuine armies rather than mere raiding rabble. Now that they're gone, we can go back to good old raiding, and we can remind everyone who is the Mallet of the Wasteland. A disaster for all weak people, yet someone you can negotiate with. Hire him to raid your neighbour instead of you!"

  nf_bcr.2.title:0 "The Rough Life"
  nf_bcr.2.desc:0 "Not everyone wanted to follow McBride at first. There were other contenders to lead the rabble of Tibbets, so a simple solution was found. The Big Brawl, the greatest fistfight the wasteland ever heard of was organized inside the Penitentiary. 97 raiders used their fists to achieve glory and only three of them stayed standing in the end; Mallet, Ryan Mitchell and Ivan. Mallet stood tall, covered in bruises and bloodspots, and yet he was determined to kick everyone's asses under the rotunda. His eyes were gleamed with a madden look, like a Berserker who was ready to die just to achieve victory. The other two promptly bent the knee and vowed loyalty, and McBride found himself his right and left-hand men. While there were thick skulls to crack, McBride naturally emerged victorious under the pile of bodies he "malleted". Hammered. He meant hammered.\n\nThe Compromise, while it was humiliating to be ordered around, was a useful tool to keep us in check. It also made our Greenies somewhat more experienced. After the Big Brawl went smoothly, a new Compromise was made between him and his men, and all who later joined their ranks; they will raid as a profession, and as his employees, he will pay them with loot and drugs. A fine Compromise for everyone."

They would rather be alone in a dirty pit than at other people's mercy. And third, entertainment - they go after booze, tobacco and all the drugs we can cook them up. If they aren't a threat to each other, why on the good Earth would anyone stop them from having fun? We'll please our warriors, and in return, they'll work better. That's the Raiders' Way."

Each blast rattled the earth, sending stone and dust cascading down the mountainside. Chisels followed, carving rough outlines in the wreckage left behind. Entire sections of the old faces cracked and fell away, their features marred forever by McBride's ambition. The raiders laughed, the slaves coughed, and slowly, a new face took shape. It wasn't graceful, it wasn't clean, but it was unmistakable—Mallet McBride, sneering eternally down at the wasteland below. Whatever power those old faces held, it's his now."

  #nf_bcr.7.desc:0 "Jericho, Utah, former Four States Commonwealth: This city, once about to slip into a quiet death, now a loud and proud resurrection point, served as the staging grounds for the powerful meeting of two most menacing and badass characters that the wasteland had ever known. At this point, McBride had conquered most of Wyoming, the Dakotas, and the Canadian province of Manitoba. At the same time, Marianne had taken control of southeast Nevada and Western Utah, making their combined holds roughly the same size as the old Commonwealth.\n\nThe marriage proposal and national alliance first began purely as a business offer, something that would be beneficial for both parties. But these two characters weren't the typical suit-and-tie negotiators... both of them wanted to know if the rumours about the other were true. They were as similar to each other as they were deadly. Ruthless. Powerful. Skillful warriors. Quick thinkers. For those reasons, the boring back-and-forth dealings quickly escalated into a proper duel. Everything was acceptable; firearms, piercing-and-slashing weapons, unarmed techniques.\n\nTheir battle took at least an hour, ending with seven dead bodyguards, two severely injured. Marianne sent multiple crude bullets into her thugs, using them as human shields, breaking two ribs, while McBride got his own bullet piercings through his torso and lost his left ear. Nobody could tell the soft and sophisticated "Overboss" of the 215th was such a fierce warrior, nor that the violent and brutish McBride of Tibbets Prison could be so loving and compassionate... in his own 'unique' way. In their bloody duel, they found their match, figuratively and literally. By the time the physical violence was over, the confrontation turned to a more passionate form of struggle, a kind of rough love that was based on respect and violence."
