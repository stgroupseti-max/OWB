  #Starting Focuses
  blc_the_penitentiary:0 "The Penitentiary"
  blc_the_penitentiary_desc:0 "The old prison held a lot of things. Prisoners, mechanical wardens and a virus too. The last two hundred years weren't gentle with it, and the prisoners turned raiders, the wardens turned into scrap, and the virus into a plague. While the last two don't really concern us, the raiders would be hard to ignore."
  blc_people_of_same_kin_and_ink:0 "People of the Same Kin and Ink"
  blc_people_of_same_kin_and_ink_desc:0 "Northwestern Colorado was and still is an untamed wilderness. Somehow people live in it, without the help of civilization, and their strength and resourcefulness make them a force to be reckoned with."
  blc_home_of_bisons:0 "Where the Riverbend Provides"
  blc_home_of_bisons_desc:0 "While raiders and tribals may squabble in chaos elsewhere, the river communities were more stable. The Coalition has practised democracy for a while now, and while their views could be somewhat extreme, they're the closest we've got to civilization."
  blc_outsiders_come_glowbugs:0 "Outsiders Come - Glowbugs"
  blc_outsiders_come_glowbugs_desc:0 "They were radiant, they were tattered and torn, and they came pleading. While we would like to say that we helped them out of the goodness of our hearts, the situation was a lot more nuanced."
  blc_outsiders_come_caravan_13:0 "Outsiders Come - Caravan 13"
  blc_outsiders_come_caravan_13_desc:0 "They were just a large group of refugees, hailing from a great adventure all over the wasteland, but they brought something that was far more valuable than anything else. A man of tribal origins, with culture and know-how of the settlers and the mouth of the raider - Battery of Mesa Verde."
  blc_outsiders_come_ghosts_from_underground:0 "Outsiders Come - Ghosts"
  blc_outsiders_come_ghosts_from_underground_desc:0 "At first it was just barren land, but then an "Outsider" community formed, pushed up from down below. And behind them came ghosts in shells."
  blc_one_canyon_to_call_home:0 "One Canyon to Call Home"
  blc_one_canyon_to_call_home_desc:0 "We're all very different - the tribals, the settlers, the raiders, the ghouls and the vaulters as well. We share one thing, however - we all call the Canyon our home, and we are all ready to protect it from anything that threatens it. Whether it comes from within or without..."
  #'Beacons Alight' Focuses

  blc_beacons_alight_on_peaks_desc:0 "§gIf the beacons of the Rockies are lit, Black Canyon must be ready for war. - Battery§!\n\nBlack Canyon installed beacons - permanent fireplaces, all over the peaks of the Rockies in the past, as tools of warning if the Hangdogs offensive would ever commence. While that seems quite unlikely now, just recently new developments happened in the world that makes it justified to set them alight, warning everybody that threats are around us. The guards around there will do everything to protect them."

  #blc_taste_sweetwater:0 "Taste that Sweetwater"
  #blc_taste_sweetwater_desc:0 "The Sweetwater Crisis in gone on for a while now - the people residing in the Wyoming Basin, just north of our border, §Y[PRO.GetName]§! and §Y[SIE.GetName]§! are in a conflict with each other. While that region is important for us, as it holds rare resources, also the Sweetwater River that borders both of them would be an easily defensible spot as a northern border for our nation."
  #blc_taste_sweetwater_tt:0 "§gAn exodus of people from the north arrived in our lands, escaping from the war. While due to organised relief movements, we could settle a large portion of them in the §Y[PNT.GetNameWithFlag]§! lands, most of them remain without a home between the Rockies.§!"
  #blc_support_prospectors:0 "Another Round of Whack-a-Mole!"
  #blc_support_prospectors_desc:0 "§Y[PRO.GetName]§! are nothing but a bunch of lunatics, probably grown mad taking too much time down in the shaft. They're nothing but trouble, and we'll not sit idle and wait for them to cause havoc in our country - their brethren in Moletown is a problem enough already. We gotta whack them till we have the upper hand."
  #blc_support_sietch:0 "New Peak in our Range"
  #blc_support_sietch_desc:0 "§Y[SIE.GetName]§! is a resilient folk, who successfully resisted the raidings of the §Y[PRO.GetName]§!. They're a mixed people, having native indigenous people and rough riding cowboys as well in their territory - they're like our other little brothers. We'll send them an offer of protection and development, so they don't have to suffer from others anymore - well, except they will try to resist our good nature, it is."
  #blc_northenmost_state:0 "Introducing Legislation"
  #blc_northenmost_state_desc:0 "Now that the Wyoming Basin is under our control, we can start developing it. Our local overseeing office will be set up in §YFort Steele§!, and we'll bring prosperity and unitarism to the land - so they will accept their new overlord and the identity of a Canyonite, sooner or later."

  #blc_strike_deal_with_ghosts:0 "The Ghost Phenomenon"
  #blc_strike_deal_with_ghosts_desc:0 "The Ghost Division, mercenaries from Vault 27 always made us frisky. Power-armoured hire-to-kills in our backyard seem like an unnecessary threat to handle, even if until this point they didn't cause much trouble for us. But now they have awoken from their slumber and risen from their underground, and now we find ourselves in a hurry to find the answer to the question; "What we should do about them?"."
  #blc_expel_ghost_representatives:0 "Hunt Down the Ghost Division"
  #blc_expel_ghost_representatives_desc:0 "The Ghosts found us in a vulnerable spot, and they dared to use it against us. We'll not go out as easily as they believe - we were ready for this thing to happen, and now, they will see what happens if you attack a nation five times bigger than you."
  #blc_strip_clean_vault_and_resort:0 "Strip the Vault Clean"
  #blc_strip_clean_vault_and_resort_desc:0 "... from usable parts and resources. Get your mind out of the gutter. This is just another pre-war facility that has no more use for us than scavenging the working parts out of it and then letting it rot as it was before."
  #blc_ghosts_vaulters_and_corpses:0 "Ghosts, Dwellers and Corpses..."
  #blc_ghosts_vaulters_and_corpses_desc:0 "Vault 27 was a massive vault, and they still managed to overpopulate it, just to check out how people would react to overcrowdedness. Now that we opened the door and commanded everybody out of the facility, all we have next to their resources are their technology - which is, while limited, we take everything that we can get with our technical know-how level."
  #blc_give_back_springs_to_tribals:0 "Accept Barren Valley Into the Federation"
  #blc_give_back_springs_to_tribals_desc:0 "Historically, these lands were used by the local indigenous people to rest and heal their bodies in the wintertime. While the old Indians living between the peaks have long migrated away, our tribals probably would be happy to have the same to have the Warm Springs as their own."
  #blc_deal_and_vows:0 "A Long Term Partnership"
  #blc_deal_and_vows_desc:0 "When we found ourselves in a serious pickle, the Ghosts offered up their help, and we gladly took it - while they asked a serious price for it, it was worth it in the end. While we're good neighbours, we should extend our gratitude and offer them further development, just for the low price of their subjugation... not like in their current form they would need something alien as "independent foreign policy", anyway."
  #blc_develop_hot_sulphur_springs:0 "Develop the Resort"
  #blc_develop_hot_sulphur_springs_desc:0 "Barren Valley is more than the Vault under the surface, the Outsiders in the Resort also need some additional attention. Their life seems so mundane, trapped between the arms of the Rockies, abandoned by their own brethren... they need some kind of entertainment! A couple of arms workshops! They would love to work for us! They most certainly would..."
  #blc_constitutional_monarchy:0 "Reforming the Ghosts into Knights"
  #blc_constitutional_monarchy_desc:0 "The Ghosts are an effective bunch, but without a well-developed moral code, they're barely more than scary monsters. The codex of the Brotherhood could serve as a solid basis for the training of today's Ghost into tomorrow's Knight."
  #blc_kings_tithe:0 "The Overseer's Duty"
  #blc_kings_tithe_desc:0 "An Overseer has multiple jobs to do. Managing the everyday life of its citizens, setting quotas and goals, keeping the current projects alive and just overall keeping the Vault going. Also, an Overseer needs to pay his taxes. Regularly, without delay - or otherwise how should it be the pinnacle of its isolated community?"

  blc_deal_with_moles:0 "Let's Play some Whack-a-Mole!"
  blc_deal_with_moles_desc:0 "Just hit 'em when they pop up! And before they start to throw dynamite all over the place again. They are the descendants of the miners of Far Son and raiders who rejected the Compromise, holed up in an old pre-war bunker. They're armed and mad, and a great nuisance for us."
  blc_getting_rid_of_moles:0 "Getting Rid of the Moles"
  blc_getting_rid_of_moles_desc:0 "The Molehill needs to be filled up with water, or we'll never get rid of them. We'll make sure that nobody down in the "Underways" will have a comfortable space down there. But hopefully, they will not drown there. At least not all of them."
  blc_set_underway_ablaze:0 "Set the Underways Ablaze"
  blc_set_underway_ablaze_desc:0 "Now that we removed the pests from the area, we can finally destroy their ugly and gruesome constructs. At least we won some usable scrap on the endeavour. Hopefully they will not become too much of a hassle for our neighbours. Maybe they will find a new home where they can be dynamite throwing jerks in peace."
  blc_incorporate_moles_into_federation:0 "Invite the Moles Back into the Big Top"
  blc_incorporate_moles_into_federation_desc:0 "While Moletown is hostile towards us, it is not out of malice but out of a desire for chaos. We're pretty sure we could convince them to join forces with us and wreak havoc on our enemies. It will take some persuasion though..."
  blc_playing_with_bombs:0 "Kaboom and Kaboom Jr."
  blc_playing_with_bombs_desc:0 "After they let us in, it turned out Moletown was based on some kind of pre-war bunker, and later the Moles expanded it by blowing holes into the walls. While it is a pretty unique place to live, most of the locals will be happy to move back to the Penitentiary. The Moles are quite exemplary with explosives, and the "Kaboom" family are ready to set up a shop and sell us their weaponry, as well as how to make more."

  blc_powderkeg_of_colorado:0 "The Powderkeg of Colorado"
  blc_powderkeg_of_colorado_desc:0 "The Coloradan Powderkeg has been smoking for a while now: the region once known as the Front Range is filled with multiple groups of ghouls with overlapping claims of territory. Their complex set of alliances and hostilities against each other made the situation worse, and when a new contender arrived and set up shop, the fuse was lit. We'll have to intervene in the conflict for our own sake."
  blc_alliance_with_victor:0 "Positive Results"
  blc_alliance_with_victor_desc:0 "While the Californian Expedition got caught in the middle of the conflict, they managed to emerge victorious from it. We'll offer them full access to Boulder Dome for the low price of their controlled lands in Colorado."
  blc_alliance_with_victor_tt:0 "§gWe'll offer up to the §Y[BAG.GetNameWithFlag]§! a full access to the §YBoulder Dome§!, in exchange for their currently controlled lands. We're certain that they will not refuse an offer like this.§!"
  blc_unacceptable_conclusion:0 "An Unacceptable Conclusion"
  blc_unacceptable_conclusion_desc:0 "The Californians got forced out of Colorado for the second time in a row. This simply will not do. All of the other combatants in the Front Range are either fanatics, uncooperative, communists or a combination of some of them! We'll have to start an offensive against them, as long we have the chance to do so. We'll send a message for the [GLW.GetName] to mobilize, through their lands will the war begin."
  blc_situation_defused:0 "The Powderkeg Defused"
  blc_situation_defused_desc:0 "While it actually kind of exploded, we can say that the powderkeg got defused. There was no explosion hurting our sphere of influence, and now we even have a bunch of scientists that are ready to work on the Dome. We can finally utilize the place, and not just scavenge for usable parts."

  blc_lunar_eclipse:0 "Lunar Eclipse"
  blc_lunar_eclipse_desc:0 "While we aren't exactly sure what happened in the Pyramid of the Ouroboros, it seems the status quo doesn't change much. They lost one of their most prominent military leaders, and Hecate was ready to lead her army west across the Colorado River. Sooner or later we'll be the next ones on the list, so, while most people are against this idea, we'll have to take them out until we can. A war to precede another one - where has this world gone?"

  blc_howling_at_moon_desc:0 "Something happened in the Pyramid of the Ouroboros, and the §P"Goddess of the Dark Moon"§! has fallen. Their new leader has got his sights on our lands, and while their forces are in a bit of disarray, we'll not have much time to prepare against them. We'll fortify the borders - and if they want a piece from us, they will struggle for every centimetre they try to take."
  blc_howling_at_moon_tt:0 "§gDue to the recent developments on our western border, the Gathering has unanimously agreed on fortifying said border...§!\nAdd two levels of §YOutpost§! on every province bordering the §Y[ORO.GetNameWithFlag]§!, with the §Rexception§! of §Y[38.GetName]§!."
  blc_integrate_tribals:0 "What's Under Burning Springs?"
  blc_integrate_tribals_desc:0 "Burning Springs' chasm holed up lots of different nightmares, but they've already got handled by the brutes of Ouroboros. The hidden facility in the deep also has got mostly scavenged to the bones, but there are a couple of AGRICOLA machinery that if we take apart, maybe we could learn the basics of robotics. Also, we found an enormous coal site as well, and we could easily start mining it out if we ever decide to."

Their technology regarding excavation is far superior to what we have now, and also, their home, the "Deepmines" could be developed further from its current state."

  blc_integrate_oro:0 "Hecate's Greatest Treasure: Ouroboros"
  blc_integrate_oro_desc:0 "Ouroboros holds vastly different people behind his walls, as Hecate's caste system created groups with their own identities. The Daughters and the Hounds are zealous and most loyal to their leaders, but even in their ranks, there are exceptions. Not to speak about the common citizenry who makes the backbone of the community. After all, the people of the region did sigh with relief, after the local boogeyman was removed from the business. Not everybody will accept the fact that Ouroboros is no more - but who will do, will have a seat at the Gatherings."

  blc_our_green_fireflies_desc:0 "The [GLW.GetName] are an old ally of ours. While they're just peaceful glowing ghouls in a highly radiated area, they sit on one of the most valuable sites of Colorado. Being our buffer zone against the Hangdogs, we put a lot on the plate to defend them. Our cooperation was smooth with them until now, but they're planning something unexpected for the Grand Gathering of 2277. We'll see what comes out of it."

  blc_little_brothers_over_rockies_desc:0 "It seems our original ally, Patches, has asked Battery for a chance at the Gathering, as he plans to deliver a fiery speech for the support of the Caravan 13.

  blc_refit_camp_for_larger_operations_desc:0 "The Contact Camp is the settlement that they established in their concessioned land - a place where the radiation sickening hands do not reach, and the ghouls and humans can interact with each other.

Also, these are constructs that nobody wants to purchase, as they're being unprofitable, duh, and as such, usually are fairly cheap to acquire. We'll need every weapon that we can gather to refit our shambling army.\nAnd as we speculate, if the arms workshop is owned by private entrepreneurs, and not by our government, we surely can avoid suspicion from our neighbours.

  bcr_brahmin_tax_desc:0 "The land is ours, the cattle are ours, and the people are ours. With the Baron's Eyrie broken, we've set up shop in their ranches and workshops. Taxes are collected, fences are repaired, and our boys are eating steak tonight. Nothing personal—it's just business."
  bcr_hit_you_cant_miss:0 "A Hit You Can't Miss"
  bcr_hit_you_cant_miss_desc:0 "In a normal society, the introduction of a new type of drug would surely hit the overall stability of the realm - criminal activities skyrocketing, people start to panic, etcetera. In a raider-centred society, it brings only two things - jolliness and profit."
  bcr_unexpected_rivals:0 "Unexpected Rivals"
  bcr_unexpected_rivals_desc:0 "It seems we're not the only ones keen on taking a slice out of the wasteland in these abandoned lands. The Khans' stories are legendary; since their foundations, all they have done is losing and moving further east. They have an iron will and are hard to kill, that's for sure. But it seems it's time to add a new chapter to their legendarium and dispatch them further into the Midwest again - this is our turf."
  bcr_followers_outpost:0 "A Lesson from the Followers"
  bcr_followers_outpost_desc:0 "The Followers of the Apocalypse are supporting the Khans for a while now - we have no idea why, but maybe opposites do attract each other. Anyhow, since we're here, the Followers are keen to change us for the better - yeah, for sure. But they could teach us a couple of useful things, so, we'll dispatch Doc to give an angel act and bring back some knowledge, hopefully, without the hippy monologue."
  bcr_khan_culture:0 "Back to Their True Nature"
  bcr_khan_culture_desc:0 "The Khans ventured east to escape endless cycles of war, seeking peace in distant lands. But war is their blood, their tradition, and their purpose. Now under our banner, we will remind them of who they are. Their forges will burn, their weapons will gleam, and their warriors will once again stand ready."
  bcr_gallows_way:0 "The Gallow's Way"
  bcr_gallows_way_desc:0 "Vae Victis - Woe for the vanquished. A term is known well to everybody who met Caesar's army before, and the Khans' connection to the Legion is well known. All who resist will walk the Gallow's Way, the rest of them will have to pay, and of course, we will handle the money scale. As is natural."
  bcr_our_biggest_prey_yet:0 "Bastion of the Free States"
  bcr_our_biggest_prey_yet_desc:0 "Marshall's Republic traces its roots back to the Free States Movement, a stubborn bunch who stood against an empire that wanted everything under its boot. When the bombs fell, even the old National Guard joined them—no reason to keep fighting when the world ended. Two centuries later, they're still here, still holding on. But McBride and his gang aren't here to admire their resolve—we're here to break it."
  bcr_raid_on_rapid_city:0 "The Fall of Rapid City"
  bcr_raid_on_rapid_city_desc:0 "Rapid City isn't just some wasteland outpost; it's the heart of the Marshall's Republic, their pride and joy. But pride doesn't stop bullets, and walls won't hold against raiders who smell caps and chems. The boys are loaded up, the guns are greased, and every plank, every nail, and every cap in Rapid City is about to become ours. Sorry, Marshall—this one's not gonna end pretty."
  bcr_another_face_on_wall:0 "McBride's Face on the Mountain"
  bcr_another_face_on_wall_desc:0 "Mount Rushmore—an ancient shrine to faces on old-world money, a testament to power carved into stone. McBride doesn't care who they were or what they did; all he sees is an opportunity. If those faces meant power back then, then carving his mug up there means power now. With the mountain secured, the boys are ready to get to work—this isn't about finesse, it's about leaving a mark."
  bcr_another_face_on_wall_tt:0 "§gUsing some explosive and carving tools we'll carve our raider king's face upon Mount Rushmore!§!"
  bcr_marshalls_no_more:0 "Marshalls No More"
  bcr_marshalls_no_more_desc:0 "Marshall has fallen, the countryside is so sparse it is easily controllable, and their only valuable settlement, Rapid City, is almost completely dismantled. It is ours, their army scattered, and the only thing left to do here is start to collect the protection money - after all, now we're the only ones here who can defend them from raiders and such. Hehe."
  bcr_crown_for_a_king:0 "Not An Overboss - A King"
  bcr_crown_for_a_king_desc:0 "The title 'Overboss' signifies dominance among raiders, a warlord ruling over lesser bosses. But McBride wants more than fear—he wants respect from settlers and the remnants of the Caravan Congress. A King commands more than loyalty; he commands legacy. That's why McBride crowns himself not as an Overboss, but as the Raider King."
