  pnt_eighties_information_desc:0 "The Eighties are creatures of motion, forever chasing the horizon along the cracked highways of the old world. The road is their home, their shrine, and their cage. Ink Spot Oilfinger represents this ceaseless journey—black streaks and oily smears painted across their hands and faces, mirroring the stains left by the engines they worship. The Ink Spot reminds them of the sacrifices made for speed and survival, binding them to their roaring vehicles as if they were extensions of their own bodies. For the Eighties, the road is eternal, and Oilfinger marks them as its chosen children."

  pnt_white_legs_information_desc:0 "The White Legs are creatures of devastation, a tribe that moves like a storm across the ruins of the old world. They beseech any power that grants them strength, whether divine, mystical, or infernal. Ink Spot Paleface marks them in ghastly whites and pale grays, their skin painted to resemble bleached bone and ghostly specters. Their markings are a reflection of their ruthless determination and the void they leave behind. Whether they are driven by fear, rage, or reverence, one thing is certain: the Paleface mark ensures they are feared wherever their shadows fall."
