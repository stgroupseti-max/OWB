  nf_loi.1.d:0 "Our legacy does not stem from the desperate Canadian people, nor the Chinese who saw opportunity in dire times. Our legacy comes from Russia. We can trace our heritage to an expedition of Tank advisors sent to Canada to teach CPF soldiers how to use their tanks against the American Occupation forces, the bombs having turned their short tenure into a permanent affair.\n\nOver time we came to adopt more than just their knowledge of weapons. We fully inherited their religion, their culture, and their history. We merged their realities with ours to create something new in the storms of war. Our soldiers became the Spear of a new movement, a force of unmatched prowess across the wastes. We inherited much from our forefathers' pasts, of which the most important was..."

  nf_loi.2.d:0 "Nothing lasts forever. It is an inescapable fact of life, one which humanity has been fighting against since the start of its history. The Canadian People's Front proved no exception to this rule.\n\nBit by bit, piece by piece. Each backstab and rivalry brought it closer to its end. It all culminated in the shattering. A mass power struggle led to the succession of Amy Teresee as the new General Secretary. A vile creature who soared to the top through illicit means; her lust for power knew no bounds and nothing was beneath her in her quest to attain it. It took only moments after her ascension to General Secretary of the CPF that the People declared independence. Like dominoes they fell, breaking free from her yoke. The CPF was no more.\n\nPatriarch Solomon was an unimportant man during all of this, passionately preaching the good book to any who would listen. He, like many others, sought freedom from the ensuing chaos. He proposed a bold plan. He and his group, which numbered in the thousands, would march East to claim unoccupied lands, creating their own state. The journey was long, and fraught with many difficulties, but by God's grace, they made it."

  nf_loi.3.d:0 "Ask any member of the CPF what they thought about the Spear's tanks and you'd get numerous answers. Safety, Tyranny, protection, and might all typically come to mind. But all would agree on one thing. They represented power. When the people of Loidminster heard the rumble of tanks slowly approaching, they believed that may as well have been the end of their ill-fated expedition. They prepared for the end to come, making peace with God.\n\nBut against all expectations, the blasts never came, and not a single shell was fired.\n\nThe tanks stood eerily still outside the recently-reclaimed town as if sizing up their opposition. Snow blew heavily around them, isolating them from the rest of the world. Their fate would be decided at this very moment. A voice called out of the storm, emerging from where the tanks stood. It called for Solomon. The Patriarch followed the call.\n\nFrom that day onward, life began to emerge in Loidminster. A deal was forged between Solomon and the Spear's leader, Lydia Donosky. They no longer stood alone, and the Spears would shield the growing ministry from any that would seek to harm them."

  nf_loi.4.d:0 "The deep and personal friendship between Patriarch Solomon and Spear leaders Lydia and Ekaterina was once a beautiful thing, and their cooperation was the pride and joy of Loidminster's humble people.\n\nAfter Lydia's death, however, Solomon found himself frozen by grief and unable to cope with her loss. In her wake, apathy has slowly started to grip the state, with even the Church becoming more insular and self-centered. The common man cries out for a solution, hoping that the Ministry might yet return to the family it once was. Factionalism has taken hold, dividing the slowly decaying Church and the revolutionary Tankers of the Spear.\n\nPatriarch Solomon harbors hopes he can keep things together—Commander Ekaterina has seen Solomon's inaction and doesn't believe hope for a peaceful way forward is possible. Their followers rally behind them, and with the momentum of expectation at their backs, both know there is only one way forward. To save this city themselves, or to die trying."

Joseph responded, surveying the surrounding cliffs.\n"If that's the case, I ought to try less. This place gives off an... eerie vibe." Lev muttered.\n"Are you scared, Lev?" Joseph asked, clearly mocking him.\n"Don't start! I'm not in the mood for it." Joseph merely laughed, taking a swig from his flask. \n\nThe two journeyed on for some time, the winter storms around them growing more powerful. Joseph was in the middle of retelling a story when he froze in his tracks. He stared through his binoculars inquisitively, seemingly enamored with what he saw. "What? Why'd you stop? Are we in danger?" Lev asked frantically, reaching for his gun. Joseph did not respond, instead he removed the binoculars from his eyes and then rubbed them, looking back through the binoculars right after. "Joseph! What the fuck are you looking at!?" Lev twitched nervously, still trying to get his compatriot's attention. Once again, Joseph did not respond. He simply removed the binoculars and handed them to Lev, his eyes still fixed on what was in front of them. "Let me see. This better not be a joke or I swear I'll..." Lev left the sentence hanging, repeating the previous motions that Joseph did. In the heart of the blizzard lay a frozen field of dormant tanks, stretching as deep into the distant white as the eye could see."

  nf_loi.6.d:0 "Darkness covered the city of Loidminster, enveloping it in a sea of utter blackness. Not a sound did stir nor could a light be seen, save for one small office complex. Within its frigid halls resided Commander Ekaterina and Natalia Bell, the two tankers dwelling in the midst of something vast and treasonous—a mountain of paperwork that pertained to an inevitable coup. When the Spear's Commander made up her mind some time ago, she hadn't considered a stack of unsigned papers to be an important part of her scheme. But every loose end needed accounting for, no matter how dull the process may have been to some people.\nStifling a yawn, she continued viewing the documents that lay before her. The words began to jumble and turn to mush, her eyelids suddenly feeling very heavy. She had been moments away from sleeping when a voice stirred her awake. "Do you think Lydia enjoyed this aspect of the job?" The quiet voice of Natalia earned a quick snap of Ekaterina's gaze. The Commander clenched her jaw, tensing up slightly. The thought of Lydia's passing still stung. "No. Not one bit. However, were she here, she would have already finished this by now." Ekaterina stared at the papers.\n"We probably wouldn't have had to go through this in the first place," Natalia corrected. She was right. It was Lydia's iron will that had kept the tankers going when times seemed darkest. By her and Solomon's will had Loid's Ministry been forged in the first place. Ekaterina missed her dearly.\n"Waste of time." She muttered to herself.\n"I miss her too, Ekaterina." Natalia said. Ekaterina looked up quickly, cursing herself for showing off her emotions so easily. "You're allowed to mourn, to take time to process things. It's a healthy thing to do," Natalia whispered hopefully.\n"When I have time," Ekaterina stated sternly, hinting that she wished for the topic to be dropped.\n"She spoke highly of you, when you were younger. When I stepped down, it was pretty clear who she was going to choose to fill in my role. She wouldn't want you to lose yourself." Ekaterina did not respond, instead opting to huff and continue working. She had no time for emotions, there were things to be done.\n"Well, that's odd," Natalia muttered. She looked up. "You really have no last name, Ekaterina?"\n"No. Never concerned me," Ekaterina huffed. "Lydia was my family. I did not care for my parents," she added. She looked over at Natalia and saw her staring down at a blue and pink sheet of paper. It looked familiar. A thought crossed her mind. "May I?"\n"Of course."\n"Thank you." Natalia passed her the birth certificate, and Ekaterina picked up her pen. She hesitated, then made a careful edit, donning the surname of a friend who should've lived longer.\n§1Ekaterina Donskoya.§!"

  nf_loi.7.d:0 "Ekaterina breathed out a heavy sigh, her eyes shut tight as she listened to the sounds of battle raging on outside. Adrenaline coursed through her mind, her anxieties attempting to crack her. She maintained herself; she had to do this. A voice called out to her "Dukov's close by, we're nearly finished," it said. Ekaterina turned to face the voice and was greeted by the leader of her spy agency, Mikhail Volkov. "We're doing the right thing, Ekaterina. You know that, right?" He stared right at her.\n"Of course," She responded sternly, half trying to convince herself.\n"You'll see, this is what we have to do," Volkov said, seeing right through her facade. She opened her mouth to respond, but a door crashing open nearby stopped her. In came Sava Dukov, flanked by three soldiers. Held up by his arms was Patriarch Solomon, himself beaten and bloody. Thrown to the floor, he cried out in pain and looked up at Ekaterina, tears streaming down his face. "Why? Why have you done this? So many innocent people were harmed because of you," Solomon whimpered.\n"How dare you accuse me of this! You're the one who did this. You forced my hand. Your apathy, your blindness. You did this!" Ekaterina screamed at Solomon, himself becoming slowly more horrified as she went on.\n"No, No! This isn't right! We could have fixed things! Ekaterina, please! You can make this right, call off your troopers and we'll talk things out, please!" Solomon pleaded. Ekaterina looked him in the eyes. A sea of emotions flooded through her mind. One question constantly echoed through her mind. 'Was she doing the right thing?'. She turned around and began to pace around the room. "I tried to speak to you! Tried to warn you! Only now do you plead for forgiveness. How do I know you'll be true to your word?" Ekaterina asked.\n"You can't be serious," Volkov muttered in horror. "This scum sat around doing nothing while our people suffered. He must be judged for his crimes!"\n"Quiet!" Ekaterina yelled at Volkov before turning her attention to Solomon "I shouldn't forgive you. The people deserve justice. But if you and your people can promise to work with us for the good of the nation, I'll let you walk free." She pursed her lips, her eyes narrowing towards Solomon. This hadn't been the plan, but seeing him on the ground crying—it hurt her. "Okay. You're right. I let apathy consume me, but if you'll forgive me and my people, I promise you we can work together." Solomon lifted his head and tried to force a smile in spite of his bloodied mouth. "So that something like this never happens. Thank you, Ekat-" A gunshot rang out. Solomon fell to the floor as blood began to gush out his neck, slight gurgles escaping his mouth before he fell silent."

Chairwoman Teresee, you stand accused of physical and verbal abuse of the Canadian workers under your stewardship, treason of the Front, war crimes of the highest accord, and resisting arrest. How do you plead?"\n\nAmy did not utter a word. She scanned the halls of the crowded tribunal, her cold gaze stabbing into each and every one of the bureaucrats looking down at her from the gallery above. Many, she recognized. Frustrated, stuck, incompetent mid-ranking officials in the old days of the CPF. Now they sat rebranded as the Patriarch's "Clergy," spewing whatever it took to get ahead.\n\nThese were not comrades. They never were. Drifters willing to betray the values they professed to believe in during their infancy, just before they could blossom into something beautiful. She should have leaped into the Saskatchewan as soon as they crossed into Redmond. Would have been a more noble end than whatever was ahead for her.\n\nHer vitriol hung on the tip of her tongue. But she wouldn't give them the satisfaction. Not on that day. Her head dropped back down. They'd gotten the message.\n\nThe jury members watched her disinterestedly for a few moments before exchanging knowing glances at one another. No deliberation was needed. "Chairwoman Amy Teresee.

  nf_loi_solomon.12.d:0 "Redmond held many difficult memories for Solomon. It had been the city he called home for the majority of his life, and for that he was grateful. It provided safety and the opportunity to bring the word of the Lord to his people. But to say that he was proud of his former home would be far off from the truth. Despite this, he still felt an insatiable urge to visit it. Much time had passed, and a sense of nostalgia pulled him towards the old city.\n\nSolomon made his way towards one of the old churches he and his people had used during the troubling twilight era of Strathcommune's dominance. In truth, the church had simply been an abandoned building converted for religious use. Old thoughts brought a smile to Solomon's face. He greeted the clergymen within the church with a smile and open arms, touching base after he had been so busy.\n\n"My friends, how go things for you?" he asked. The Clergyman all greeted him with reserved joy.\n"Quite well, Solomon. Reconstruction efforts progress at a steady pace, and the people are happy," one of the clergymen spoke up. "There is one small issue we've had come up," he added, pensively.\n"What is it?" Solomon's concern was palpable.\n"Well, it's the matter of Amy Teresee's grave. We've tried to keep it clean, but people keep vandalizing it. We've found it covered in paint and oil on numerous occasions, and the headstone keeps getting damaged. It's already been replaced twice." The Clergyman scratched his neck. Solomon looked at the roof, lost in thought. It was a difficult subject. While it was quite clear that no one mourned the loss of Amy Teresee, desecration of her grave was not something that Solomon wished to condone.\nHe looked towards the Clergymen. "I think I have a solution."\n\nHer body was unearthed and moved at dawn to a secret and solemn location. Only Solomon would know where. By a lone tree, a grave was erected. It was modest and small, having been erected out of small stones. Atop the low pile, a hammer and a sickle were laid curved over each other. The Patriarch knelt and uttered a quiet prayer before turning to walk away."

The two of them had returned to RELCOM's main base to investigate further after the previous event that had led to RELCOM's death. The pair of them navigated their way towards the main console, being careful not to step in any of the molding brains that lay scattered across the room. "You say he began to explode these brains?" Solomon asked. "I can scarcely believe it myself, even though I was there myself. The fact that this thing was commanding armies of robots is a terrifying thought." Dukov said "Agreed" Solomon responded. \n\nThe two of them had made their way to the central console and Dukov began to push some buttons on it. "Huh, the thing still works." He said surprised. "Can you see if any brains survived the ordeal? It would be best if we shut them down to avoid another issue." Solomon asked. Dukov grunted and began to type. "There seems to be four left. Screenplay, Shades of Red, RECLOM's Manifesto and You part 1. What the fuck was wrong with this machine? It's just layers and layers off incomprehensible text stuffed into brains like they're holotapes" Dukov said, anger in his voice. "and... Hayley?" Dukov said confusedly. "Hayley?" Solomon asked. "Yeah. Unlike all the other ones, it's still connected to Relcom's interface. It hasn't deteriorated much. Now that I think about it, Relcom specifically avoided exploding it, he said it was precious. Maybe we ought to investigate?" Dukov asked. Solomon hesitated, afraid they might be getting too curious for their own good. Still, Dukov and himself were capable, and he found himself very interested in Hayley. "Sure, turn it on. Just have your weapons ready." Solomon said sternly. Dukov hit a few buttons. Nearby a noise could be heard. The pair looked as one of the brain jars started flickering, its monitor turning on. On the screen, a crusty image of a small black cat with a small white spot on its chest, the speakers of the jar emitting a faint, low quality meow. "Is that?" Dukov asked. "There is no way," Solomon muttered, shocked."

For the first time in years, he had finished going through his backlog by 5PM sharp. \n\nHe stood up and walked over to the makeshift dispenser he had set up in the corner of the room, before pouring himself a glass of icy-cold, purified water. He moseyed back on over to the window, glazing over the city as he brought the metal cup to his lips. \n\nThe disinfestation of the Clergy was starting to bear fruit. He had begun to notice the volume of duplicate and redundant paperwork thinning over the past few weeks, but he hadn't fully grasped just how much of his day was spent sorting through them. Hours and hours of his life gone down the drain, spent worrying about everything from malicious sabotage to plain incompetence at the hands of that a institution - \n\nNo. He caught himself.

Despite their... rustic appearance, they have somehow gained access to relatively sophisticated sky-faring technology - and are making damn good use of it too. \n\nNot surprising really. From the few artefacts we could recover, they seem to fanatically worship anything with a set of wings. Troublingly, they display just as much fervor in making an example out of anyone caught in their territory. \n\nWhat an absolute headache, Solomon thought to himself. For as much as he wished he could help these pilgrims of the sky find their way once more, his resources were stretched to the breaking point. And what if something went awry? Visions of Loidminster aflame tormented him. \n\nBest play it safe. He would send one of his top diplomats to make contact with the tribe. May God be with him."

The next day, a minor Feral Ghoul force was repelled from the crater, followed by two patrols being sent to scout the nearby woods and hills. Researcher REDACTED was able to connect a terminal to the satellite, extracting the information within.

The structure was surrounded by a 5 meter high wall, with a single gate into the main courtyard. Entering the courtyard, camp was set up outside the structure, identified as a pre-war building belonging to REDACTED. At 1400 hours, building was breached by Squad REDACTED. Interior was covered in deactivated monitors and terminals, with REDACTED listed under them. In the building's center, located in what appeared to be a control room, was a large REDACTED REDACTED, with a single terminal at its base. A large seal was placed on each wall of the room, bearing the same pre-war organization emblem. (Commanders personal note—Emblems appeared to have been altered with a new motto after installation. See attached image.) Building was without power, so none of the terminals could be accessed initially. At 1700 hours, attached Researcher REDACTED was able to rig up one of our portable generators to the main terminal, restoring power to the central REDACTED. \n\nOnce activated, a database was activated, showing a long list of reports and ongoing operations. Most reports referenced the REDACTED, as if they had been monitored for an extended amount of time, listing results like some form of experiment. However, other reports referenced the REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED. Before we could investigate further, our access was removed and the terminal was permanently locked. All attempts to regain access failed. After investigating the remaining rooms, structure was deemed to have no more useful items or information. Camp was deconstructed and convoy resumed. \n\n(Commanders personal note—I suspect that our access was blocked by an outside force. Matter was raised with Captain Ekaterina)"

  nf_loi_solomon.1.d:0 "Adrenaline surged through Solomon as he desperately searched for an escape from the burning church he was trapped within. His armor maintained its sturdiness, keeping him safe from the majority of the burning building. He burst through the door, just as the building came apart. He was greeted with the sight of Loidminster on fire. His knees gave out as he crashed to the floor, his face buried in the dirt. "Our father, who art in heaven..." Solomon was praying, fighting back tears as he kneeled down outside. Explosions rang out within the city, and the screams of people echoed throughout. The Tankers had begun to attack the city and its churches, firing on clergy and civilians alike. "Why, Lord. Why have you tested me in this way? What sins have I committed to have her betray me at this hour? Why does she seek my death?" Solomon asked. Yet he already knew, this had been all his fault. Apathetic to the cries of the people, distant from the tankers as he was consumed by grief. He had let this happen; all the blood that had been spilled was on his hands. \n\nThe sound of rushing footsteps alerted Solomon as he looked up and saw Sava Dukov, flanked by three men; their weapons drawn. "Dukov! Why have you done this?" Solomon cried out. Dukov did not respond, instead continuing forward; his expression was dark. "I beg for your forgiveness; I am truly sorry things became this bad. But this is not the way to be doing this, innocent people are dying!" Solomon cried out once again. This time Dukov hesitated, stopping in his tracks. His eyes turned to the floor, it was clear he was debating himself. "Dukov I promise we can fix everything, but this isn't the way to do it! We can work together, please!" Solomon pleaded. \n\nSilence befell the two men, the sound of explosions ringing out. Tears were streaming down Solomon's face. Dukov sighed and looked up. "He's right. I cannot go through with this." He looked towards the soldiers "And neither can you." Dukov rushed towards Solomon and kneeled down. "I am sorry for my actions. I just wanted to fix things, Ekaterina said she could. I ask for your forgiveness, let me help you stop her." Dukov pleaded quietly. Solomon looked at him solemnly. "Rise" He declared.

The Chief Engineer has rushed to bring him here, clearly excited to show the fruits of his work. With the Tankers now less than helpful, the Conversion Program serves as the solution to the problem of what to do with all the unmanned tanks. A few curses, in both Russian and English, and finally the shutter door rolled up. And out stepped something truly impressive. \n\nAn armored suit, constructed from armor stripped off a tank. Legs crafted from tracks and road wheels. The back hatch had been reshaped to allow the user to enter and exit the suit. The helmet was crafted from the tank's cupola, the eyes protected by a T shaped visor. Solomon was stunned. As Dukov walked around, demonstrating its movement and strength, the old ghoul stated that almost every component of the vehicle was used, except for the canon and its machined parts. He had yet to fully work out how to integrate those components yet, but Solomon was already impressed. With a bit of time, a whole division could be equipped with these "Gorod" suits."

Now that the war was over, and control over the remnants of the CPF firmly, they could turn their attention to other matters. More... radical ideas \n\nDukov called it the Conversion Program. They would take the old tanks and use their parts to make something new. Something that would give them an edge in spreading the revolution. The idea was different, yet it interested Solomon. As the meeting went on, the more Dukov's idea convinced him. He trusted the old ghoul, and knew he had the expertise to see such an idea through.

We've dealt with those nasty individuals. But that does raise an interesting point." Dukov stated. Solomon raised an eyebrow at him. "Go on," Solomon said. \n\n"Well, the tanks have become dead weight now. Of course, Tokarev and I can use them well. But for just the two of us to teach entire battalions. It isn't feasible." Dukov said. "I've had the same thought. But what are we to do with them? I have no interest in selling them off to any warmongers and I can't see how stripping them down would be useful at all." Solomon mused. \n\n"Aha!" Dukov said suddenly. "That's where you're wrong my friend. I've been workshopping recently, and I have some ideas. Take a look" Dukov said, as he pulled out a blueprint and handed it to Solomon. On it were pages and pages of notes. Designs and drawings of a suit of armor."

The two had been absentmindedly strolling around in Loidminster; locked in debate regarding the power armor program. \n\n"I am not trying to imply that the program would be inefficient, we've certainly seen the strength of our power armor units. But you must understand how expensive it would be, expenses that we simply cannot afford in our current state." Solomon stated. \n"The benefits would surely outweigh the costs! How can we push forward when we constantly limit ourselves with anxieties? We've seen far too well how apathy can doom a nation, even if we-." Both Dukov and Solomon froze as a loud noise erupted from a building nearby. A scream echoed out, causing the two of them to rush towards the altercation. \n\nInside the building was an incredibly odd sight. Two mutants were shouting loudly at a man; both their guns were pointed at him. §c"WHERE'S ALBERT?"§! one of them screamed at the man, himself too scared to produce a response. His silence only served to anger the mutant, responding by striking the man across his face. Fearing the situation would worsen quickly, Solomon quickly interjected; stepping between the mutants and their soon to be victim. "My friends! What seems to be the problem here?" Solomon asked quickly, a nervous smile on his face. §c"THE SLIME!"§! The mutant roared. "We've been tracking him for two years; he is a bounty target, to Battleford and yet he claims he doesn't know where Prince Albert is!" Solomon raised an eyebrow. "Battleford?" he asked. "Yes, we knew he was coming here so we followed him. But this place doesn't look very...'Mercenaryee'." The mutant said, his voice riddled with confusion. Solomon and Dukov exchanged glances, then looked towards the Mutants. "My friends, you're at Loidminster, Battleford is far east of here." Solomon stated. The mutants looked at Solomon, heavily confused. They glanced at each other, not knowing what to do. Then, at shocking speed, one of the mutants fired their gun at the man, blowing his head clean off. His corpse fell to the ground, blood gushing out of the shattered remains of his upper neck. The mutants slowly turned and stared coldly at Solomon. "This place is nice," one of the mutants said. "We are staying here now. Thank you." They exited, leaving both Solomon and Dukov quite dazed."

To purge it, we have to burn it from both the top and bottom. Arresting the most influential leaders as well as harsh punishments for anybody who takes part in these corrupt schemes will get the job done. There shall no be no mercy for them." \n\n Solomon leaned back in his chair, clicking his tongue in thought. He looked out the window, gazing at the city.

How do you plead? \n\nEkaterina hung her head in silence. Long gone was the fire and anger that had driven her initial actions. What remained was an ashen waste, subdued and cold. Slowly rising from her seat, she looked to the jury, and what they saw was a broken woman. With a noise akin to the silent breeze on a winter's night, she answered. \n\n"Guilty. I did all that was accused of me, though I knew it was right. I held out hope for as long as I could that Lydia's death would not mean the end of our ideals. That the Revolution would continue on, and free the people of Canada. Yet, as I watched the Clergy grow corrupt and fat, I knew something had to be done. So yes, I did lead the attack, though it was with a heavy heart that I did so. Yes, I did cause the deaths of our comrades, though each one killed my soul more and more. Yes, I did attempt to assassinate the Patriarch Solomon, for I viewed him as the cause of the Clergy's fall into decadence. And though I stand here as a result of my failed actions, I would gladly try so again, if it meant that I saved the people of Loidminster from corrupt tyranny. \n\nFalling silent, Ekaterina sat back down in the stand, and thus awaited her final fate. The jury was divided, and many hours were spent in deliberation. The speech was moving, and a few jurors had been brought to tears at the remorse in her words. Had she truly regretted her actions, and genuinely felt as if there was no other way? Others, however, were fearful of her open willingness to try such a dangerous coup again. The possibility of civil war, no matter how noble the intentions, was far too high for some.

She gripped the stand, her body tense, and her guards moved closer to ensure she would remain seated. With a roar as loud as the tank canons she fired, she responded.\n\n"Not Guilty! It is you and the Clergy who are guilty. Corrupt, decadent fools, who care not for the people and the Revolution. While you stay comfortable and stuffed in your gilded churches, the people suffer and cry out for justice. But there is no justice in Loidminster. It has been suffocated by the Patriarch and his sycophants. Ever since the death of Lydia, none of them have held the interests of the workers in their hearts. I did what I had to do, what every true believer in the Revolution would do, to ensure that the workers would be free from this tyranny. You hold this sham trial, in some cruel attempt to make me feel 'remorse' for my actions? Is that what you desire? To shame me in front of the people, so that your tyranny can continue unhindered by the cries for justice? I refuse! I do not show any shame for my actions. I would gladly repeat them if it meant that we would be free!"\n\nShe lunged forward, held back only by her guards and chains. The jury's rage at her outburst was matched only by their fear at her words. Her conviction, her zeal, her anger. Its strength was beyond anyone in this room. Unless action was taken, it could very well be the cause for yet another war within the cause of the Revolution. No, it must not be allowed to come to this. As the guards forced her back down into the stand, the jury was already prepared to deliver their verdict. Guilty of all charges. As Ekaterina stared up in anger at the judge, the gavel of justice was poised to deliver the final act of punishment.\n\n"Captain Ekaterina Donskoya, the people find you guilty of your crimes.

Now I offer you the same opportunity. Help the nation, help me. Let us work together once more" Solomon pleaded, extending his hand. She hesitated, a battle raging on within her.

"Due to the chaos of the civil war, we never fully figured out what happened with RELCOM. We're here to make sure he doesn't become a problem again." Tokarev informed. "This should not take too long," he added. Lev merely grunted in response. The facility was barren and eerie. No noise stirred throughout other than the footsteps of the three.

Despite growing old, and spending the majority of time in his power armor, he still took great care in his appearance. He was the leader of the nation, he had a reputation to uphold after all. Yet today seemed to just not be his day. No matter how much gel he used, or how firmly he combed it, his hair would not work with him. He let out a sigh and dropped the comb, it wasn't worth it. He had other important matters to attend to. \n\nAfter a quick meal for breakfast, he was briskly walking through the church to attend a meeting when something caught his eye. It was a crooked painting of himself, with burn marks dotted throughout. He stopped in his tracks, looked around to see if anyone else was near, and then approached it. A wave of nostalgia had hit him, this had been taken during his days of grief. The mean look his face carried concealed the depression that seeped away at his soul. It had been so long, so much had changed. On a whim, he took the painting off the wall and began to walk back. 'The meeting can wait five minutes' he thought to himself as he walked towards his quarters. Once there, he hung the painting up on his wall, surrounded by others he had collected over the years. Paintings of Lydia, the tankers, and Loidminster. He stood back, emotion washing over him. His life had never been easy; many hard choices had to be made. But sometimes, it all seemed clear to him. He took one last glance at it before leaving the room, himself in a better mood than before."

Always a new place to go, always a new training regimen. It exhausted Solomon and so he cherished the quiet whenever he could get his hands on it. Or so he had previously. \n\nLately though, the quiet had come more often. Far too often. The silence that had once been cherished now felt eerie. For months the city had been slowly quieting down, bit by bit, piece by piece until Solomon was left with only deafening silence. He would often ignore his suspicions, rationalizing that he had simply grown so used to the sounds that he could block them out perfectly. It didn't work. \n\nOne day, when the silence grew too loud, Solomon went out to investigate. 'Perhaps they had developed perfect silencing on the Tank's wheels?' He questioned, hoping that his suspicions had been misplaced. Venturing out to his area of the church, he finds that not a soul stirs within it. It was dead silent, with only the sounds of his footsteps to keep him company. A ball of anxiety begins to form within his stomach, frantically searching through the entire church for any sign of life. It was as if the entire world had disappeared and forgotten him. Every room within the church was barren of life, they had all left Solomon on his own. Dark thoughts started to enter his mind, his fear overwhelming his ability to rationalize. He frantically makes his way to a Tank reserve in the south, desperate to confirm his theory. He opens it up and freezes, anxiety coursing through his veins."

"Is there any evidence to suggest Solomon knows what's going on?" Ekaterina asked. "Negative Commander, he's blind to it all." The soldier informed her. "Good. Inform the new arrivals of our next plans. Dismissed." Ekaterina stated. The two soldiers saluted her before turning around. Ekaterina breathed out a sigh and closed her eyes, emotions swirling around in her brain. \n\nShe was nervous, loathe as she was to admit it. Closer and closer they made progress toward their end goal, and despite how well it was going, Ekaterina had to battle with her anxiety and insecurities each time. Her thoughts turned to Lydia, her predecessor. What would she consider all this? Would she support it, or would it disappoint her? Her emotions were starting to get the better of her. She steeled herself. It didn't matter. She was gone. That was that. \n\nEkaterina was running on instinct, the only thing keeping her from running away was her knowledge that the revolution demanded she push forward. It needed a leader, a guide and Solomon had failed in his duties, leaving her to pick up the pieces. She opened her eyes and dispelled her worries. She would not fail, she simply could not.

Thankfully, cooler heads prevailed, both parties' amicable intentions made clear to one another before blood could be shed. By her count, all Chief Warden Sylvia aspired to, was a safe life for the mountain dwellers. \n\nSolomon was more than happy to work with her on that front.

They had gotten overconfident, cocky. Fat off the spoils of being in control that when they had been threatened, they lost the battle. For most of the Wardens, it had broken them. Their morale shattered, simply meandering through life seeking to simply get by, never again dreaming big. Mary held on, for if the Wardens were to break, she would be nothing. This promise, the one thing that had kept fire within Mary's heart had been decimated. She had truly become broken. \n\nShe was forced to watch as Safehaven, the city that had taken her in during her lowest, that she had come to truly care about, was taken over by a hostile force.

And yet, it was always a double-edged sword; For after victory, came negotiation. Ekaterina hated negotiation. Before her were the two most important figures of Safehaven, Mayor Showtime and Mary Mulligan. Showtime was seated down by the desk, while Mary remained standing; her arms crossed behind her back, glaring at Ekaterina. \n\n" Explain to me your terms of negotiation, and be quick about it. I grow increasingly tired of these games." Ekaterina said sternly. Mary snarled at this and stepped forward, stopped by Showtime who stuck out her hand and nodded at Mary, a gentle expression on her face. "It's very simple. We, the people of Safehaven, will cease all resistance efforts against you as well as serve the state if you leave the vault and the city unharmed. We're not unwilling to work together—you just need to leave us alone," Showtime stated. Ekaterina let the words hang for a while, bouncing ideas within her brain. The Wardens were certainly capable and their combat prowess and knowledge could be very useful in the battles to come. But plans had already been drawn up for Safehaven; the construction of a massive tank storage and refueling facility within the vault.

It had been some time since the communists had taken over Safehaven and relations had steadily been improving as the people grew more comfortable with them. For some, however, it proved difficult to get used to things changing. A light knock at the door disturbed Showtime's musing, she muttered a polite enter and waited to see who would enter. In came Mary Mulligan, walking in slowly. Speaking of people who couldn't get used to the communists, Mary was a prime example. Ever since the Warden's defeat she had lost her fire, her drive, replaced by a slow depression that ate her up. 'It would take her time' Showtime said internally, and she would do everything to bring Mary back to her usual self. \n\n" Good morning, Mary. How are you today?" Showtime inquired cheerfully, receiving nothing but a curt "Fine" from Mary. Showtime sighed sadly. "Mary, are you busy right now?" Showtime asked. "Somewhat, but I can make time for you," Mary responded. "Good, come over here for a minute," Showtime said as she gestured towards the window. Mary briskly walked over and looked out. "Wow, it's raining," Mary said sarcastically. "Very funny. Take a look at the houses. Do you see anything that sticks out?" Showtime asked. Mary remained silent, not understanding what she was supposed to be seeing. "It's lights, Mary. How many houses had lights before all this? I know you wish we never lost, I do too. But we did, and now we have to make the best of it. To show the people that they can still go on, that there's something to be gained by working together. We just need to work together, please?"

Fuel was important, not just economically but a key resource for the production and subsequent use of battle tanks. A central refueling hub would prove a great boon to Loidminster's combative capabilities in the battles to come, not to mention how important the storage room would be for alleviating space within their tightly packed cities. This had been the necessary choice and Ekaterina knew it. \n\nAn explosion rang out, disturbing Ekaterina's thoughts. A crane and multiple constructed buildings had been decimated in the ensuing explosion. It seemed the Warden's resistance efforts were still ongoing.

But when she led a squad into the building to investigate the matter, ready for an armed ambush, she realized she could not have been more off the mark. \n\nStaring at them from across the hall were a cabal of purple-skinned, 10ft. tall creatures draped in cloaks and medical robes, their bulging eyes, teeth, and grotesque muscles barely contained by their vaguely humanoid bodies. Every one of them turned to stare at Ekaterina and her men as they entered, with several instantly vanishing from sight within an instant. Uneasy, some of the younger privates readied their weapons, before an elderly, weary-looking nurse came running up to them. "Please! Not in front of the patients!" \n\nThe woman proceeded to take Ekaterina to one side, before recounting the history of the Nightkin housed in the asylum, the tale of The Unity, and the stealth-boy-induced schizophrenia plaguing many of the mutants. Occasionally, the captain would glance over the nurse's shoulder and at her men. Some had mustered the courage to hold uneasy chats with the Nightkin, a few even sheepishly inquiring about their condition. \n\n"Good machine. Powerful." A voice echoed from behind Ekaterina. Standing behind her was a solitary mutant draped in rags, staring at some of the tanks parked outside from behind the window. The nurse chimed in. "Oh that's Lou - he's an absolute peach, occasionally helps us round up troublemakers. He's made great progress lately!" \n\nLou turned to face Ekaterina. "Are you Steel Patriot?" He pulled out an extremely weathered comic book. The captain could just about make out the front page, featuring a stylized, muscled woman in military uniform posing in front of an old-world tank. "Lou big fan. Wants to help uh... 'fight the right fight'. As you say." Ekaterina scanned him from head to toe. As she slowly began to nod, the mutant interjected once more. "Could Lou uh..."

Of the men of the Iron Confederacy butchering and burning their way through the lands of the Canadian People's Front. It was, in a lot of ways, the beginning of the end for the CPF. \n\nEventually, she resumed—"... I think- it's about time for some payback. What do you say?"

All of it. They are no better than you or me." \n\nShe waved a bundle of documents in the air before slamming it down on an adjacent desk. "Take a look for yourselves.

Ekaterina walked up to the King, lowering herself down to eye level before clasping his flaking chin in her hand. "All hail the Great Gunn, King of no-one. Am I right?" She grabbed him by the scruff of the neck, dragging him over to the windowpane to showcase her handywork. Flames as high as the mightiest buildings of Brandon, wreaking havoc amid the once storied capital, the faint screams of civilians echoing down below. \n\nGunn's eyes, long hollowed, came alive for the first time in years. Murmurs leaving his dried lips, as the faintest weeps filled the room. "Enjoy the sight. Really take it in. Maybe it'll get you to realize just how powerless you were all along.

Letting out another cry, he lunged at Ekaterina with a sudden, renewed vigor. But the captain had seen the writing on the wall.

"Likewise Miss Ekaterina. We've done a lot of consideration within Safehaven. We'd..." She left the sentence hanging, Mary's words echoing throughout her mind. Was she making the right decision?

Finger foods and alcoholic drinks were served freely, allowing the event to give off an air of jovial relaxation. Despite the general enjoyment of the people, it was completely unknown as to the reason for the gathering. Of course, Loidminster had changed much over the years, giving plenty of reason to celebrate. But the exact reason as to why the gathering had occurred. The lights dimmed, focusing purely on a great stage; causing the crowd to go silent. Out of the curtains came Ekaterina, looking pleased with herself. She reached towards the microphone and began to speak. \n\n"People of Loidminster. You should be proud of yourselves!" Her voice boomed, causing the crowd to cheer. "Not long ago, we were surrounded. Enemies both internally and externally sought our demise. They tried to break our will. But we beat them!" Ekaterina roared, again being met by fervent cheers. "And yet, sometimes, I feel myself regretting my actions. She said sadly, her smile turning sadder. "We did what we had to do. The clergy had proven their inability time and time again. But, perhaps, we could have found a better way to do things." She said, her eyes staring right through the crowd. "Allowing ourselves to be weighed down by the past. It's a waste of time. But to take lessons from it, one should always strive to do so," she said. She then reached into her pocket and pulled out a remote, she pressed a button that displayed an image on a screen behind her. "Allow me to show you, the newly reconstructed Church of St. Lenin!" She said happily. The crowd clapped, but in truth, Ekaterina didn't care how they reacted. She knew in her heart that this had been the right thing to do; she had come to care about the clergy. She had changed much over the years, different lessons being instilled in her by important figures. At long last, she had learned her final one. \n\n§2Forgiveness.§! \n\nForgiveness for the people that had wronged...""

From what the translators could muster, the United States' occupation of Canada in 2072 sounded the alarm bells at the Kremlin. Some of the old dogs within the Secretariat began throwing around the idea that America was setting up for larger-scale operations in the Pacific. Once the war with China had run its course, they argued, nothing would stand between the US and Russia's backyard. \n\nRecognising this possibility, but also eager to maintain the ongoing détente with Washington, the General Secretary dispatched a single, top-of-the-line nuclear submarine tasked with conducting covert reconnaissance operations along the Canadian coast. The mission was headed by one Commanding Officer Vadim. Among the Soviet navys finest, he had distinguished himself in the Black Sea skirmishes of the late 2050s, quickly climbing the career ladder. Within his quarters, the team was able to recover a handwritten note, perfectly persevered in an air-tight safe underneath the cot: \n\n"24th of October 2077, \n\n18 hours since last communication with headquarters. The explosion has fried our systems. The breach in the hull grows wider. As do their screams. If I were a better man, I would be out there with them. Look them in the eye while we go down together. As a crew. \n\nBut that's not who I am. I have done nothing but stumble my way from promotion to promotion for the past 27 years. A handshake here. A wink there. And all it amounted to is a steel grave thousands of kilometres from home. \n\nI can't do this anymore. They beg and they plead. It keeps getting louder. More desperate.

Natalia's face had gone white from where she sat at Ekaterina's side in her cramped office.\n"I don't think so," the Commander muttered. "Still, we can't afford children spreading dissent on the radios, especially not of this kind. Heads will roll." She let out a low growl, and Natalia leaned back in her chair a little. Ekaterina turned to face her friend and realized Natalia was afraid. Of what, a prank on the radio? No, that... Was Natalia afraid of her? Ekaterina smiled and narrowed her brows. "Want to join me in getting to the bottom of this?" Natalia sat frozen and stared wide-eyed at the Commander. After a moment, Ekaterina shrugged and stood up. "Suit yourself. I'll be back in a few hours. Do try to get some of that paperwork done." She gestured broadly to the mess on the desk and marched out of the room. Bodyguards fell in behind her as she marched, forming a 12-man procession at Ekaterina's heel by the time she left the building. She'd parked her personal vehicle next to the snowdrift outside the office, and...\n"There she is!" A shout came clear from the roof of the building three stories up, and Ekaterina wheeled. Looking up, she saw a lone man at the top of the building holding a flag she'd only ever seen painted on the side of some of the Spear's most veteran tanks—a sickle curling around a maple leaf on a starry yellow backdrop. "Get 'er!" She whirled again and a crowd of bystanders rapidly formed a circle around Ekaterina and her guards. The guards drew their weapons. The crowd brandished a host of blunt weapons between their numbers.\n"Hey, if any of you folks wanna live, I wouldn't stand by the tyrant," one of members of the crowd said to the guards.\nEkaterina watched as the guards' faces flashed with doubt, then with consideration, then with resignation. One by one, each one holstered their weapons and melted into the crowd. "Nothin' personal, boss," the last one muttered to her as he left her side, "but I got a family to feed." Ekaterina watched the crowd carefully. She tried to move her hand to her pistol, but a sudden sharpness bit into her side above its holster. A shot rang out a split second afterwards, and she felt a warm aching spread throughout her torso. She slumped to one knee, pressing her hand to the wound. She would've looked up a moment later were it not for the steel worker with the rotten two-by-four."

There was a light crunch as it brushed up against the snow covering it. Someone was making noise in the distance, but she couldn't exactly tell what they were saying. Nothing moved. It was nice to lie so still, she realized after a moment. Then she wondered why she was lying so still, and she remembered she'd been shot. She waited a moment longer, then thrusted every ounce of energy in her body into the herculean task of opening her eyes. The left eye felt like it was glued shut, but the right eye's lid slowly opened. There was nothing but white. The voice in the distance called out again. "Kathy!?" There was fear in it. Ekaterina grunted; she'd always hated that nickname. Hearing the grunt, she opened her mouth and tried to speak. First a light gurgle emerged—she swallowed down a pool of half-dried blood and saliva and tried again.\n"Over here, Nat." The phrase was barely audible, but she heard a moment of silence followed by urgent footsteps in its wake.\n"Oh my God, what'd they... I..."\n"Got me good." She coughed lightly; that hurt. "I'll live."\nNatalia's face was even whiter than during the radio broadcast earlier. "You sure? Jesus, they did a number on you..." Natalia looked the Commander up and down.\n"That bad, huh?"\n"Yeah."\n"Right." Ekaterina grunted a brief laugh. "Should've seen it coming. Guess the broadcast was real, huh?" Natalia nodded sadly. "Figures. Hey, help me get to a hospital, and if we survive this I'll make 'em pay for what they did to me—to us. Got it?"\n"Mhm." Natalia nodded vigorously, her hand covering her mouth in horror as she continued looking at Ekaterina. After a moment she wrapped her fingers around the Commander's forearms and lifted. Sharp pains shot through every bone in Ekaterina's body and she nearly screamed with the effort it took to force her mind's functionality. A few blindingly painful moments passed before she caught herself hobbling at Natalia's side through the parking lot towards Natalia's car in one of the far spots. Nobody else was present to watch their slow movement. When they reached the car, Ekaterina saw her reflection in the frost-covered windows of the car and nearly puked in disgust; the left side of her face had been savaged and cut to shreds, and massive bruises dotted the right side. After a moment of silent stillness, she let Natalia help her into the car."

nf_loi.1003.d:0 "Ekaterina's eyes felt... Well, she decided after a moment, they didn't quite feel like anything. The right eye was sluggish, but the left eye... Not only did it not want to open, she realized—it couldn't open. What was there to open? She noticed that that was a scary thought, and then she wondered why. The surgery. Of course. Fighting off the drowsiness of the surgeon's sedative, she climbed back up into consciousness and forced her right eye open. There was a sour taste in her mouth. She opened it and stretched the jaw a little; it ached slightly. She turned her head and noticed Natalia asleep in a chair next to the bed. She coughed lightly, and Natalia jolted awake. "Well," Ekaterina muttered, "seems I made it."\nNatalia stared at Ekaterina in shock, a slow smile gracing her mouth. She wiped a pair of tears from her face. "I knew you would, Kathy."\nEkaterina tried to laugh—she ended up coughing more than laughing, but the meaning got across. "I'll get you one of these days. Spreading that nickname all those years ago. God..." She slowly shook her head from side to side as she tried lifting it from the hospital bed's pillow. After a moment she felt the blood returning to her arms and she sat up, propping herself up against the headboard. A red-suited nurse waited patiently in the corner, simultaneously looking relieved and nervous at Ekaterina's awakening. "Mirror?" The nurse nodded shyly and brought a small mirror up to Ekaterina's face. There was a moment of hesitation while the Commander processed the image. Permanent scars by the eye, one leading into the lip, obviously the empty socket—that looked nasty but it'd be a nice bit of showmanship to pull out if respect needed earning. "Could be worse," she muttered while lightly stroking the scars.\n"You were lucky to survive the beating you took," Natalia murmured. "I was worried. We all were. And then you—"\n"How long has it been since I was attacked?" Ekaterina looked around the room for a calendar. The clock on the far wall read half past four, but she couldn't find any dates.\n"It's been a full three months, Kathy. You were in a coma for a few weeks after the initial surgery and you've been bouncing from close call to close call since then."\n"Jesus." Ekaterina shuddered. "Am I still in charge?"\n"Yeah, but the Tanker's Revolt's been getting bad. Lotta people dying in your name, hoping you're still gonna wake up and lead them."\n"Guess I better get to leading then. Too many traitors to deal with." She leaped off the bed and saw stars while her head went momentarily dizzy. The nurse tried to steady her, but Ekaterina held a stern hand to keep her at bay. "No time to lose. I'll take it easy today, but there's a lot to do. Lydia didn't die to see us sitting here moping. On your feet, Nat." With her friend at her side, the Commander shuffled out of the recovery room still wearing the surgery robe around her."

nf_loi.1004.d:0 "Ekaterina inspected the burnt-out shell of what was once the single finest tank in the Spear. It had been seized from a certain Captain Cooper when the Tanker's Revolt had kicked off in the heart of Redmond's former revolutionary capital. The rebellion had declared the creation of a new commune—a short-lived thing called "Alberterra"—trying to simultaneously live off the land through a semi-anarchic social system while still maintaining a military for the express purpose of crushing Ekaterina's formerly united front.\nShe bent down to inspect the treads; shrapnel pierced enough of it that the tank's key source of movement would likely be worth little more than scrap. She stood back up and hoisted herself onto the wreck.\nIt was astonishing just how quickly Alberterra had broken down once they'd had more than a couple weeks to figure themselves out—with an absolute refusal to have any form of authority backing a central government, people didn't know what to do with their time. Having spent so long taking orders from one First Citizen or another, the people of Redmond and its surrounding towns were left completely unprepared for any kind of freedom.\nEkaterina climbed into the tank and steeled herself against the pungent fumes lurking within. A pair of scorched corpses sat in what little remained of the two seats manning the tank's operations. The ammunition rack was nowhere to be found and the place where it should've been bore a large dent in the steel carapace of the vehicle.\nAlberterra's failure to govern had resulted in almost immediate famine—as no farmers in the areas around the city were given mandatory quotas to meet, they began hoarding resources for themselves so they could eat better and have a sense of security. The supply chain broke down and an exodus from the city caused nothing but chaos in the countryside. It wasn't long before even the few idealist politicians in the commune had to admit the failure of their attempt—the ones who might've saved the experiment resigned in shame, and the ones who felt no shame retained control to preserve themselves. By the end of the experiment Redmond greeted Ekaterina's troops with open arms and didn't even flinch when she demanded their leaders' heads.\nIt was a shame so many good tanks were lost in the fight, though. Cooper would miss his old baby. He was notorious in the Spear for keeping his vehicle in tip-top shape, and it was a point of generational pride that he'd kept the old thing running. Although...\n"Well," she muttered to herself as she climbed back out the scorched hatch, "maybe we can fix this one up with spare parts. Cooper'd like that." She smiled at the idea—unusually whimsical for her mind, she admitted, but it would be a nice touch to reward occasional bouts of loyalty."
