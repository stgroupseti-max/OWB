  loi_panzerkampf_desc:0 "Among the old ranks of the CPF none were more famed and feared then the tank brigades. Charging head first into any battle the tank brigades were always able to snatch victory out of the jaws of defeat, how ever bad the odds seemed. Many of the proud tankists protecting Loid to this day trace their days either back to the days of the CPF, or their parents does. Never the less the golden days of the CPF is gone, but even under a new banner the old tankists fight with the same old fiery passion as they once did, keeping defeat at bay."

That was until the bombs fell, and their mission soon became their prison. \n\nTrapped in foreign lands for centuries, our once great cabinet of commanders and advisors has fallen into a den of filthy, feral beasts. Decades of knowledge within their rotted brains, turned to nothing but dust. As such, our operational capabilities are severely weakened. \n\nIt is only through the perseverance of §HSava Dukov§! that we can continue to hold onto our corp. Yet even he feels the bell tolling for him and his slowly fracturing mind. He will continue to give his all for the ministry, no matter how fearful he may be of the consequences."
