  loi_tyrants:0 "Death To Tyrants And Traitors!"
  loi_tyrants_desc:0 "“Comrades, will you stand against those who threaten the Revolution? Who threaten our Paradise and our way of Life? Comrades – WILL YOU STAND WITH ME?”"
  loi_suppliers:0 "The Suppliers Without A Name"
  loi_suppliers_desc:0 "The bulk of the weapons that the Canadian People's Front (CPF) employed against the American invaders were provided by China. And yet another key player skulked in the shadows. A container marooned off the coast here, a few smuggeld goods there, and a handful of provisions disguised as 'foreign aid' for good measures. But amidst all the trinkets and bobbles lied the greatest treasure of them all: tanks."
  loi_doctrine:0 "A Difference In Doctrine"
  loi_doctrine_desc:0 "In the days following the Great War, the CPF quickly seized most of Western Canada, and began readying itself to march on Toronto and Ontario. But the Front would have done well to heed the lessons of history; for it has rarely been kind to empires."
  loi_orthodoxy:0 "Orthodoxy, Communism, Backed By Tanks"
  loi_orthodoxy_desc:0 "Loids Ministry was never expected to be long for this world. It was birthed by a self-proclaimed Patriarch who took it upon himself to lead his people out of Redmond as Moses to Egypt. Even Solomon's most devout followers expected to meet a harsh end, be it at the hands of the frigid cold or the armies of the central committee. But eventualy, despite the impossible odds, they reached their promised land."
  loi_crossing:0 "A Two Way Crossing"
  loi_crossing_desc:0 "Loid's Ministry finds itself at a pivotal crossroad. With the nation grappling with grief and internal discord, a decisive path must be chosen. Will a steadfast new leader emerge to guide Loid's Ministry through its darkest hour, or will the old elite stay in power, deepening the nation's woes through dissent and division?"
  loi_care_for:0 "Care For Thy Neighbour"
  loi_care_for_desc:0 "For all of Solomon’s failures and faltering grip on power in recent times, his devotion to the Ministry remains steadfast. Lydia’s memory might never fully wane – but the Patriarch is willing to gather the strength of spirit necessary to ensure that her hopes, and those of all who came before, are not squandered."
  loi_when_war:0 "When We Were At War"
  loi_when_war_desc:0 "In the crucible of Loid's Ministry, a new chapter unfolds amidst the whispers of revolution. With the nation poised on the brink of change, a young flame emerges to lead the charge. As Ekatarina assumes the reins of power, her revolutionary spirit ignites hope and defiance in equal measure. The stage is set for a bold campaign that will reshape the destiny of Loid's Ministry and its people."
  loi_christian_marxism:0 "Christian Marxism"
  loi_christian_marxism_desc:0 "Communism and Christianity are two sides of the same coin, both philosophies fundamentally rooted in solidarity, mutual aid, and devotion to a greater purpose. Solomon is well aware of this – but it wouldn’t hurt to share this knowledge with the denizens of Loidminster."
  loi_god_lord:0 "The Good Lord Speaks Of Mercy"
  loi_god_lord_desc:0 ""Do not envy the violent or choose any of their ways." - Proverbs 3:31"
  loi_cross_hammer:0 "The Cross And The Hammer"
  loi_cross_hammer_desc:0 "When a munitions depot is built, the Gentle Worker knows he has just created a dozen new jobs for his peers. When a church is constructed, the Faithful Carpenter is aware he has just birthed a refuge for the meek. Wherever he turns, the dweller of Loidminster finds purpose all around."
  loi_love:0 "Love Your Next As Yourself"
  loi_love_desc:0 ""Do not plot harm against your neighbor, who lives trustfully near you." - Proverbs 3:29"
  loi_pray_to_foreman:0 "Pray To Your Lord And Your Foreman"
  loi_pray_to_foreman_desc:0 "For the first time in a long while, Solomon was able to sleep in through the early morning. For the first time in a long while, Solomon felt gripped by genuine fear."
  loi_leaf:0 "The Leaf That Makes The Flower"
  loi_leaf_desc:0 "As Ekatarina and her supporters weave their way through Loidminster's intricate political web, a transformation begins to take hold. Through clandestine machinations and bold displays of leadership, they lay the groundwork for a burgeoning base of support. As whispers of change spread, so too does the tide of popular sentiment, swelling the ranks of those rallying behind Ekatarina's vision for the nation."
  loi_fallen:0 "Honouring The Fallen"
  loi_fallen_desc:0 "Amidst the flurry of preparations for the impending revolution, Ekatarina finds herself grappling with the weight of Lydia's passing. "
  loi_father_gift:0 "Fathers' Gift"
  loi_father_gift_desc:0 "The teachings of the Soviet advisors laid the groundwork for the birth of the CPF. Centuries removed, they continue to steer our future."
  loi_spear:0 "The Spear Of The CPF"
  loi_spear_desc:0 "Ekatarina was a smart woman, certainly intelligent enough to ensure the backing of the tanker leadership for her plan. In the past days and weeks, she had engaged in numerous discussions, persuading many individuals of her vision for Loid's Ministry. The majority were eager to rally behind her cause, while those who hesitated... well, they were silently dealt with."
  loi_wind_blows:0 "The Wind Blows"
  loi_wind_blows_desc:0 "The Tanks of the CPF are one of the most feared assets in the northern wasteland.  And while Ekatarina knew that they alone wouldn’t be enough to topple Solomon and his followers, she knew well enough how important they would become in the upcoming war."
  loi_daughters:0 "Our Fathers' Daughter"
  loi_daughters_desc:0 "The Spear of the CPF was composed of the greatest heroes of the past, with many in the Ministry tracing their lineage back to the original members of the Battalion. Now that we have wrestled away the Clergy's power over the people, we can honour our heroes and the goals they fought for."
  loi_gunpowder:0 "The Sweet Smell Of Gunpowder"
  loi_gunpowder_desc:0 "Even in a blasted wasteland such as this, there are resources that we can use. With the support of the workers, our tanks will be equipped with the highest quality ammunition we can provide. They shall be the sword that pierces the hearts of the enemies of the workers."
  loi_fifth_brigade:0 "Restore The Fifth Brigade"
  loi_fifth_brigade_desc:0 "Among the CPF's tank battalions, Lydia Donskoy's §GCzarskaya§W were known to be the finest of them all, a legacy carried all the way to Loidminster. After her passing, the Ministry's scheming Clergy moved to abolish the corp and any associated honourfics. Lydia's legacy lives on through Ekaterina, the Tankers ready to lay down their lives for whom they view as the reincarnation of the legendary Captain."
  loi_hunt_down:0 "Hunt Down Forgotten Tanks"
  loi_hunt_down_desc:0 "A routine survey expedition returns to our fold with exceptional news."
  loi_vanguard:0 "The People's Vanguard"
  loi_vanguard_desc:0 "Ekaterina wields the unflinching support of much of the Ministry’s armed forces, having worked her way up to a leadership position through naught but the sweat of her own brow. In many ways, she is the living embodiment of the ideas of the revolution and a guiding light for the ambitious young men and women of the Tanker corp."
  loi_battalion:0 "The Death Batallion"
  loi_battalion_desc:0 "Back when their minds were still sharp, the Soviet advisors would speak fondly of their women’s courage and defiance during the bloody years of the legendary Great Patriotic War. What better way to honour their legacy than carrying on their legend in spirit?"
  loi_scavenging:0 "Expanding Scavenging Crews"
  loi_scavenging_desc:0 "Ekaterina has approved the expansion of scavenging expeditions. Moving forward, they will boast double the armed escorts and supplies, ensuring they can stay on the hunt for Old World goodies left behind by the American occupiers for longer."
  loi_state:0 "Socialism In One State"
  loi_state_desc:0 "The North is a devastated wasteland, with any manufacturing pocket being insecure or isolated from large settlements. Loidminster and its surroundings will become the beating heart of a new industrial revolution. If the Soviets could do it, why not us?"
  loi_industralization:0 "Rapid Industralization"
  loi_industralization_desc:0 "If our Motherland is to survive the coming storm we will need to achieve self-sufficiency in food and weapons production. These new policies of collectivization and modernization may undercut our light industry for a time, but are absoloutely essential to ensure the survival of the revolution."
  loi_church:0 "Repurpose The Church's Resources"
  loi_church_desc:0 "The steel foundations and wooden panelling adorning Church properties will be dismantled, used to fuel the foundries enabling the emancipation of workers for a good few months."
  loi_revitilization:0 "Revitalization Of Outer Loidminster"
  loi_revitilization_desc:0 "Even before the Great War, much of Loidminster's city outskirts were vacant and empty. This presents an opportunity to equip the settlemen with a new wave of industry, beginning its transformation into a manufacturing and production hub for the North."
  loi_roads:0 "Rebuilding The Roads"
  loi_roads_desc:0 "An educated public is a productive public. This, in turn, cannot occur without the appropriate infrastructure to ensure the exchange of ideas up and down the nation. "
  loi_agricultural:0 "Agricultural Breakthrough"
  loi_agricultural_desc:0 "With the Clergy drastically weakened, we can finally fully implement the agricultural doctrines imparted by the Soviet advisors. According to them, much of the old USSR used to be sterile, frozen fields, forcing crop farming to evolve into a disciplined and precise art. Much of that applies here too."
  loi_armory:0 "Restore The Freemont Armory"
  loi_armory_desc:0 "In the fires of Freemont were once forged the armaments that would help the CPF drive the occupiers back across the border. With the collapse of the Front, the furnaces fell silent. But with the winds of war blowing once more, Ekaterina has seen it fit to bring the facility back to operational capacity."
  loi_ministry_infra:0 "The Ministry Of Infrastructure"
  loi_ministry_infra_desc:0 "As we look to recapture the CPF’s dream, we will also aim to course correct where appropriate. The lack of attention afforded to internal affairs over the course of the Front’s eastward push is one such area. By ensuring the settlements under our banner are properly connected and serviced, we will foster a more solid launchpad through which to bring our breakaway territories back under the fold."
  loi_bread:0 "Thunderchild's Bounty"
  loi_bread_desc:0 "By shifting manufacturing focus to some our of Eastern settlements, we stand to revive this land long left desolate, driving up internal migration in the process."
  loi_pikes_peak:0 "Pikes Peak Power Station"
  loi_pikes_peak_desc:0 "Pikes Peak sits atop the Saskatchewan estuary, where currents flow fast and the water runs deep. What could be deemed dangerous for an unsupervised child is also a golden opportunity for a settlement in constant need of rationing electricity. For now, makeshift turbines operated manually in shifts will do."
  loi_economic_plan:0 "Introduction Of Economic Planning"
  loi_economic_plan_desc:0 "We have, at last, clawed our way out of the rut that had held our settlements down for so long. What little industry we have managed to establish is fragile and insecure, prone to mechanical faults and operational ineficciencies. But it lays the foundation for more disciplined economic planning. The bombs couldn’t stop us. The cold couldn’t stop us. Why doubt ourselvs now?"
  loi_serve:0 "To Live And Serve The People!"
  loi_serve_desc:0 "Ekaterina struts around Loidminster with flames in her eye and an infectious vigour. How can the men not fall behind someone with such genuine conviction?"
  loi_order:0 "Issuing Our Own Order No 227."
  loi_order_desc:0 "A key tenet of our docterine is our ability to withdraw and re-engage the enemy at will. This approach becomes problematic when the defence of the homeland is at stake, when every piece of land and resource we give up falls into enemy hands. To ensure the men are aware of their duty to hold the line when needed, a new military order shall be introduced to the Codex. §YOrder No 227§W. §GNot One Step Back§W!"
  loi_live:0 "We Live And Die By Your Command!"
  loi_live_desc:0 "Following Ekaterina's ascension to the rank of Captain, we've observed a kind of fervour within our troops not seen since our initial arrival to Loidminster. Every day, more and more men and women show up to the recruitment offices, willing to lay down their life to defend our beloved Motherland!"
  loi_heir:0 "The Successor Of The CPF"
  loi_heir_desc:0 "Against all odds, we stand victorious. No longer are we a fringe faction on the precipe of oblivion; we are, by the grace of combat, the last standing heirs of the Canadian People's Front. But we will reject the decadence that gripped the CPF in its final years. Instead, we shall inherit a different mantle - that of §RThe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics§W - so that we may carry forth the legacy of our forefathers."
  loi_redmond:0 "Return To Redmond!"
  loi_redmond_desc:0 "It will take some time to rid Redmond from the stench of Amy Teresee and her supporters. But it will be worth it – for the children of the heroes who led our pilgrimage to Loidminster will finally be allowed to frolic throughout the streets of our true home."
  loi_survivors:0 "Forgiving The Survivors"
  loi_survivors_desc:0 "There are many in the enemy's fold who would have fought on our side given the chance. Even now, our men are scurrying across Redmond, shouting out for distant cousins and relatives lost during our chaotic escape so many years ago. They all shall be welcomed back with open arms."
  loi_hero:0 "The Heroes Of Canada"
  loi_hero_desc:0 "The Revolution knows no end – but that is not to mean it doesn’t offer any respite. Let us take a moment to celebrate our successes, Comrades. May the heroes who led us to victory forever live on in the hearts and minds of the proletariat."
  loi_toast:0 "A Toast To Our Old Friends"
  loi_toast_desc:0 "On that cold winter night, Ekaterina took a moment to reflect on her achievements – and on those who inspired her to shoot for the stars."
  loi_hymn:0 "The Hymn Of Our Army"
  loi_hymn_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, marching songs have been part of a fighting force. While in the days of old they sang to keep pace or to exclaim their brilliance, our men sing the song of St Katyusha, who awaits the guardians of the workers should they fall in battle. Our soldiers sing and march in unison, for the protection of the proletariat and their home."
  loi_prayers_soldier:0 "A Soldier's Prayers"
  loi_prayers_soldier_desc:0 "Many within our military have grown accustomed to the prayer books provided to them, considering them a comfort and a source of peace. With a few revisions and alterations to emphasise socialist doctrine, our men will remain calm and steadfast in the face of any danger."
  loi_kinder_times:0 "Kinder Times"
  loi_kinder_times_desc:0 "In truth, the Ministry has never known peace since its inception. But the winter cold has a way of filling one’s memory with heaps of impenetrable snow. By emphasising an imagined, idealised past in our announcements to the workers, we offer a purpose, a goal to strive towards. God knows a man needs one to carry on in these frozen wastes."
  loi_tank:0 "Tank Modernization"
  loi_tank_desc:0 "The tank is the cavalry of the modern world, both now and 200 years ago. If it is to remain the shield of the workers, we must adapt the old designs to fit with changes that the Great War brought about. With enough time, our tracks will crush all who oppose the Revolution into dust."
  loi_com:0 "Long Range Communication"
  loi_com_desc:0 "It is important that we remain in contact with our forces on the frontline. The dangers of the wasteland make Runners and Couriers unreliable to maintain communication, and the nature of warfare requires constant updates. Re-establishing telecommunications will certainly give us an edge over the enemies of the workers."
  loi_learning:0 "Learning From The Past"
  loi_learning_desc:0 "There is no need to reinvent the wheel, or in this case, reinvent centuries of military doctrine. Though the world has been changed much by the nuclear fire, the old ways still carry value for our forces. Understanding the tactics of the past will better allow us to fight for the workers of the world."
  loi_turrets:0 "Improved Turrets"
  loi_turrets_desc:0 "It is important that when we fire, our target is destroyed. Rifling our tank barrels will grant us superior accuracy over our enemies, though this will mean that more time and resources must be granted to the workers constructing them."
  loi_shield:0 "Improved Shielding"
  loi_shield_desc:0 "Our tanks are the shields of the workers, and thus it is necessary that they remain unbroken. Integrating titanium into the armour panels will stop all but the strongest of weaponry, though it will increase the costs of the vehicles noticeably."
  loi_storm:0 "A New Kind Of Storm"
  loi_storm_desc:0 "The turrets have been refitted, the chassis have been modernized and the armour has been upgraded. Our next era of warfare is ready to begin, so let them come. Let anyone who dare threaten §RThe Workers Of The World§W come and find out what a tyrant's end looks like."
  loi_master:0 "Imitating The Master"

  ###clergy
  loi_solomon_sweep:0 "The Wakeup Call"
  loi_solomon_sweep_desc:0 "The Lord watches over our Patriarch indeed. Having narrowly escaped an attempt on his life, Solomon looks to draw upon loyalists from within the Clergy and beyond to piece the Ministry back together. That is, for as long as the enemy within allows."
  loi_solomon_convert_fast:0 "With a Heavy Hand"
  loi_solomon_convert_fast_desc:0 "We absolutely cannot afford to pussyfoot around this. The Tankers have committed high treason against the Patriarch and must be defanged before they get another chance to do so.  Those not directly implicated in the coup will be made to join the ranks of their comrades on the ground. Their machines of war, meanwhile, will be dismantled to serve nobler goals."
  loi_solomon_convert_fast1:0 "Dust Off Documents"
  loi_solomon_convert_fast1_desc:0 "In an effort to build onto Dukov’s prototype, Solomon dug through old archives, revealing the location of a depot storing dozens of suits of Power Armour meant for the American occupiers. Some will be reverse-engineered – the rest will serve as the backbone of our brand new Spear."
  loi_solomon_convert_fast2:0 "There Be Squabbles Ahead"
  loi_solomon_convert_fast2_desc:0 "The Lord teaches us that revenge is his to take. But those days, the messages of scripture appeared lost on Solomon’s devotees..."

  loi_solomon_convert_fast3:0 "Turn the Wheel"
  loi_solomon_convert_fast3_desc:0 "Despite its detestable origins, Power Armour is the ultimate legacy of the worker’s spirit, empowering the proletariat to achieve the superhuman feats they were long destined for. At the same time, it allows one to assist comrades easily in the heat of battle, embracing the doctrines of solidarity imparted by our Lord. A more perfect symbiosis we could not ask for."
  loi_solomon_convert_slow:0 "Solomon's Executive Order"
  loi_solomon_convert_slow_desc:0 "There is little doubt that the Tankers are behind the attempt on the Patriarch’s life. This makes our situation precarious, as the men and women of the Spear form the backbone of our military and boast the reputation to boot. It is key that their position and status within the Ministry be weakened before we take action."
  loi_solomon_convert_slow1:0 "Secure Stability"
  loi_solomon_convert_slow1_desc:0 "Mere months following the assassination attempt, the Patriarch is already pacing up and down the streets of Loidminster, checking in on the faithfuls and hearing out their grievances. A bold display of leadership that the denizens of the Ministry are sure to appreciate."
  loi_solomon_convert_slow2:0 "Downplay Ministerial Failures"
  loi_solomon_convert_slow2_desc:0 "In his tours of the capital, Solomon has made sure to deflate concerns regarding future attacks on the city as much as possible. He had extended guard patrol routes and was personally following up on leads to subvert other hostile actors. No harm would come to the Ministry ever again – at least, that was the hope."
  loi_solomon_convert_slow3:0 "Inexperienced Tankers"
  loi_solomon_convert_slow3_desc:0 "Solomon has it on good authority that the newer Tanker recruits were not involved in the treasonous plot. This show of loyalty shall not go unrewarded. The eager rookies will be put in charge of whatever remains of the Spear, undercutting the influence of the veterans in the process."
  loi_solomon_convert_meetup:0 "All Quiet"
  loi_solomon_convert_meetup_desc:0 "The guns fall silent both home and abroad. The justice that has eluded the treasonous Tankers for so long can finally be delivered." #used to be dynamic

The ruffians of the wastes are sure to leave us be, as we continue working and toiling for a better tomorrow for the Lord’s flock."

  loi_dagger1_desc:0 "We are all but surrounded by factions birthed from the collapse of the CPF. Until now, we were content in letting them wallow in their own destitution. But with war on the horizon, we cannot afford to sit idly by, and have issued an intelligence gathering operation to ensure we are prepared for what is ahead."

  loi_solomon_left1:0 "Formally Recruit the Believers Milita"
  loi_solomon_left1_desc:0 "With Solomon’s devotees growing in number by the day, it only made sense to formalise the militia into a proper fighting force. Granted, many had never seen war, spending most of their lives toiling the fields – their combat skills reflected that. But if Christ the Lord could make something out of beggars and lowlives, Solomon was more than confident in the potential of honest, hard-working men and women."
  loi_solomon_left2:0 "Necessities of the Modern Age"

  loi_solomon_left3_desc:0 "As newly trained batches of troopers leave the barracks and veterans return from the front, the need to rely on salt-of-the earth, inexperienced farmers lessness. As we finalise the process of revitalising our army, we would do best to sideline the Believer’s Militia... for now."

  loi_solomon_left5_desc:0 "By relying on more analog weaponry, we harness the innate strength of comrades who have been partaking in manual labour ever since they could walk.  A true symbiosis of faith and rigour – what more could be asked of a soldier?"
  loi_solomon_left6:0 "Recruit The Ministerial Guard"
  loi_solomon_left6_desc:0 "Having addressed the immediate shortcomings of our standing army, we can turn to longer-term security concerns.

  loi_solomon_right4_desc:0 "As luck would have it, some of the scavengers were able to recover a handful of scrap electronics found within an abandoned factory on the edge of the Great Breach. It’s not much, but it will help keep the lights on in Loidminster this winter."

  loi_fine_jewel_desc:0 "By combining the Commune’s achievements, few and far between as they may be, with our own, we have grown into something greater than the sum of its individual parts. A true industrial launchpad from which to spread our Revolution to the wider North. We will not rest until we see this dream through – one way or another."
  loi_solomon_pa_integrated:0 "The Backseated Approach"
  loi_solomon_pa_integrated_desc:0 "Why shed the blood of the flock when the North has no shortage of righteous warriors willing to die for a cause greater than themselves? Well - so long as one has the coin anyway. Luckily for the Ministry, that has been in high supply lately, and will be the fuel of the professional shield wall coating our frontier."
  loi_solomon_integrated1:0 "Onboard Battleford"
  loi_solomon_integrated1_desc:0 "The men and women of Battleford have made a living by pointing their guns at the people who first trained them to hold them properly. Dangerous bed fellows maybe, but undeniably efficient ones nevertheless, who we can keep in check with the right level of investment."

  loi_solomon_integrated2:0 "The Department of Vanguard Affairs"
  loi_solomon_integrated2_desc:0 "As we have moved to outsource much of our defence to outsiders, it only makes sense to begin archiving the knowledge brought in alongside these hired guns. Should we ever cut them loose, their experiences will live on through us still."
  loi_solomon_integrated3:0 "Lessons From The South"
  loi_solomon_integrated3_desc:0 "With the Department of Foreign Relations now properly up and running, we can afford to be a little more ambitious. The Patriarch has authorised a broadcast that is expected to travel as far South as the United States. Those ready to make that pilgrimage will be onboarded immediately – their devotion to the cause would be demonstrated in their travels alone."
  loi_solomon_integrated4:0 ""Your Friendly Mercenary Company""
  loi_solomon_integrated4_desc:0 "If you can intimidate the enemy before clashing on the battlefield, you have already won. Solomon had read it in a book once. Or maybe a pamphlet. It had been a while..."
  loi_solomon_integrated5:0 "Highly Desired Upgrades"
  loi_solomon_integrated5_desc:0 "Months on from our decision to begin onboarding mercenary companies, our ranks have well and truly swelled. Sellswords from all over the continent mingle throughout the Ministry, merging into an experienced and diverse standing force worth significantly more than the sum of its parts."
  loi_solomon_integrated8:0 "Power Armor To the People"
  loi_solomon_integrated8_desc:0 "Should all else fail, should every single hired mercenary turn and flee in the face of an insurmountable threat, the Ministry is going to require one last line of defence. Power Armour had already saved Loidminster once before. Should the need arise, it would be called upon to do so again."
  loi_solomon_pa5:0 "Putting Down A Tyrant"
  loi_solomon_pa5_desc:0 "With Redmond fully pacified and any and all pretenders dealt with, we turn our attention to the demon who started it all. Who ushered in the end of the Front. And who would have, in another life, not hesitated to put Loidminster’s men, women and children to the gallows. The CPF’s last Chairwoman, Amy Teresee."
  loi_solomon_pa6:0 "Reopen the Redmond-Northend Line"
  loi_solomon_pa6_desc:0 "Having acquired full control of the Western ends of the Saskatchewan River, the Ministry finds itself in an excellent position to control commercial flows up and down the stream. Through skilful diplomacy, the Patriarch has succeeded in leveraging favourable terms from the independent traders looking to ship goods between the Rockies and the Manitoban region."
  loi_solomon_pa7:0 "Such A Waste Of Money"
  loi_solomon_pa7_desc:0 "Deep underneath Redmond lies a vault left untouched. Disappointigly, its halls are spoiled, nothhing of value abound but hunks of junks and Old World electronics. Good enough to help patch a few groaning pieces of machinery – but little else."
  loi_solomon_pa8:0 "The Importance Of Heavy Arms"
  loi_solomon_pa8_desc:0 "The importance of supporting weaponry can not be understated. By comparing design models found across the region, we can decide on the most effective ones to make standard amongst our forces."

  loi_solomon_pa_new_spear:0 "The New Spear"
  loi_solomon_pa_new_spear_desc:0 "The people of the Ministry are few in number. They will have to make up for it in sheer strength. For a single man with Power Armour can take on one hundred without. Any soldier caught without their suit on business hours is to be kicked off the force effective immediately."
  loi_solomon_spear1:0 "The Department Of Specialized Warfare"
  loi_solomon_spear1_desc:0 "New times call for new strategies, and new strategies call for new standardisation. Luckily for us, we are well-adept in the art of bureaucracy."
  loi_solomon_spear2:0 "Blood And Steel"
  loi_solomon_spear2_desc:0 "Low-quality pre-war rifles may have sufficed in the critical days of the Four Front War. Now however, we cannot afford to equip our men with weapons that could easily snap in half when gripped by power gloves. Whilst this decision means cutting down on the number of soldiers we can field even further, it also means the ones on the frontlines can fight with greater confidence in their equipment’s longevity."
  loi_solomon_spear3:0 "Full Bore"
  loi_solomon_spear3_desc:0 "Not one man can faithful should fall in battle, not when manpower is such a precious commodity up in the North. Dukov and her assistants are hard at work deivising refinements to our existing Power Armour designs to develop suits capable of withstanding extended exposure to gunfire. As though one would need to clear a bunker, with no route of escape - other than total victory."
  loi_solomon_spear4:0 "Crave For Strength"
  loi_solomon_spear4_desc:0 "Slower, bulkier and more difficult to produce – but with the kind of firepower that could punch a hole straight through a Soviet tank. A compromise the Patriarch was more than willing to make."
  loi_solomon_spear5:0 "What Was Theirs is Now Ours"
  loi_solomon_spear5_desc:0 "The programme is already bearing fruit, with dozens of new experimental suit based off of the Imperialist forces' designs rolling off the assembly line. Whilst not quite at the level Dukov envisioned, she is confident she can build off of these prototypes even further."
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet2:0 "Reinstate The Penitentiary"
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet2_desc:0 "Green Court once served as a correctional facility for the enemies of the revolution – under the leadership of the Strathcommune, it turned into little more than a slaughterhouse for dissidents. But the Lord teaches us that every lost lamb is capable of returning to course.  The Penitentiary will be reinstated, and any an all in need of re-education will work through their sins with the sweat of their brow."
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet3:0 "The Old Stomping Ground"
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet3_desc:0 "Redmond was the beating heart of the Strathcommune, and as could be expected, the residents within are hard-pressed to put their faith in turncoats. In an attempt to win their trust, the Patriarch has sent for a shipment of supplies from Loidminster, starting with the industrial heartlands North of the river..."
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet4:0 "Redmond's Reintegration"
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet4_desc:0 "...Before moving on to the residential boroughs of the South."
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet5:0 "From Decadence's Clutches"
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet5_desc:0 "Every street throughout the Ministry’s cities used to be littered with ruffians looking to prey on the vulnerable. But no more. The men have done a commendable job rounding up these troublemakers and shipping them off to the penitentiary. Here, God willing, they will come out the other side as better men."
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet6:0 "Giving Back"
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet6_desc:0 "Over the past few years, Loidminster has grown prosperous. Some of the dwellers have been sighted roaming the streets adorned with jewellery and clean, pre-war outfits. But how could that ever be just when the breadwinner in Whitecourt has to skip meals to make sure their children don’t long for bread? The good Lord teaches one to love thy neighbour – it is about time we take that lesson to heart."
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet7:0 "Weather The Storm"
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet7_desc:0 "A cold wind was brushing from down South, sending shivers down Solomon’s spine..."
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet8:0 "Into The Breach"
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet8_desc:0 "With several members of the Clergymen spread across the Ministry to implement the various policies ordained by the Patriarch, the centre has been left exposed. Reynauld was quick to take notice, and approached Solomon with a proposition..."
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet9:0 "A Job Well Done"
  loi_clergy_cleanup_allquiet9_desc:0 "All around the Ministry, the clergymen are shunned. Who are these pretenders, sitting pretty atop their ivory thrones while the men toil the field. No. It is Solomon that the people want. A man not afraid to spend an afternoon working the assembly line or holding mass in the roughest part of town. A true son of God. A true Patriarch."
  loi_solomon_foreign_relations:0 "The Department Of Foreign Relations"
  loi_solomon_foreign_relations_desc:0 "Among the numerous matters neglected by the Ministry over the course of our administrative slumber is our interactions with the folks living outside the CPF’s former sphere of influence. Many dread the return of the Front, having been raised on horror stories of the organization’s atrocities. The onus is on us to redeem our name, and make Redmond into the force for good it always intended to be."
  loi_solomon_relations_bgr1:0 "An Empty CASKET"
  loi_solomon_relations_bgr1_desc:0 "Hopeful that the Grande Prairie Robobrain facility has no more surprises in store, Solomon has moved to authorise a formal peacekeeping operation across the city and its surroundings, so that the technology within may be repurposed for more noble ends."
  loi_solomon_relations_bgr2:0 "Bright Lights, Brighter Minds"
  loi_solomon_relations_bgr2_desc:0 "Rumors of junkbots roaming the wastes travel fast across the Ministry, drawing in daredevils and academics in equal measure. Whilst the threat of the bots has by and large subsided, this interest is something we can capitalise on. Already, the Patriarch has mandated that anyone with the right qualifications be given exclusive access into the once accursed facilities."
  loi_solomon_relations_whc1:0 "Return To Whitecourt"
  loi_solomon_relations_whc1_desc:0 "Let us unpack our bags, my weary children. The rightful owners have made their return. "
  loi_solomon_relations_whc2:0 "More Than Frontier Justice"
  loi_solomon_relations_whc2_desc:0 "The North is an unforgiving place, where might rules and good intentions are crushed under the weight of man’s cruel ambition. For the longest time, a place such as this begged fathers and mothers to take justice in their own hands. No more, says the Patriarch. Even the worst devils can be redeemed, a duty that falls squarely on Solomon's shoulders. He would not rest until he saw this crusade through."
  loi_solomon_relations_com1:0 "Setup The Occupation Zone"
  loi_solomon_relations_com1_desc:0 "A growing number of independent traders are showing up to Solomon’s residence, blowing up in the Patriarch’s face over alleged attacks on cargos moving in and around Red Deer’s surroundings. That will not do. Not if the Ministry is to uphold the good name it's building for itself."
  loi_solomon_relations_com2:0 "Mightier Than The Sword"
  loi_solomon_relations_com2_desc:0 "Whilst the insurgent groups haven’t been totally squashed yet, the largest among them are coming to realise which way the wind is blowing. The Patriarch has authorised an open back-door policy to his office, so that any would-be collaborator can confidently come forward to lay down their arms."
  loi_allquiet_outcome:0 "Fate of the Tankers"
  loi_allquiet_outcome_desc:0 "The tankers trace their roots back to the birth of the CPF itself. Many of those institutions, along with their associates, stayed in Redmond when Lydia’s contingent made its exodus to Loidminster. We will deal with them in kind."
  loi_solomon_industry_left2:0 "The Revolution's Consequences"
  loi_solomon_industry_left2_desc:0 "Growth begets more growth. As workshops continue to spring up across Vermillion, more and more once retired specialists flock to the city, setting up independent commercial activities to support existing businesses. A cycle of prosperity Solomon was more than happy to support."
  loi_solomon_industry_left3:0 "Calling In A Favor"
  loi_solomon_industry_left3_desc:0 "After some arm-twisting and more than a little bit of pleading on Solomon’s part, Dukov has agreed to run workshops with some of the younger labourers employed in the munitions factories. She has agreed to pass down some of the tricks of the trade, ensuring her knowledge is preserved for future generations."
  loi_solomon_industry_left4:0 "Reintroduce Arms Exports"
  loi_solomon_industry_left4_desc:0 "Solomon has no love for violence, but as the Ministry lacks abundant natural resources, jobs in arms and munitions production are one of the few routes his people have to escape poverty. The Patriarch has agreed to take this one step further, engaging in talks with delegations from across the North to identify suitable and moderately well-intentioned folks to sell these goods to."
  loi_solomon_industry_left5:0 "Vermilion's Re-revolution"
  loi_solomon_industry_left5_desc:0 "Amid all the impressive constructions erected in Vermillion over the past few months, a very simple, but essential one has been neglected until now: a water well. A new one was just dug out in the centre of town, made easily accessible to the various factory workers scattered across the settlement. A symbol of the new life flowing through its veins."
  loi_solomon_industry_middle_opening:0 "A Century Of Negligence"
  loi_solomon_industry_middle_opening_desc:0 "For too long have Solomon’s eyes been closed shut, whether in pursuit of the CPF’s agenda or to look after the people of Loidminster in their time of need during the immediate aftermath of the Front’s collapse. Finally, at his lowest point – he felt wide awake."
  loi_solomon_industry_middle1:0 "The Department Of Renovation"
  loi_solomon_industry_middle1_desc:0 "Under the CPF’s leadership, general wellbeing was sacrificed on the altar of military and industrial efficiency. An evidently unsustainable approach that Solomon would seek to rectify, diverting heavy industry production to ensure readier accessibility of essential goods."
  loi_solomon_industry_middle2:0 "Marwayne's Misuse"
  loi_solomon_industry_middle2_desc:0 "Just because an arm of the state is preoccupied with looking after the people’s day-to-day wellbeing, it doesn’t have to come at the expense of our economy. The Department of Renovation will be expanded to incorporate training workshops tackling the refinement of raw materials, so that the Ministry’s dwellers may continue their learning during their off-hours."
  loi_solomon_industry_middle3:0 "Our Slice Of Paradise"
  loi_solomon_industry_middle3_desc:0 "Efficiency might not always be everything, but it becomes imperiative when the people’s happiness is at stake. By automating some of the Department’s administrative functions, we’ll be able to boost output and thus overall life satisfaction across the Ministry."
  loi_solomon_industry_middle4:0 "Reconstructing Greatness"
  loi_solomon_industry_middle4_desc:0 "Having equipped the Department of Renovation with the tools to succeed, Solomon is set to launch a larger-scale operation tackling the reconstruction of the CPF’s greatest landmarks. Not everything was rosy in the back-when times, but even a grim past can evoke a warm feeling of nostalgia when viewed through the right lenses."
  loi_solomon_clergy_preallquiet1:0 "The State Of Affairs"
  loi_solomon_clergy_preallquiet1_desc:0 "Solomon muscled his way past his aides, before squeezing into the office and shutting the door behind him. His mind would need to be clear to work through the problem at hand."
  loi_solomon_clergy_preallquiet2:0 "Friends In Need"
  loi_solomon_clergy_preallquiet2_desc:0 "Solomon succeeded in singling out a few of the Clergy’s more malleable members, securing a grant for the establishment of a couple recreational centres within the Ministry. All work and no play makes a worker a dull boy after all."
  loi_solomon_clergy_preallquiet3:0 "Restart The Rehab Centers"
  loi_solomon_clergy_preallquiet3_desc:0 "The cold atrophies the senses and rots one’s judgement. We must do what we can to support these wayward souls."
  loi_solomon_clergy_preallquiet4:0 "The CPF's Honeypot"
  loi_solomon_clergy_preallquiet4_desc:0 "We have finally gotten around to sifting through the records requisitioned by the tankers during the initial exodus from Redmond. These contain key findings archived by the old CPF’s R&D divisions over the decades that are sure to give us a leg-up in future industrial and military developments."
  loi_solomon_clergy_preallquiet5:0 "Tackle Corruption Head On"
  loi_solomon_clergy_preallquiet5_desc:0 "Having cleared out a few of the niggles on Solomon’s actions, the path is clear to undertake an initial reform of the Clergy’s structure. This will be a long, tedious, and potentially bloody process, but one we must face head-on if we are to strengthen the Ministry’s foundations for the generations to come."
  loi_solomon_industry_right2:0 "Past Mistakes"
  loi_solomon_industry_right2_desc:0 "Wainwright began as nothing more than a large industrial pit, commuters spending hours every day just to get to their place of work and back. By building more housing, we will lay the groundwork for the kind of thriving consumer economy the settlement desperately needs."
  loi_solomon_industry_right3:0 "Picking Up The Slack"
  loi_solomon_industry_right3_desc:0 "Inertia by itself won’t suffice. Wainwright is going to need bigger and better subsidies if it is to blossom into something truly special."
  loi_solomon_industry_right4:0 "Expanding Markets"
  loi_solomon_industry_right4_desc:0 "If the worker grows tired of the smog and the thumps of pistons and other industrial machinery, he should always have the option to settle the countryside for a quieter life of honest farmwork. "
  loi_solomon_industry_right5:0 "Wainwright's Re-revolution"
  loi_solomon_industry_right5_desc:0 "On the day Solomon paid a visit to Wainwright’s new town centre, he laid eyes on something never before seen roaming the streets of the city; a family with young kids."
  loi_solomon_industry_meetup:0 "Back To Business"
  loi_solomon_industry_meetup_desc:0 "The Patriarch had breathed new life in the Ministry’s cities; he had tackled deep-rooted corruption with God-given conviction; and he had offered a new lease on life to the meek. Whatever else the Lord had planned for him, he would stand ready to deliver."
