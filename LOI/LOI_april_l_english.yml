nf_loi_april.1.d:0 "Streaking across the sky like a red stain is some kind of comet. The leaders of Loid's Ministry stop bickering for a bit to consider their options. They know it made impact somewhere nearby, but the more superstitious members of the community want to leave the crash site alone citing bad omens. They are convinced that it is a sign that the end is nigh or that it is a precursor of some danger. The leaders of the Ministry..."
nf_loi_april.1.a:0 "...Ignore the pleas and send a party to investigate."
nf_loi_april.1.b:0 "...Leave the asteroid to it's fate."

nf_loi_april.2.t:0 "RED ALERT!"
nf_loi_april.2.d:0 "A communist Ghoul in a rocket who doesn't know he should be dead has crash landed back in the midst of Loid's Ministry today. Rather than doing the logical thing and just shooting the stupid bastard once and for all, the faithful of Loid's Ministry have declared him a messianic figure destined to spread the light of communism across the wasteland. The wasteland holds its breath and waits to see what becomes of this new tyrant."
nf_loi_april.2.a:0 "The end is nigh!"

nf_loi_april_openers.1.d:0 "At every turn, I've been betrayed by capitalists and lesser men. The Soviet Union has fallen. Not due to some grand final stand but rather due to the corrupting influence of capitalism.  I have a plan for me to escape like I always do. One final jump through the timelines.  Scientists loyal to me say that there is enough for one final jump. Not to kill Einstein this time, but rather just to escape this mess. I need to make the escape convincing. I need to escape to the one place uncorrupted by capitalism. Because as long as there is two people in any given place, some kind of capitalist exchange has taken place there. Space. There is no one living in space. The question isn't whether or not I will be able to escape into the space of a different timeline, but rather only what I should bring with me."
nf_loi_april_openers.1.a:0 "Bring my most loyal followers, for the most valuable resource we have is men."
nf_loi_april_openers.1.b:0 "Bring advanced technologies, for the most valuable resource we have is science."

nf_loi_april_openers.2.t:0 "Private Log of Soviet Premiere Cherdenko #419"
nf_loi_april_openers.2.d:0 "The success of our space commune is as temporal as it was inevitable. We have officially run out of resources up here. We need to land once more onto the planet in order to try and gather up the resources necessary to return.  We have selected North America as a point of landing due to the fact that some time ago we observed nuclear apocalypse occurring on this planet. Hopefully, we will be able to find the resources necessary easily, as there is no way that the capitalists will have returned so easily."
nf_loi_april_openers.2.a:0 "Perhaps we can even rule there."
nf_loi_april_openers.2.b:0 "We return only to leave once more."

nf_loi_april_openers.3.t:0 "Private Log of Soviet Premiere Cherdenko #420"
nf_loi_april_openers.3.d:0 "Nuclear apocalypse has clearly favoured the communist agenda. The moment I landed on the planet, there were hundreds of pliable communist minds to greet me. many men and women who hated the ephemeral idea, the memory of the stars and striped flag. Capitalism and all of its trappings were naturally abhorrent to these patriotic souls. However, there were a few small issues. Many within this settlement subscribed to the opiate of the masses. This concept of. Christianity or an offshoot of it that combines communism with this idea of faith. I once considered this incompatible in any good Soviet society. However, they also appear to believe me to be some kind of Messiah. Spreading communism all across the wasteland.  They wish to do some kind of ceremony to honour me in their church this day. All of the ones who believe in this farce are in one place. How can I use this to my advantage?"
nf_loi_april_openers.3.a:0 "This misconception could be useful."

nf_loi_april.3.t:0 "Private Log of Soviet Premiere Cherdenko #435"
nf_loi_april.3.d:0 "There has been a wrinkle in my plans. Turns out that there is some kind of lesser communist leader here. A mad woman. Quite naturally, for someone of her stature, she is inherently lesser. She believes in Chinese agrarian communism rather than the truth. Simply put? She should be easy to put down like the Mad Dog she is. The only question is, should I play along for now and bide my time while I gather more resources from our space commune? Or should I strike while the iron is hot, while she doesn't know what to make of me, when she least expects it? Patience is a virtue, but for right now, I believe that we know more about her than she knows about me. But then again, I don't know if I am currently in the position to strike her down."
nf_loi_april.3.a:0 "Strike suddenly and swiftly; surprise is on our side."
nf_loi_april.3.b:0 "Patience is a virtue. We need a thorough plan."

nf_loi_april.4.t:0 "Private Log of Soviet Premiere Cherdenko #480"
nf_loi_april.4.d:0 "This war was less swift and less successful than I expected. However, we did survive, and now we control even more territory. I need to strike quickly to try to secure the resources for my return to my space commune. I fear that while I have been absent, others have supplanted me. Or even worse. My most loyal followers have finally run out of resources completely and killed one another off. I need to rock it back there in order to either return stronger than ever with the entire commune, or enough resources for our little experiment to continue for a while. The only question is how. We have no method of rocketry in this shithole and developing the prerequisite technology required will take too long. Hopefully, it will pay to have patience for a little longer. there is always scavenging this little wasteland of everything that it is worth."
nf_loi_april.4.a:0 "We wait, but more importantly, we plan. Time is on my side."

nf_loi_april.5.t:0 "Private Log of Soviet Premiere Cherdenko #499-1"
nf_loi_april.5.d:0 "The capture of the land area above Yellowstone national park has led to certain opportunities. With only a little bit of industrial development this has the potential to be developed into makeshift rocket fuel. We would just need some actual factories and some of the prerequisite technology. I have the influence to try and force one or the other through more quickly, but is having the technology to make jet fuel more important, or having the industry?"
nf_loi_april.5.a:0 "Factories make more than just jet fuel, they make bullets as well."

nf_loi_april.6.t:0 "Private Log of Soviet Premiere Cherdenko #499-2"
nf_loi_april.6.d:0 "Feelers sent out have supposedly found a rocket to take me into space in Manitoba! Rumors say it was a commercial vessel lost before the world met it's end. It is a damaged thing, however it is the proper metal, and it is repairable. Soon I will return to the stars and the rest of my station. But what to do when I get there? This wasteland world is ripe for the domination of true communism. But I swore to my most loyal followers that we would make my empire among the stars. My return is inevitable, but what should I prepare to do after?"
nf_loi_april.6.a:0 "I will return to the stars and leave this planet."

nf_loi_april.8.d:0 "My plan has... failed. Again. Upon testing the new atomic fuel components derived from the technology found in Yellowstone with the rocket we recovered from Manitoba, both exploded upon liftoff. All of the resources that went into its production, all of the time spent researching... WASTED! Worst of all I have not heard from my followers beyond the blue wall of this sky, the prison of this gravity. I fear that I may have taken too long in trying to reach them. I fear that they have all died, or worse moved on without me. Perhaps it is time to give up… maybe I talk about space too much. \n\nMaybe I should cut back. \n\nI need to stop with that shit. I am perfect! Space is fucking cool! And even if my followers have died or worse abandoned the cause I will not give up on my communist utopia beyond the stars even if I have to kill every single miserable person in this wasteland to do it! I will get to the only place uncorrupted by capitalism!"

nf_loi_april.9.d:0 "The worst part of being a ghoul is being unable to have children of your own. Having all the time in the world but having no one to truly share it with. After capturing the reservation, Anatoly has potentially found the very thing that he has been looking for. A way to have children of his own. This world has given him everything now. A new purpose, a new nation, and now? A new son."

nf_loi_april.10.t:0 "Private Log of Soviet Premiere Cherdenko #690"
nf_loi_april.10.d:0 "A warping of the air happens behind Soviet Premier Cherdenko as an elderly voice calls out to him: “You really thought you could get away with messing with the time stream this much, didn't you Anatoly?” Cherdenko's blood runs cold as he turns. Behind him stands Albert Einstien with a gun pointed straight at his head. “You are not the only one with a time machine my friend.” \n\nAnatoly pulls out a gun of his own and points it directly back at Albert Einstien. “I already killed you! I already killed you! How are you here?” \n\n“You killed the me of your timeline. Now you have invaded mine and you will pay the price.” \n\nA gunshot rings out throughout Anatoly's office and a single body drops as Einstein falls go the ground. Cherdenko calls for a crew to clean up the mess that had been made only to find his body gone upon reentering the office. \n\nOnce he had sat down, he could hear yet another warping noise coming from his restroom, but chose not to investigate."

nf_loi_april_commanders.1.t:0 "General Nikolai Krukov"
nf_loi_april_commanders.1.d:0 "Good help is truly hard to find these days. After I staged an assassination attempt that Krukov allegedly performed, I felt as though I had finally consolidated power. In reality I did not realize until I had left for space that I had betrayed perhaps my only true friend and the only other true Soviet patriot in all the world. \n\nI decided that I could rebuild him. Faster. Stronger. Smarter. His flesh was weak, but through the power of space science, I have made him strong. And he remains so loyal to me that he followed me to the wasteland surface of what used to be known as the Canadian Plains. The only question now is what to do with him..."
nf_loi_april_commanders.1.a:0 "He serves me better as a battlefield commander."

nf_loi_april_commanders.2.d:0 "Dasha is one of my greatest assets in regards to Soviet intelligence. Back in the third world war of my timeline, she served as my greatest intelligence organizer, and my most loyal follower. It always pleased me to hear her call me your excellency, a particular quirk that only she had. When it came to the ghoulification that made me immortal, of course I had the foresight to make her into one as well. \n\nShe is completely loyal to me and the ideals of the Soviet Union to the point that she has followed me to the surface of this wasteland. The question is, how does she best serve me?"
nf_loi_april_commanders.2.a:0 "She is a genius when it comes to Fabian Tactics."

nf_loi_april_commanders.3.t:0 "Natasha Volkova"
nf_loi_april_commanders.3.d:0 "There was never one Natasha Volkova. It was always a title like Soviet Premier or James Bond. A title given to the best Female Soviet Commando sent on all the most dangerous missions. The tradition continues to this day. \n\nOne of the women in my new burgeoning Soviet State has proven to be the best shot with a rifle, able to survive days out in the wastes with no aid. But most of all she has shown the prerequisite cruelty to get what needs to be done done. She has proven to be a more valuable asset than just her gun, but how to best utilize her?"
nf_loi_april_commanders.3.a:0 "She has more value in training the next generation of Soviet Women"
nf_loi_april_commanders.3.b:0 "She serves us better as a battlefield general."

LOI_APRIL_CURRY_DESC:0 "The One and Only. \n\nRadicalized by the Soviet government's willingness to work with the United States during the Soviet restoration of 20XX, Anatoly chose to escape to the one place that had not been corrupted by capitalism: Space. \n\nHaving stolen a Soviet spacecraft for his plan, he and his loyal detatchment sought to commandeer one of the three soviet space stations orbiting the planet. Once successful they would live out the rest of their days in a paradise floating among the stars, even debating on an invasion of the moon. This all came to a head when shortly after their plan succeeded, the world errupted in nuclear fire.\n\nThey lived out their fantasy for a time, but as the years passed and nobody on board was qualified to handle the station's nuclear reactors, everyone either died or ghoulified. After the original ship was found to be in critical condition, they would invade the closest one out of the two remaining ships, and after they continued to neglect the repairs needed, that one would soon too need to be replaced. \n\nHaving exhausted all other options, you'd think they would handle their last resort with more care, but no. When the third and final station started to show signs of failing, Anatony decided to lead an expedition down to the planet himself to search for the replacements needed to repair it.\n\nHow does a centuries old ghoul manage to say so fresh and clean? Why the greatest minds of the Volvograd institute of prosthetics are to thank!"
