  # NCR Early Events
  ncr_early.1.t:0 "Vault 13's Hero"
  ncr_early.1.d:0 "When Shady Sands was but a budding settlement, plagued by raiders and locked in a bitter struggle for survival, it was visited by a denizen of Vault 13. Known only as the \"Vault Dweller\", he met with Aradesh, who shared their knowledge with him on his quest to replace Vault 13's faulty water chip. While the water chip from Vault 15 (Shady Sands' home vault) was piled too far under rock for the Vault Dweller to recover, Aradesh's kindness made the Vault Dweller feel indebted to the struggling community. When disaster struck Shady Sands and Khan raiders captured Aradesh's daughter Tandi, the Vault Dweller repaid his debt ten times over, freeing Tandi and driving the Khans from the California for decades. \n\nOur run-in with the Vault Dweller's kindness and honour was a founding moment for the Republic, as without his bold assault on the Khans and freeing of Tandi our fledgling nation would never have taken off from the ground. Over the centuries after his visit, the Vault Dweller's impact on Shady Sands would morph into the settlement's founding myth. Society would be forever morphed, but by what fundamental ideal?"
  ncr_early.1.a:0 "Debts must always be honoured, no matter the cost."
  ncr_early.1.b:0 "Strangers must always be treated with kindness."
  ncr_early.1.c:0 "Self-sacrifice is essential to help others."
  ncr_early.1.e:0 "Shady Sands outgrew revering a single figure long ago!"
  ncr_early.2.t:0 "The Republic's Golden Years"
  ncr_early.2.d:0 "Over the 52 years President Tandi led the Republic, the union of five states went from strength to strength. By focusing the Republic's economy and workforce on infrastructure and agriculture, California enjoyed a thriving network of trade routes and Brahmin farms. The clearing of roads, rivers and railways paved the way for the rapid redeployment of the NCR's growing military, allowing the prompt response to threats across southern California and reaching north towards Redding. Backed by an abundance of renewable food thanks to GECK-created farmland and Brahmin herds, the population of settlements major and minor alike exploded, further ballooned by an influx of new settlers from across Northern California and beyond. Never afraid of using underhand tactics to achieve her goals, she bullied New Reno and Vault City into joining the Republic as autonomous territories, and ordered the assault on Navarro that would shatter the Enclave on the West Coast. \n\nIn premiership so abundant with successes and victories, Tandi's legacy has shaped every aspect of the NCR and the wider wasteland. One set of her policies saw success beyond comparison, and helped the founding Shady Sands State grow beyond comparison."

  ncr_early.3.t:0 "Stagnation at the Zenith"
  ncr_early.3.d:0 "Soon after President Tandi's passing in 2248, the New California Republic reached its zenith. Under Tandi, Shady Sands spread from the Pacific to Redding, from the Boneyard to the gates of the Mojave. Even the Golden Circle's towns fell beneath the Bear, as Vault City 'welcomed' a NCR Garrison and Reno became an 'associated state'. At home, Tandi's fierce regulation against wealthy ranchers, the so-called Brahmin Barons, and rich trading monopolies ensured prosperity and support for the Republic and revived dreams of a better world. Tandi's successor, Tibbett, continued the good times, and all thought the Republic's good times would last forever. \n\nBut the fate of the Republic changed forever in 2253, when a caravan of 38 NCR citizens journeying from Arizona to Baker was attacked by raiders in the Northern Mojave, at the time a desolate no-man's land. President Tibbett, following Tandi's mould of preferring diplomacy to brute force, was slow to react to the crisis. While Tibbett dithered, opportunistic senators smelled blood, most notably Wendell Peterson, who demanded military assistance for the crisis. Peterson enchanted Tibbett with the promise that the bear had claws. Peterson's inauguration showed the limits of the NCR's progress. Peterson allied himself with the Brahmin Barons and relied on increasingly militaristic, expansionist policies to win the support of the population. As the Brahmin Barons rose and the vast expansion of the military continued, the NCR started a haphazard period of stagnation. Fueled by Baron and Caravansary money, the Republic entered a harsh cycle of consumerism and corruption. Sure, the Republic thrived, but it was no longer ordinary people gaining most from the growth. \n\nBy 2275, much of Northern California was run from Redding by the Barons themselves, benefiting from NCR protection while contributing little of their own. The Navarro territories, liberated with Brotherhood assistance, are a seething frontier. And the Mojave, well... as they say, the House always wins."
  ncr_early.3.a:0 "The military complex groaned under Peterson's weight."

  ncr_early_political_power_tt:0 "\nThe §YNCR Economy§! will receive a §R5% penalty to political power gain§!."
  ncr_early.3.b:0 "Militaristic propaganda made the Republic cynical."
  ncr_early.3.c:0 "Big Business brought in money, but hurt our politics."
  ncr_early.4.t:0 "Crises in California"
  ncr_early.4.d:0 "Life in the Wasteland isn't simple: especially not for a democracy as cumbersome and problem-riddled as the NCR. After decades of decadent decline under the premiership of Peterson and Kimball, the Republic is facing a number of crises on many fronts. In the south, Dayglow faces off with raider groups along the Colorado and in Baja who threaten the blooming city's security and prosper.  The Brotherhood lurks in its bunkers, and whether they will be friend or foe is too soon to tell.  San Francisco, nominally a friend of the Republic, pursues its own designs under the Shi. The Barons continue to run roughshod over the people of Northern California.  With the NCR distracted, Vault City and Navarro debate their own course.  \n\nBetween now and the 2278 election, the NCR will face a number of §Rcrises§! that it must react to. When these arise, they will be put to the Senate.  Who prevails will decide the fate of the election of 2278."
  ncr_early.4.a:0 "Democracy must prevail!"
  ncr_early.5.t:0 "The 2278 Senate Election"
  ncr_early.5.d:0 "The NCR may be a bit different from what you're used to. There are no chieftains, town bosses, kings, or dictators here. Our leaders are elected by the people! That's right -- every state has the right to send representatives to the Hall of Congress. These representatives select the President and Vice-President to head the council and it is their advice which guides the President's decisions. The Senate election of 2278 will decide, ultimately, who becomes the next president. President Kimball is likely to remain in office, but he faces opposition at home."
  ncr_early.5.a:0 "My allegiance is to the Republic, to Democracy!"
  ncr_early.6.t:0 "The Nightmare in Navarro"
  ncr_early.6.d:0 "The Frontier has collapsed into recriminations and violence. San Franciscans fire upon Californians; tribals sound the drums of war and take up their old raiding ways. In Shady Shands, NCRR carries the heated arguments in Congress to the entire Wasteland, as Kimball prepares to deploy forces to intervene. But Murphy is a fierce opponent in the 'kitchen sink' debates. "Who will you declare war on?" The tribals, our citizens? The lawful immigrants from San Francisco? The Brotherhood, who you claim stokes the conflict? If you want to invoke war powers, then tell us who, in Dharma's name, we are at war with? How convenient, that every enemy of your untrammeled expansion is in this war. Do you want to go to war with the dishes in my sink next?"
  ncr_early.6.a:0 "The Shi shot first!"
  ncr_early.6.b:0 "Van Graffs shot first!"
  ncr_early.7.t:0 "Allgood's Fury"
  ncr_early.7.d:0 "\"I had no idea that things were so good,\" Murphy cried, in the halls of Congress, \"that we once again face a war. The Van Graffs and barons in Navarro trample the rights of tribals; they extort crops from the settlers from the Shi; and they smuggle guns and drugs to Oregon. Now you ask NCR soldiers to fight and die for them?\" \n\nKimball waited for the cries to die down, and slammed a fist on the podium. \"Spare me your moral condescension, Murphy. As far as I can see, it is only the Republic that takes risk for humanity. It is our rangers that cracked down on cannibalism in Navarro. Our merchants who sold the Shi their farming tools. And our settlers that tamed the mighty forests of the north. Some of the men fight for nothing more than the flag and their own interest. But we stand by the people of Navarro, and the Republic - the one society that goes out armed for right, and for freedom. And we will not surrender our hard won lands so you can feel smug at home.\""
  ncr_early.7.a:0 "To the Republic - the home of freedom."
  ncr_early.7.b:0 "A free people should not take it from others."
  ncr_early.7.a_tt:0 "§gSenator Allgood Murphy of the Boneyard has called for a Vote of No Confidence in President Kimball, raising the possibility of Kimball's removal from office before the end of his term. To survive the vote, President Kimball will need to secure the support of a majority of Senators, and vice versa. Once we've chosen a side through our National Focuses, the other side will also begin to take measures against us: we should stay on our toes!§!\n\n"
  ncr_early.8.t:0 "This Congress Has No Confidence in President Kimball"
  ncr_early.8.d:0 "Governor Murphy's exhaustive reports persuade Congress of the clear and present danger of untrammeled expansion. The boys and girls of California will not die in pursuit of Kimball's Old World Dreams, and they will not spend their days patrolling the Mojave, wishing for a nuclear winter."
  ncr_early.8.a:0 "Welcome, President Murphy!"
  ncr_early.8.a_tt:0 "§OAaron Kimball§! will be forced from office by the Senate, and replaced with §OAllgood Murphy§!. §OKimball§! will probably retire to a conformable house in upper Shady Sands.\n"
  ncr_early.9.t:0 "This Congress Retains Confidence in President Kimball"
  ncr_early.9.d:0 "President Kimball's forceful defense of the Republic carried the day. Given the threats arrayed against California, only a firm hand can guide the Republic. And Kimball's victory will remind all not to tread on the Bear."
  ncr_early.9.a:0 "President Kimball's agenda is vindicated!"
  ncr_early.9.a_tt:0 "§OAllgood Murphy§! will resign from the Senate in protest of its decision, retiring to a private life in a small farmstead outside the Boneyard.\n"
  ncr_early.10.t:0 "The Senate Establishes the Navarro Probe"
  ncr_early.10.d:0 "Spurred to action by a swell of public outrage following the Navarro War, a bipartisan group of Senators have demanded the opening of a Senate enquiry into the events that unfolded. The Senate has, of course, complied with their demand, and now a probe dominated by Allgood supporters has begun digging for evidence the attack was spurred by lax Republic expansionism. We must shut down this slander and remind the people that the Shi and Brotherhood started this."
  ncr_early.10.a:0 "Let's find a way to shut it down!"
  ncr_early.11.t:0 "Kimball Moves to Shut Down the Navarro Probe"
  ncr_early.11.d:0 "Spurred to action by a swell of public outrage in Maxson following the end of the Allgood Truce, a bipartisan group of Maxson's Senators have demanded the opening of a Senate enquiry into the events that unfolded. The Senate has, of course, complied with their demand, and now a probe dominated by our supporters has begun digging for evidence the attack was started on Kimball's orders. Such a finding would surely sink his campaign, but we must act fast to find such evidence before he succeeds in shutting us down!"
  ncr_early.11.a:0 "We must move fast!"
  ncr_early.12.t:0 "Gang Violence Blooms in the Hub"
  ncr_early.12.d:0 "The Hub is in some ways the epitome of the NCR's contrast. Home to the Thieves Guild and Underground, it's home to some of the richest merchants in the West. Recent economic development has attracted thousands of citizens to this city, lured to the promise of a bright tomorrow.\n\nBut not everyone can succeed, unfortunately. The numerous gangs present in the city have taken advantage of those who fall through the cracks and have continued to grow in power, resulting in steadily increased violence. With our economic capital embroiled in petty crime, trade income has fallen drastically.\n\nWe could wait for the Hub's municipal forces to resolve the violence themselves, or undertake a federal military and fiscal intervention — after all, investing in the Hub could be a long term benefit to the Republic."
  ncr_early.12.a:0 "Government intervention will help!"
  ncr_early.12.a_tt:0 "A new branch of our focus tree, beginning with the focus entitled §OSend Troopers into the Hub§!, will become available for us to pursue. But the §YNCR Economy§! will require §R5% more consumer goods§!."
  ncr_early.12.b:0 "Such is the price of progress!"
  ncr_early.13.t:0 "The Forgotten Man"
  ncr_early.13.d:0 "The NCR's prosperity has not reached all of its citizens. While life has never been better for thousands of people, there are those who have been left behind in the development of a new, capitalist economy.\n\nWe must do more to help the people of the Republic if we wish to build a nation to stand the test of time — even the barons can see the benefit from a new national railroad system, bringing their stock to Southern California."
  ncr_early.13.a:0 "It's our duty to help."
  ncr_early.13.a_tt:0 "A new branch of our focus tree, beginning with the focus entitled §OPropose the Rural Revitalisation Act§!, will become available for us to pursue.\n"
  ncr_early.14.t:0 "Reinforcements from Shady Sands"
  ncr_early.14.d:0 "Seemingly as an act of unilateral goodwill, the government in Shady Sands has allocated a small portion of their untrained reserves to us. While they won't come equipped or battle-ready, the NCR has also been kind enough to send us enough money to train them up to fighting form. It's not perfect, but it's certainly better than nothing."
  ncr_early.14.a:0 "Thank you, [NCR.GetLeader]"
  ncr_early.15.t:0 "Wendell Peterson's War"
  ncr_early.15.d:0 "In May 2253, a gang of raiders attacked a large trade convoy outside Nipton. Despite a heroic defence by the caravan's guards, all 38 members of the convoy were massacred, and their extensive supplies of food, water and weapons looted. Joanna Tibbet, Tandi's successor to the Presidency, was subsequently removed from power by the Senate over her refusal to commit troops to secure the Mojave. Her replacement, Wendell Peterson, proved more plyable to the Senate's bullish rhetoric, ordering three battalions of Troopers into the Mojave under the command of then-General Aaron Kimball in October. For the following decade Kimball made a name for himself as the principle architect of the \"Pacification of the Mojave\", and under his leadership the NCR captured much of its current holdings. \n\nShortly after Kimball's depature from the Mojave in 2273, Ranger scouts made two shocking discoveries: the intact Hoover Dam, and a mostly undamaged Las Vegas. Now-President Kimball ordered the Dam conquered as his first act of office in 2274, and the subsequent Treaty of New Vegas ensured peace with Mr House. However, these successes quickly evaporated as supply and logistic issues plagued the region, and casualties ever-increased in what was initially pledged as a quick and easy campaign.\n\nNow we stand at an impasse: without help, the Expedition is sure to collapse from exhaustion, but we can only spare so much."
  ncr_early.15.a:0 "A conundrum..."
  ## ncr_early.16 - empty
  ncr_early.17.t:0 "By the People, For the People, Of the People"
  ncr_early.17.d:0 "The Followers are fierce opponents of Kimball, and are backed by Governor Allgood Murphy. As he once put it in the speech earning his name, "We must be thankful, that we have no ills at home, and can afford another war. There is no crime in the Republic. There is no want in the Republic. There are no children in need of schools; no sick in need of care. There are no farmers who need assistance, no neighbors who need a hand. To spend as much blood and treasure as we have, all must be good." \n\nOne of Kimball's other critics is Mayor Hayes of Dayglow. Mocked for his Old World Blues, Hayes studied America's past, the days when a nation stretched from sea to shining sea, with influence extending from pole to frozen pole. Hayes opposes the war in the Mojave because the resources spent there should be spent to uplift the Republic. Indeed, Hayes is perhaps the only NCR politician who does not just respect House, but admires him."
  ncr_early.17.a:0 "Still better than worshipping the Maxson Dynasty."

  ncr_early.18.t:0 "The Way That We Walk"
  ncr_early.18.d:0 "Aradesh was not just the first president of the Republic; he was also a strong believer in the teachings of Dharma. Dharma was one of the great teachers before the War, who prophesied that mankind's greed and folly would lead to death and destruction. Only by following the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path could mankind avoid the endless horror of unchanging war. Understandably, the faith, mocked as a Californian cult before the war, flourished in its aftermath. Dharma's presence isn't as flashy as a Ranger outpost or a Crimson Caravan station; but the faith makes its presence known through soup kitchens, hospitals, and its ties to the Followers. For a single candle can light thousands; and the light is not decreased by being shared."
  ncr_early.18.a:0 "Conquer anger with love, and lies with truth."


  ncr_early.19.t:0 "Our Friends to the South"
  ncr_early.19.d:0 "[NCR.GetLeader] visited Vault City earlier today, and threw his support behind First Citizen Lynette's re-election campaign in the upcoming Vault City Selection, the first-ever public election for the office of the First Citizen. [NCR.GetLeader]'s was noted as giving a stirring speech before a council banquet over a glass of synthehol on the importance of the NCR's and Vault City's economic ties.\n\nKimball was quoted as saying, "Whatever our differences, our support for the rule of law and order brings us together. A far better fate than one that blows us apart.""
  ncr_early.19.a:0 "Different views towards the same end."

  ncr_early.20.t:0 "Putting Knowledge to Work"
  ncr_early.20.da:0 "The Followers have long been the forefront of the NCR's education system, but it is time for a change. The Republic needs to put its knowledge to work to make the world a better place. No longer will progress depend on handouts or charity. No longer shall a 'society of equals' hew to a thousand different goals.\n\nAt Hayes's urging, Kimball and Congress have passed the Californian Restoration Act to form the Office of Science and Industry, an agency dedicated towards scientific advancement. With proper funding, the Republic will continue to walk forward into a better tomorrow."
  ncr_early.20.db:0 "The Followers have long been the mainstay of the NCR's education system, but it is time for a change. The Republic needs to put its knowledge to work to make the world a better place. No longer will progress depend on handouts or charity.

With proper funding, the Republic will continue to walk forward into a better tomorrow."
  ncr_early.20.a:0 "To practive thought!"

  ncr_early.21.t:0 "Senator Murphy Criticizes the Mojave Expedition!"
  ncr_early.21.d:0 "To hear Murphy tell it, our boys at the front are shooting refugees who drink from Camp Meade, torture prisoners for information, and are addicted to an endless supply of jet, gambling, and pornography. That bleeding heart liberal's words are demoralizing our army!"
  ncr_early.21.a:0 "This is why I hate the Followers."

  ncr_kimball.1.t:0 "Strength in the Face of Adversity"
  ncr_kimball.1.d:0 "Congress grew hushed in silence as President Kimball neared the podium. After the election of a new slate of Senators to the NCR Congress, it had become clear President Kimball had retained the support of the majority of the Senate. The Republic remained on a steady course, and all knew it. \n\n\"Senators, I truly am privileged that you have chosen me to continue representing the interests of the Republic for four more years. I vow to continue the work I started when I became the President of this fair Republic, and continue to fiercely defend her borders on all fronts. Over the past five years our Troopers have brought victory after victory across the Wasteland: from driving back the Brotherhood on the coat to pacifying the Mojave, and from ridding Baja of our enemies to securing our northern borders, the NCR's military continues to be the pride of the world.\" \n\nSenators across the room murmured in support. Kimball's bullish, hardline military stances had indeed brought some security to a Republic long plagued by raiders and monsters. \n\n\"I sincerely promise, so long as I continue to command the support of this Senate and the people, to never yield in the face of an enemy to the Republic, within or without. Never again will we back down from defending our people, and never again shall we cut unjust deals. Under my next four years, I will expand our armed forces, centralise our bureaucracy, and expand our Republic to protect all!\" \n\nCheers erupted across the hall, as Senators, guards and members of the public alike broke out in fierce applause. Clearly the President's continued hardline policies remain popular, but if the bodies continue to rack up, will they remain that way?"

If we formally join the Republic, we will become the State of Reno. In return for these concessions, the Republic will amend the constitution to legalize prostitution and gambling, ensuring our security for decades to come. \n\nRuling Reno's great and all, but isn't it better to serve in Shady Sands than to rule in Reno?"
  ncr_kimball.3.a:0 "I can't wait to tax House."

  ncr_kimball.4.d:0 "After decades of will they - won't they, today [NCR.GetLeader] signed a treaty formally annexing New Reno into the Republic, placing one of the West's largest independent cities under the control of the Bear. At long last, New Reno joined the NCR as its latest state, a sign of the Republic's growing influence in Nevada.\n\nIn return, the NCR's states have amended the constitution to legalize gambling and prostitution, a sticking point which had presented an obstacle to prior attempts at integration. Perhaps House will have to find another source of tourists, after all."

  ncr_kimball.12.d:0 "The people of the New California Republic lived rather simple lives. They woke up, they went to work, they went home, they slept. Repeating this cycle for as long as they could remember, from the President of the NCR themselves, to the richest Brahmin Baron, to the lowliest farmer or caravan guard. Which was why, upon announcement of President Kimball opening the NCR's first 24/7 full-time car dealership and garage just outside of Shady Sands, the people of the NCR found themselves in a massive scurry to prepare for the grand opening. Tents were pitched, truckers parked in a circle outside the entrance, even some Brotherhood members were rumored to want to take a gander at what was to be a momentous occasion.\n\n...Which explained why, upon opening day, a massive traffic jam, unlike any seen before, was seen as Kimball awoke from the highest room of the Shady Sands penthouse hotel he was staying at. Although he had recalled seeing images of the massive waves upon waves of cars in the Pre-War era, with many remnants of those jams being seen in the Post-War world, he never expected that something as simple as the opening of a dealership would result in this cavalcade of errors.\n\nAs the people eagerly, if angrily and anxiously, awaited for Kimball's arrival, their eagerness quickly turned to anger as a broadcast emitted from every television, radio, and other communication device within 5 miles of Shady Sands."

Taking a sip, he admired the taste, eyes quickly glancing to the Wright Family crest on the bottle. He then placed the glass down and opened the report laid before him. Going over the details for what seemed like the fourth time today, his eyes fell on the 80s crest in an attached photograph. His mind began to drift to his youth, sitting at his fathers feet, looking at this very crest all those years ago.\n\nHis Father was a soldier, returned from his service in the NCR army, having returned from the First Nevada Road War with some souvenirs, a bullet in his arm, and stories for his son. He talked about the war and about the tribal savages who roamed the roads around Sac-City. He had taken this crest off an 80s vehicle, having personally shot the driver and bringing the vehicle to a flaming stop. He looked down at his son, and what he said to him would stay with Aaron all the way up to his presidency.\n\n“These bastards needed to be stopped, and although I drove them out of their hole, it will be you, Aaron, who will put them down”\n\nComing back to reality, President Kimball drew his pen, and signed the order for the invasion of the 80s.

  ncr_murphy.1.d:0 "Caesar isn't the only leader to be raised by the Followers of the Apocalypse. Murphy was orphaned by one of the ceaseless wars with the Brotherhood, but the 'anarchists' of the Boneyard raised him to forgive those who trespassed against him. To Murphy, Civilization is not a plasma rifle or a cult of authority. It's not a robot emperor or a holographic woman. It's a land that knows freedom from want, and freedom from fear. \n\nAs Murphy said in his inauguration speech, 'We know the world tends towards destruction. But let us try to make a difference.'  Caesar would call Murphy a fool; but perhaps Bull will find out that compassion is stronger than he thinks."
  ncr_murphy.1.a:0 "Let's find new ways for an old world."

  ncr_murphy.2.t:0 "The Blades"
  ncr_murphy.2.d:0 "While much of the NCR struggles with crime, the Boneyard is one of the safer regions due to protection from the Blades. Founded after the Great War by a woman named Razor in a pre-war nightclub, the Blades protect the Boneyard and Hub as a mix of a people's militia and vigilante justice. Although some criticize their rough Wasteland notion of justice, none can deny they protect their homes. \n\nMurphy proposes to take this model nationwide, promoting a people's militia. The name?  The Bear Claws."

  ncr_murphy.3.t:0 "Support from Shady Sands"
  ncr_murphy.3.d:0 "Since our founding we've stood as the northern wall of California, the gateway against the cannibals of the north. Now Murphy wishes to recognize and support our role, expanding trading ties between our two nations. This will lead to more profit for both of us, and confirms that the Republic is the West's last, best hope. Perhaps, in time, this will lead to closer relations between our peoples."
  ncr_murphy.3.a:0 "Do they still have that statue?"

  ncr_murphy.4.d:0 "For reasons that remain unclear, [ARR.GetLeader] rejected our proposal. Perhaps the rumours that the Chosen One engaged in pornography in his breaks between slave raids were true? Regardless, this will only embolden the hawks in the Republic."

  ncr_murphy.5.t:0 "Corruption Crackdown!"
  ncr_murphy.5.d:0 "Although the Van Graffs hail from Redding, they've long been opponents of Shady Sands. Under Kimball, he overlooked their past misconduct. But delays continued; cost overruns increased. Now rumours swirl that the Van Graffs will sell energy weapons to the Legion! These false slanders encouraged [NCR.GetLeader] to bring charges against the Van Graffs! NCR Rangers have seized many of the Van Graffs' assets, and relations between the family and the Republic will only worsen. Perhaps the family's criticisms of the Republic were justified after all?"

  ncr_murphy.6.t:0 "Better Living Aboveground"
  ncr_murphy.6.d:0 "Although [NCR.GetLeader] is a bit too... idealistic for our tastes, with his love of the lesser sort, none can deny that we have more in common with the NCR than literally any other city or people. To that end, Murphy has offered a detachment of 'volunteers' to augment our military, in return for industrial aid. How shall we respond?"

  ncr_murphy.9.d:0 "For too long, the NCR has risked walking down the road Americans walked. We cut down the mighty redwoods. We exhaust soil and drain lakes for our crops. We pollute and pour waste into the ocean. But this must stop. \n\nThe Followers seek to turn the old facility into a research base, devoted to restoring the Wastes. This is the work of generations. Not even a G.E.C.K. factory could undo all the harm. But though the world tends towards destruction, we must try to make a difference.  And that difference starts now."
  ncr_murphy.9.a:0 "A G.E.C.K. factory would help, though."

  ncr_murphy.10.t:0 "The North Moss"
  ncr_murphy.10.d:0 "Mossman stood at the north side of the wrestling ring within Red Sun Stadium. Although the NCR had won against the Legion, partnering with the Free Fighters, there was a certain matter that had remained unaddressed. In the fool mind of Big Al, the proprietor of a roach grill, who had spent a considerable amount of garnered wasteland funds hoping to fund the fight, he had wanted Lanius to face off against one of the Free Fighters. Particularly Mil Mascaras. But with the fall of the Legion, and Lanius as a result, the match was postponed, leaving the roach grill owner with over a million caps spent building a stadium and promoting a match that would not take place.\n\nWanting to avoid any kind of economic trouble, Allgood personally met with Big Al. Mossman happened to enter the room when Big Al started getting heated. But on taking one look at him, Al lost all anger, and immediately demanded that Mossman take Lanius' place. Though neither Allgood or Mossman could understand the man's logic, they accepted, the latter much more reluctantly. To make it more fair, Allgood requested that, in exchange for Mossman fighting, that El Santo take the place of Mil Mascaras. Though Al had some of his anger return, Allgood's quick thinking allowed him to spin the change as a net positive to both the NCR, the Free Fighters, and most importantly, the economic states of both. To this, Al agreed."

After some slight delays, live from Red Sun Stadium, I'm Rocky Rich Rodney, or Triple-R, bringing you a monumental fight indeed! In the north corner, weighing 175 pounds, introducing the challenger, The North Moss! He's lean, he's green (to fighting, that is), and you bet your boots he's mean!" The crowd gave murmurs and slight boos. "And in the south corner, one of the three reigning champions of the Free Fighters, weighing in at 210 pounds, El Santo!" The crowd erupted into cheers and praise.\n\n"Place your bets, folks, because this is a night you won't forget anytime soon!""

  ncr_murphy.11.t:0 "Mojave Mistakes"
  ncr_murphy.11.d:0 "President Allgood Murphy ascended the steps to the landing pad, the vertibird ready to take off and deliver the President to Hoover Dam for his speech. General Mossman walked behind him, talking frantically.\n\n“Sir, with all due respect, it's far too dangerous for you to go to the Mojave. I've said this for days now, the security risk posed by Legion operatives is much too high for my liking. Please reconsider Sir.”\n\nClimbing onto the transport, Allgood turns and smiles at Mossman, the blades of the vertibird beginning to whirl.\n\n“It is important that the troops see that their President is willing to share the same risks as them, Mossman. Besides, your Rangers will protect me, as they do here. See you soon, General.”\n\nWith that, the door closes and the vertibird rises into the sky, heading towards the rising sun."

Present at the speech was many of the leaders of the Mojave Territories administration, including General Oliver. After a small moment of appreciation and minutes silence for all the lives unfortunately lost in the campaign, President Murphy began to lambast the administration of the territories, calling into question its treatment of the locals, most notably in Freeside, and the disproportionate amount of aid given to NCR citizens over the local populace. After specifically placing the blame on General Oliver, President Murphy then announced that from this day forth, all civilians of the Mojave would receive equal treatment to that of NCR citizens.\n\nEnding his speech, a commotion occurred when a man identified as a Legion assassin attempted to rush the President with a knife. He was quickly subdued by the President's Ranger guards, who rushed the President to his transport. Another man, assumed to be the assassin's accomplice, was later apprehended fleeing the Dam. The President is alive and well back in Shady Sands."

  ncr_murphy.12.d:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] was met with a rather interesting proposition... demand, really, when it was announced that NCR Ranger Mossman had gone through a change of heart through Allgood. Many had speculated that the Bear would become a kinder beast, but the NCR's immediate neighbors, much less [ROOT.GetName], didn't expect the full extent of it. Not only did Mossman and Allgood write individualized personal letters to all NCR neighbors, they considered their distinct culture, relationship with the NCR, and even what the states of their militaries, economies, and politics were. Although most of the Mossman legal jargon and heartfelt Allgood sentiment boiled down to 'we are guaranteeing your independence from all foreign entities', the promise of NCR Ranger divisions, trained under the new Good-man Doctrine (Allgood's self-given name to the Mossman Doctrine), was certainly a nice bonus to have."

While there has been much blood on both sides, AllGood Murphy requests that we begin efforts to slowly rekindle a road towards a formal peace treaty. In exchange, he has offered to open the Brotherhood's old outpost in Shady Sands as an embassy, a place for us to discuss our grievances and disagreements freely. \n\nPeace, after so long, may not be easy.

'Father Elijah', formally swear to establish peaceful relations, as well as an informal embassy, between the New California Republic?"\nMcNamara nodded.

"I suppose we should be grateful that this could be solved amicably then."\nAs Crocker left, Veronica looked towards McNamara.

And while I wish that you could stay with us in our newfound peace and hopeful prosperity with the New California Republic, I understand your wishes to find respite elsewhere. I have undertaken all necessary measures to ensure that, wherever you go, you are always welcome with the Brotherhood.

Veronica had to duck when Elijah's latest failure came soaring past her, breaking into pieces on the metal doorframe.\n\n"My apologies for intruding, Father Elijah, but I have news from my latest scouting report."\nElijah grunted in acknowledgement, still facing the worktable.\n"...The New California Republic has recently elected a new President. One who has made peace with the Council and High Elders of Lost Hills. He is willing to help us with dealing with the Legion."\n\nThe fist of the aged Elder slammed the table, sending a loud clang through the room.\n"The NCR are a bunch of uneducated toy soldiers playing pretend. The only reason that they made anything of themselves at all is because the world decided it needed another America to repeat its mistakes!"\nVeronica lowered her head. She had anticipated this sort of response from Elijah. However, Elijah sighed, and began mulling about the room. This, she had not expected.\n"Feh, if the NCR are truly willing to help, and they've fooled the foolish fools at Lost Hills... we do need supplies, manpower. Perhaps they could even give us back some of our armor and weapons..."\n\nElijah's pacing came to a sudden stop, turning to Veronica. "Look up, child, we'll never get anywhere fighting the Legion if we stare no higher than our feet."\nPicking out a holodisk from a nearby file cabinet, Elijah began typing out a series of keystrokes on his Pip-Boy. After what felt like seconds, he handed it to Veronica.\n"Take this holodisk to the highest NCR official you come across. I don't care if they're a 5 star general or the President himself.

He sighed. "If you've been standing there this whole time, you'd know our situation is desparate. That's why I'm making a very harsh, but necessary, decision."\nMurmurs began to erupt in the crowd. Elijah raised his hand to quiet them. "There is a small path from Hidden Valley that leads to one of our safehouses. I've staffed it with robot security to ensure the Legion haven't taken it. You will all go there. I will arrange a call with the NCR President, or whomever in his military equals him, and have all of you rescued and recovered for transport to NCR territory. You will all be safe there."\n\nVeronica was the first to ask the obvious question. "And what will happen to you, Father?"\nElijah paused. "In the Pre-War days, whenever a captain of a large vessel, an airplane, a boat, a spacecraft, was faced with a perilous situation, they would always have everyone else get out first, and then go down with the ship. In some situations, the captain would get out with the rest, but I do not know if I have that luxury."\nVeronica opened her mouth to argue, but was silenced by Elijah's cold gaze.

Having salvaged various fusion cores from nearby cars, ejecting all remaining microfusion cells from his weapons, and even taking apart his single remaining Power Armor set for the TX-2800 microfusion reactor, Elijah had set up a venerable Mother Of All Nukes within the Hidden Valley Bunker.With what little time he could spare, he slammed the button on the emergency override to open the bunker doors. The monitors flashed and flickered, as each and every Legion soldier was gunned down in a flurry of gunfire. But it wasn't enough. Elijah could only salvage so many bullets, so after minutes of countless death, Caesar's wall of flesh proceeded on into the bunker. It was with that, that Elijah began the 1 minute countdown to the bunker's self-destruction.\nHe had rewired the bunker's emergency alarm system to the loudspeakers, allowing him to speak his mind one last time, before he, and hopefully a large chunk of Caesar's war slaves, were taken out with him.\n\n"This thing on? This is Father Elijah speaking, for anyone here who knows proper English instead of your butchered Latin that Caesar insists you speak in. I may be a foolish old man, but the only real fool choice I made was staying here. But in my years of service with the Brotherhood, I believe I'm truly doing the world a favor by ridding it of the likes of you. Somewhere, in another life, I'd probably be on some quest to the Big Empty, the Sierra Madre, maybe even visit the Divide. But I'm here now. Veronica and her girl are safe back in California, as are the rest of the Mojave Brotherhood."\n\nElijah looked over at the countdown timer. 30 seconds.\n\n"I know I haven't been the best father to her. To anyone. But I always did my best. But to make an analogy you Roman wannabes will understand, I'm Sisyphus, constantly pushing the rock up the mountain, never able to get it to the top. But no more."\n\n10 seconds.\n\nElijah summoned a voice that even he never knew he was capable of, in order to give a final send-off to the Legion: "I DEFY YOU, CAESAR! YOU HEAR ME, YOU SKIRT WEARING HISTORY REJECTS? THIS OUGHT TO SHOW YOU WHERE YOU REALLY BELONG IN THE HISTORY BOOKS, AS NOTHING MORE THAN A GOD-DAMNED STAIN!"\n\n0 seconds."

  ncr_allgood.20.d:0 "We've recently received supplies from the New California Republic. It seems that their new President, Allgood, is on a mission to exterminate injustice and tyranny all across the wasteland. We don't know how well he'll succeed in that, the wasteland is a big place, after all. But we'll gladly take free equipment and some highly experienced rangers!"

  ncr_allgood.21.t:0 "Look At This Codac"
  ncr_allgood.21.d:0 "President Allgood Murphy stood upon the dusty asphalt of what had once been the site of the NCR's biggest battle to date. The remnants of the Battle of Navarro had long since been cleared away by Kimball's administration, though Allgood had put a pause on what he considered to be the biggest examples of the prior administration's corruption. In his longcoat, he carried a special memento that would either make or break his intended visitor's resolve in the drastic suggestion he intended to propose to him. Before he could think any further, an NCR deuce coupe pulled up, styled in NCR military livery. Although the car was an open-top, Murphy needed to look no further than the paint to know who this car belonged to.\n\nGeneral Alexander Drummond stepped out of the coupe, taking care to avoid a direct gaze with the President. Looking out at the barren field, Drummond asked simply: "What had you bring me back here, Murphy?"\nMurphy reached into his coat, pulling out a single thin parcel. "Open it." Drummond did so. Once open, the parcel revealed a small, carefully preserved, Codac R9000 photograph. The photograph itself was almost artesian in its quality, capturing a now-redacted date in the NCR's history, shortly before the historic Battle of Navarro itself. Drummond's impression of the photograph, though Murphy anticipated it to be unremarkable, was curious to him. "They never did manage to get my face pictured right.""
  ncr_allgood.21.a:0 "...."
  ncr_allgood.22.t:0 "Look At This Codac Pt2"
  ncr_allgood.22.d:0 "The Codac depicted Drummond and a Brotherhood Knight, armored in T-51, standing in front of the then-new NCR flag, looking over a battalion of training Knights and Paladins, also armored in T-51 Power Armor. In the background, dozens of NCR troopers scattered about to and fro, preparing for the largest battle of the nation, and their own lives, at the time. Although the NCR's motorized capacity was low at the time, the NCR truck and planes flying over the field gave a significant impression of the coming battle.\n\nDrummond gripped the edges of the photo. "Why are you showing me this? I thought I had the only copy, thanks to that damned photographer getting themselves killed trying to get their 'perfect shot'."\n\nMurphy took a slight sigh. "Drummond, you've worked with the Brotherhood once before. This battle, your reputation, everything having to do with Navarro, would have never happened the way it did without your ability to work with them. Now, I'm not a religious man, but I am a very righteous man. And in my years of practice, I've come to learn the value of forgiveness. I don't know if your own positions on the Brotherhood are the same as they were 30 years ago, but we have the greatest Republic in the world, and I want to keep it great. But we also need to recognize that we've made mistakes. The war with the Brotherhood being one of our greatest mistakes. Now, if you don't agree with me, feel free to tear up that photo. But if you want to head or lead negotiations, work with them, help me to understand them, then please keep that photo intact. I won't force you to pick one or the other.""
  ncr_allgood.22.a:0 "Drummond ripped the photo in half, and then again until it was nothing more than colored confetti."
  ncr_allgood.22.b:0 "Drummond carefully slipped the photo back into its package."

  ncr_hayes_expansion.2.t:0 "Steel Lady of California"
  ncr_hayes_expansion.2.d:0 "Hayes paced in his President-Elect office chambers. He had called for Moore to meet with him, taking note of her endeavors during the ongoing Mojave Campaign. "As you may have come to know, despite your time out of the country, I’m a man of the 2070s, yet I reach for the future, to bring us back to that era."\nMoore glared, taking an immense interest in the floor than continuing to look towards the bespectacled candidate. "An interesting proposition, if it weren't coming from a man who has more in common with a certain group of bug-eyed freaks with buggier choppers."\nA pause impregnated itself in the room, only being broken by the lamentation of the future President of the NCR. "I believe in the old ways. I believe in the values and traditions that have been passed down through generations of American history. But I also believe in the future. Our future. I believe in the potential of the NCR and the world we can make beyond New California. I believe that we can create something better than what we have now. That’s why I wanted to become President. And now I have."\n\n"You’re another idealist then." Moore shook her head, unable to believe she had come to meet with the President, only to find he was as foolish as the past administrations she had served under.\n\nHayes stood tall, the light of the room reflecting his spectacles into brilliant discs. "I am. I believe in the glory of the old United States. I believe in the power of democracy. I believe that if we work together, we can make a difference. We can create a brighter future."\n\n“And what will you do if you can't do that?"\n\nA glaze formed over the eyes behind the discs, quickly taken away by a flutter of blinks and renewed vigor. "You know what they said in the Old World. Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars."\nMoore cautiously gazed at the albino soon-to-be president. She still saw yet another useless man who would likely go on to grind up thousands of men in some pointless faraway war, but she couldn't help but have some confidence in the man's bravado and self-assurance. She outstretched her gloved hand.\n\n"Mr. President..."

And she believed Hayes was the right man for it.\n\nBut one thing Hayes told her kept Rosado on her toes.\n\nBrotherhood of Steel.\n\nHayes was a vivid hater of them, and knowing this, Rosado was surprised that he had agreed to work with her, but a recent meeting showed why.\n\nHayes said that he was willing to give more privileges to Rosado, and even to give funds for her scientific research, for as it turns out the president is an extremely intelligent man himself, but the condition was that Rosado's connection to the Alamo be publicly severed. And that thought kept Rosado on his toes. "Am I willing to betray my friend for the sake of progress?""

  ncr_hayes_expansion.4.t:0 "Shutting The Front Door"
  ncr_hayes_expansion.4.d:0 "For Dornan, meeting the President was supposed to be a great honor, a lifetime goal or achievement, a symbol that he had made his mark on the world. And yet, in spite of all he hoped, he found himself meeting a President, just not the right one. He had once had dreams of serving alongside the great Frank Horrigan, serving on the Richardson Presidency's Secret Service. That all went up in a nuclear fireball in the fall of 2242, when the Oil Rig exploded. He had done his best to keep his men calm and his plasma rifle charged. After 4 years of holding the NCR off, however, he found himself with more empty suits of Mark II Powered Combat Armor, and his plasma rifle had run out of charges long before that.\n\nDornan's men never had any qualms with his leadership, despite how many of his men snidely referred to him as their "mean old" sergeant, but Dornan knew that, if he wished to make a new living for himself in this Enclave-free world, he would need a new identity. And so, Chad Rannor was born. A short buzzcut, a pair of tinted glasses, and a salvaged set of leather armor completed the illusion. But Dornan never forgot where he came from. It was one of the reasons that he almost immediately ended up outing himself in Vault City. Upon taking the citizenship test, he immediately nearly wrung Proconsul Gregory's neck, screaming at him about how he lived in the most glorious bastion of America in the wasteland, yet was squandering it by making his men go through, as Rannor put it, "a lily-livered pencilneck wet dream to make sissies out of the real men".\n\nGregory's neck was spared from permanent injury, thankfully, due to the interference of Citizen Sergeant Stark. The two men shouted until their faces just about turned blue. Finally, after nearly an hour of "civil conversation", or a shouting match as Gregory called it, the two men agreed to a compromise. Due to Rannor's previous experience in a "highly classified Pre-War military operations group" (one that was responsible for Vault City to begin with, as Rannor was so kind as to explain to Stark), he would not only be made a citizen, but would also become a sergeant within the Vault City Guard, no questions asked, with full confidence that the NCR would never learn of his true heritage.\n\nRannor's thoughts were interrupted by the squawk of the intercom, signaling that President Hayes was ready to see him. Preparing to step through the door, Arch Dornan prepared to adopt his Chad Rannor identity once more, not knowing what to expect from the man behind the door."

  ncr_hayes_expansion.5.t:0 "One Small Step For Hayes..."
  ncr_hayes_expansion.5.d:0 "The conditions of the recently-refurbished Manned Spacecraft Center, or, as Hayes preferred to refer to it by its old nickname, "Space City", were almost entirely perfect for the historic achievement Grant C. Hayes wished to be present to see. After delegations with the previous owners, the "Houston Rockets", the New American Republic now had full control over the operations and facilities within the Space Center.\nAlthough some criticisms were given to the Hayes Administration for automatically wishing to launch a crewed mission to space, rather than dealing with some of the more fundamental internal and external issues of the NAR, Hayes brushed them off as being short-sighted. He himself had changed his typical suit for a pristine white suit, with a small memento pin, shaped as an asymmetrical arrowhead, received fron an old Captain Cosmos promotion he had been fascinated with in his youth.\n\nA technician, dressed in salvaged United States Space Administration gear, approached Hayes. "One minute to launch, Mr. President, would you like to remain here, or retreat to the observation area?" \n\n"I'd prefer to stay here." Hayes replied simply, continuing to stare up at the launch complex and the service structure, housing the shuttle that would hopefully complete his biggest dream of all. \n\nThe shuttle itself was the salvaged combination of the Hermes-XIII and Hermes-XIV shuttles recovered from Bloomfield. Although the XIII had a more unorthodox structure, resembling that of a Pre-War idea of a futuristic bomber than a spacecraft, the XIV was the much more rudimentary, though non-functioning on its own, design. The two had originally been conceived of as Mars missions, but, as Hayes did not want to begin a mission that could last his whole administration quite yet, he settled for a mission that could be completed in considerably less time.\nThe crew themselves were hand-picked by Hayes, representing a new frontier in not only NAR history, but American history. A man, a woman, a robot, and a ghoul. He wanted to include a Super Mutant, so as not to anger his other mutant supporters, but neither the technology nor space allowed for it, plus Dayglow had a bigger ghoul population.\n\nAs the countdown began, Hayes thought of himself beginning to shed a tear at his fantasies being made reality. And as the rocket began to lift off from its structure, the first of many NAR missions, to space, to the final frontier, and possibly beyond, began in the same way all dreams did. Up into the wild blue yonder."

  ncr_hayes_expansion.6.t:0 "The Big Red Button"
  ncr_hayes_expansion.6.d:0 "Hayes had recently returned from a personal venture in overseeing the NAR reconstruction of the Navarro complex, currently planned to be turned into a museum once all items of value were recovered and extracted from it. This venture, however, had Hayes bringing back a small, curious, device. Although the taped-on Enclave marking and heavily faded American flag insignias were familiar, the device itself, a small, rectangular brick with an extending antenna, a touch-interface screen, and, most notably, a large red button at the very center. As the button was unlit, Hayes had little temptation to actually press it, but was still intent on figuring out what it did.\n\nTaking upon the burdensome task of polishing his spectacles, he began on an important journey, one he frequently lampooned his predecessors for: Reading the instructions. Although they were located on the back, the actual label was torn, and largely consisted of technological gibberish and semi-understandable jargon. After several minutes of reading, and hours spent attempting to piece together what few pictures there were, Hayes came to understand that the device was a sort of trigger for an orbital delivery system.\n\nUpon taking off the back cover of the device and replacing the fission battery, he activated the touchscreen, revealing the device had automatically been plugged into aiming at two locations, with a third option being to simply deliver the payload at a random location. The title displayed at the top was "POTENTIAL THREATS". Although Hayes had his personal feelings about the Enclave, any threat to them could easily be a threat to the NAR as well.\n\nThe first option read: 35.6163° N, 119.6943° W.\n\nThe second read: 34.3534° N, 107.5644° W.[ncr_hayes_button]\nThe large red button, now brightly lit, become ever more tempting to him...\n\nHayes pondered over which he would select."

  ncr_hayes_expansion.7.d:0 "Elijah had finally made it. All his preparations, all the mockery he had suffered, all the insolence he had forced to undergo through his leadership of the Mojave Chapter. It had all led up to this. The gates of the Sierra Madre, as pristine as the day they were built, beckoned towards him. He had sent scouts ahead to look over at the site, dreaming of all the secrets it could hold. Big Mountain had been a treasure trove unto itself, but this... this was to be his crowning achievement.\n\nAll of a sudden, Elijah's Pip-Boy began buzzing, as it emitted a voice that he had never heard before, picked up on some ancient broadcast that had seemed to emit from the Sierra Madre itself.\n\n"This is Frederick Sinclair speaking. The godless Chinamen have finally done it. The Gala Event, my friends, is unfortunately delayed for the foreseeable future. I have every bit of confidence that this casino will be able to withstand the brunt of a nuclear blast. However, if you find yourself outside the protection of the many facilities, please note that Rad-X and RadAway are able to be constructed through the vending machines through a holotape recipe, which I will make available at a starting price of 5 million dollars per disk, not counting chip costs. I must now retreat to my personal vault. Please enjoy the complimentary refreshments, and thank you for staying at the Sierra Madre, where everyone has a chance to begin again."\n\nElijah listening to the extent of a dead man's ramblings and needless overcharging for a basic commodity distracted him from the oncoming danger, but by the moment he picked his head up to begin running away or seeking cover, it was too late..."

  ncr_hayes_expansion.8.t:0 "In This Man's Army Now"
  ncr_hayes_expansion.8.d:0 "General Alexander Drummond stood at the sequoia wood door that led to newly inaugurated President Hayes' office. He wasn't sure why he'd been called at so late in the morning, but he'd never been one for being late or too early, he made a point to be on time no matter what.\n"The President will see you now, General." The intercom buzzed into life and died just as it began.\nEntering the room, Drummond was met with a plethora of both Old World history and New World mementos, ordered across the room in a neat and orderly fashion. If he hadn't known this was the same office of Aaron Kimball, Wendell Peterson, Joanna Tibbet, and Tandi herself, he would have thought he'd accidentally stepped into a Followers or even a Brotherhood shrine or museum.\n\nHayes looked up at him from behind the President's desk, holding a paper and simultaneously glancing at a portable terminal he had set up.\n"Ah, General. Good to see you." Before Drummond could even acknowledge being spoken to, Hayes waved his free hand at him, still looking intently at the paper and screen."Before you say anything, I've come to learn quite a bit about you. Would you mind if I shared?"\n\nDrummond gave a brief headshake.\n\n"Splendid. Now, let's see... born in 2199, trained with the Desert Rangers, Arizona Division, educated at the Aradesh School District just outside of the Boneyard, graduated from the Seth Military Academy, with high marks in Pre-War military history and an exquisite knowledge and interest in things related to the Pre-War period known as World War 2, going as far as to... salvage a tank of all things, heh. After graduation, you rose from a Lieutenant to Captain, with Tandi giving you exceptional honors upon your actions as the "Hero of Navarro" between 2242 and 2246. As of 2265, after approximately 4 decades of military service, you retired, only to come back at the request of the previous administration."\nHayes finally looked up, giving the general a bright grin and wide eyes from behind his glasses.\n"I skimmed on a few details, nobody needs to know where exactly you got the equipment you needed to deal with the Enclave back at Navarro with a war on, but you, my friend, are probably one of the few people in this backwater pastiche of America who would probably understand what I am planning, and especially what I am about to say next. You're already a General, and I can make you a Brigadier or even a four or even five star one with a snap, but how do you feel about a little... historical reenactment?"\n\nDrummond finally snapped up the courage to speak. Gruffly, he gave the inquiry. "A reenactment of what exactly, Mr. President?"\nHayes looked once more at the paper. "It says you wrote a military thesis on how you would have more effectively and efficiently conducted several European operations, especially ones like Normandy, the Bulge, and Meuse. How would you like to put your theorem to the test?"\nDrummond finally broke through the stone face he had set himself, giving the President a wide smile."

For thirty days, [NCR.GetLeader] had clung to power. Every Senator knew he was a lame duck, doomed to be replaced. No Senator knew who the replacement would be. \n\n\"Senators, we find ourselves in a crisis never seen before by our fair Republic.  Corruption and a hunger for power have tainted this Congress, and have rendered it unable to elect a new President to lead the Republic forwards. For thirty days, you have deliberated without success. Deals have been struck and abandoned. Dirty money has run amok.\" \n\nThe Senators shuddered. They shuddered not because they minded being called corrupt, or hungry for power: all knew most in Congress were both. Instead they shuddered because they realised as one what his next words would be, and why he had summoned them. They shuddered for they knew with his next words, Kimball was rolling the dice one last time. \n\n\"We must have a President. Without one, unrest grows in our towns and cities, in our states and territories. Our enemies across the Wasteland, and within our borders, have already begun plotting against us in our moment of weakness.

Led by members of the military and civil service, the coup's ringleaders have declared a \"Committee for National Security\", citing the need for political stability in the face of the Republic's many internal and external foes. While initially promising fresh elections, hope for a return to democracy evapourated after they signed into law the "Law to Remedy the Distress of People and California". The Decree effectively abolishes the federal foundations of the NCR, centralizes power in Shady Sand. \n\nThe governments of Boneyard, Dayglow and Redding were quick to denounce the Decree as illegitimate and label the Committee's assention to power as little more than a military coup.

Murphy and the Followers led protests for human rights and reports of Legion spies among the demonstrators only proved the pacifists could not be trusted.

Pushed out of the their garrisons within the Mojave and forced to make a fighting retreat along the Long 15, the Mojave Territories have officially capitulated. A tentative peace deal has ended hostilities in the region for now, and the bulk of the Mojave Expedition's men have been reabsorbed into the Republic's armed forces. \n\nNow, with [252.Owner.GetName] in control of the Hoover Dam and the Republic's influence in the Mojave collapsing, the NCR will surely need a period of soul-searching to work out what went wrong.

  ncr_crisis.6.d:0 "Major Cassandra Moore was in Shady Sands when the fateful day arrived. She had been reassigned to oversee the Shady Sands Garrison just days after the election on the authority of General Jim Marshal, for reasons she didn't at first understand. As such, she'd seen firsthand the Republic's rapid slide into chaos: a Senate in disarray, a President trying to hold back the inevitable, and days of agonising paralysis. To her, the crisis seemed like yet another symptom of the Republic's flawed democracy, one that was becoming increasingly in need of dramatic change to save. The president was still in power, and some legitimacy remained, so she kept order on the streets as best she could. \n\nThere was a knock at the door of her windowless office, interrupting her quiet musings. It was a man she recognised well, Ranger General Mossman, covered in scorch marks and flanked by two Rangers from the 32nd.\n\"Good morning, Major Moore. It appears we have a bit of a situation.\" He spoke quickly, with his characteristic charm all but gone. Moore realised something had gone wrong. It should be General Marshal, not him! \nBefore she could question him, Mossman continued. \"A meeting of the War Cabinet was attacked not but ten minutes ago. A bomb, contained in a briefcase sat under the table, detonated during the meeting. The President, Cabinet, and military High Command are fine paste across the wall, and I was only saved by the hefty table leg that sat between me and it.\" Shit, Moore thought. Shit, shit, shit. Mossman pressed on. \"With the presumed death of General Marshal, you are now the highest ranking officer of the Army, as I am of the Ranger Corps. We need to work out a way forward, and fast.\" \n\nWho planted the bomb that killed the president and his war cabinet? Why was Mossman himself the only one spared a messy death? Why was Moore reassigned by the Marshal to lead the garrison yet not invited to the meeting? Questions abound, and yet few answers present themselves."

Faith in democracy had held strong while there was still a President in power, but in the void that has followed his assassination the Republic's enemies have been swift at seeing opportunity. Without a President, they muse, there will be no person to order the deployment of divisions to counter their raids. Their recent probing attacks have probably proven their theory, and raider violence has blossomed across the Republic. The Senate, meanwhile, has continuted to be paralysed by indecision. In the face of the President's assassination and ever-growing chaos, they've fallen flat. Enough is enough. \n\nAt 09:04am, Ranger and Army units moved in sync to occupy key buildings across Shady Sands. Within minutes, the Senate, Presidential Palace and Radio Transmitters had all been occupied. Ten minutes later an unamed civil servant broadcast a statement over the Wasteland: the Committee for National Security had assumed the powers of the President until the Senate can elect a new leader. \n\nWhile the precise members of the Committee are officially anonymous, most know the Committee to be an alliance between senior military and civilian officials. The sense of unity in the face of adversity seems reassuring to the people of Shady Sands. After all, they're just doing the necessary until the Senate can elect a new President. Right?"

Not a land where every man's a king - but a land where no man was. \n\nNot every ranger, or surviving Congressman, supported Moore and Mossman.

  ncr_order.1.t:0 "The Night of the Service Rifle"
  ncr_order.1.d:0 "It was 01:38am, and all was quiet at the Ranger Headquarters. Nestled amongst the military quarter of Shady Sands, the HQ served as the primary training, housing and administrative hub for the entire corps. At its heart sat Ranger General Mossman, caught in deep thought as he mused over the events of the past few weeks. Alongside Moore, he had done what was necessary to contain the ongoing crisis: that much he knew for certain. She was quick to come up with ideas, and effective at getting the job done. Yet something about her didn't sit quite right with Mossman. She was effective, sure, but she was almost too good. Every decision she made was quick and blunt, as if according not to a decision but instead to a plan. The thought troubled him. Why, was she of all people reassigned to Shady Sands shortly after the election? Why had her face contorted in concern only when he mentioned the grusome end of the military High Command, but not when he had mentioned the President? He paused, unwilling to follow the questions to their conclusion. Had she given the order for the Senate to be abruptly ended, blindsiding the Committee and his Rangers? \n\nSuddenly, successive streaks of bullets rang out through the still night, yanking Mossman out of his thoughts. He ran to the window, which overlooked the courtyard. Nothing? Then, in front of his eyes, a blinding flash at the main gate. The Headquater's piercing alarm switched on as Mossman watched the two great steel gates collapse inwards admidst a cloud of smoke. A second later, figures poured into the floodlit courtyard clad in sand-brown Trooper gear: the armour of the Baja veterans freshly redeployed two days ago at Moore's behest. Mossman turned, grabbing his two 10mm pistols from his desk as all hell broke loose in the courtyard. If he could just reach the barracks, he might yet organise a successful defence before Moore's troopers could capitalise on their surprise. Curse her! Was she behind it all, or merely seizing the oppertunity? He ran out his office and down the stairs. I must rally the troops and bring her to justice, he thought. It was too late. Troopers burst through the stairwell entrance as was half a flight of stairs away from them. All they found when they hit his office was an unidentifiable and scarred corpse decorated with Mossman's armour and dogtags with a gunshot to the temple."

Of course, it didn't last that way for long. Instead, it became an instrument to represent the uneasy alliance between Moore's Army and Mossman's Rangers as they both sought to quell growing unrest. Neither saw eye to eye, but both knew without such an alliance California would fall into true civil war, and as such the Committee became less a debating chamber of equals and more a place for Moore and Mossman to hammer out acceptable compromises.\n\nWith the framing and elimination of Mossman, and Moore enjoying credit from newfound victories on the fronts, the Committee is entirely under Moore's thumb. By proclaiming her President-General, reflecting her unified leadership of the civilian and military aspects of the state, we can mark an end to Mossman's weak morality and the start of a new, strong California. A California dedicated to reclaiming what was lost, through whatever means necessary. A California where none question their leader, and all are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice to defend California's natural land."

However in the recent years of conflict that had finally reached their bloody conclusion California finally came out on top.\nThe Brotherhood that had once caused thousands to starve had been crushed under Moore’s boot. The Legion had fallen without grace after decades of slavery and injustice had ruined the Arizonan wastes, just like their ancient namesake they were nothing but forgotten history. After all her enemies fell helplessly at the knees of order and justice it was only befitting that a parade were to be held in her name.\nShady Sands would be the location of her great and final triumph, the crowds reached sizes the wasteland had never seen. Entire divisions were present at the parade, proud to serve under the woman who they once fought side by side with. The sandstone arches of the great city had never been host to a military presence this large within the city since the weeks that encompassed President Tandi’s funeral.The occasion would live up to the legacy of her death however, as hundreds of California’s enemies would be walking the street in chains regretting having ever served their cruel masters. Knights and Legionaries alike would be flanking each other in shame as they were spat on, however the true highlight of the occasion was once the greatest threat to the state that was now a shadow of his former self, Calhoun.\nHis visage no longer carried colour as he had grown pale and frail in the long and seemingly never-ending time he had been held in chains. The memory of his bravery at the Battle of Boneyard had faded into obscurity as he was now only remembered as a weak excuse of a man. The crowd was driven with rage as they asked for his head on a pike while a very small number looked on with melancholy at the once proud revolutionary.Thankfully mercy had its final word on the battered and tired follower, he was given notice by one of the soldiers that his death would be quick, a firing squad had been chosen as the method. A rough and unmarked coffin had been prepared for him and his grave had been excavated under a mutfruit tree. At the end of the parade it was reaching the early hours of night, ten soldiers lined themselves up as Calhoun faced the sandstone walls remembering his hardships. The crowd had already grown disinterested as a few hundred spectators still remained to watch his death. The last words he heard were “Fire!” as all but one of the shots hit his frail figure, no official funeral would be held."

  ncr_order.9.d:0 "A week after the opening of the Steel Hearts Memorial, the High Elder, as well as the majority of the Council of Elders who had been captured at Lost Hills, appeared in the still-rebuilding NCR Hall of Congress. Although Colonel Moore would have simply had them shot, President-General Moore knew that her people deserved justice. Justice would still end with the end of their lives, but charging them with their crimes and humiliating the once-proud Brotherhood would satisfy some of her utter abhorrence for them.\nMoore stood at the top of the Congressional Seat, Grant C. Hayes sitting as stenographer, although the trial would likely not go on long enough to require more than a few sheets of paper.\n\nThe High Elder of Lost Hills, [BOS.GetLeader] took the stand first. Video and photo cameras zoomed in on them, reporters eagerly captured each and every angle of the worn and battered Elder. They couldn't even speak, lest Moore spin their words to create further persecution against them.\n\n"'High Elder', you are charged, alongside your so-called 'Council'-" Moore spat the words with detest and sarcasm. "-With crimes of the highest nature against not only the New California Republic, but also the Third California Republic. I would ask you to plead, but I believe that the jury, as well as myself, have no need for such extensions. Instead, I would like to take this time to drive your attention towards the good people of the TCR, both here and across the nation."\n\nThe cameras zoomed from the High Elder to the individual Elders. They had opted for defending themselves, though the TCR didn't have a strictly established legal system, let alone lawyers. The effort may have been a valiant one in the old NCR, but in the TCR, Moore and the rest of the nation only saw it as a futile excuse to attempt to give themselves one last moment of relevancy, before the age of the Brotherhood came to an end in the west."

Moore echoed this sentiment, banging her gavel on the stand.\n"Those of the Brotherhood, you have been found guilty of the multitudes of charges placed upon you. The sentence is death."\nAlthough the Hall of Congress was still being rebuilt, Moore saw no issue with some small temporary additions to the seats of the convicted.\n"Guards, please raise the seats of the Elders to their maximum heights." The guards did just that, raising each of the seats of the Elders to a height rivaling that of a Deathclaw Matriarch. The Elders had been hand and leg cuffed, so they could not move if they wanted to. As soon as the chairs were raised, large wood beams were unfolded from each of the seats, each of them with a noose laced to the tip.\n"If you'll be as so kind as to place the heads of the convicted into the nooses. Except the High Elder, I have a special plan for them.\n\nFrom the High Elder's seat, a steel beam unfolded. Then another beam. Once unfolded, a laser beam began emitting from between the tops of the beams. Moore shoved the neck of the High Elder between the beams. "You shall witness as your compatriots are given the righteous punishment of the Third California Republic, before we the people witness the end of you, and the end of the Brotherhood, once and for all.\nWith that, the Elders' heads placed in nooses, and the laser beam quickly descending on the High Elder, the whole of the TCR watched as the Elders were hung, one after the other."

First, not only was he slated with exactly the same amount of votes as the tax whale Kimball and the "free man" stooge Allgood, but now he had been informed that, due to electoral imbalance, the election was now at a deadlock, a first in NCR history.\n\nSo, to make a bad day slightly better, Hayes had his secretary take the week off, put one of his many advisors in charge until further notice, and began leaving town. Although being the Mayor of Dayglow was a very boring and tedious job, he had learned of a very important development while sitting in a council meeting.\n\nApparently a ghoul had been caught wearing Enclave gear, and was pleading his case that he had found a Pre-War Enclave bunker, stacked to the brim with valuables, giving each member a crude map of how to get to it. Hayes, while having an interest in following up on the matter, was outvoted by the rest of the council, who had the ghoul committed to the Old Ghoul's Home.\n\nNow, however, with a failed election, he could take some time off and relax, let the insolent fools deal with their election, he had a bunker to find. Once he reached the spot, he stepped out of his mayoral Corvega Blitz, and began re-opening the door to the bunker.\n\nOnce open, he discovered the bunker was a rather misleading name for the complex. It may as well have been a Pre-War army depot. The complex was massive, with a holographic directory listing out 5 floors, each with over a dozen rooms.\n\nHayes was glad he had given his staff time off, he may be here for weeks, if not months..."

  ncr_order.12.t:0 "Hayes'd and Confused"
  ncr_order.12.d:0 "He'd finally done it. It had taken months, but Grant C. Hayes had finally explored the whole of the complex. He had started with the first floor, opening up crate after crate, unlocking locker after locker. While most of it was weapons and armor storage, he did come across some interesting cybernetics.\nThe second floor was far more interesting, seemingly the hub of the base's defense mechanisms, although long deactivated. The computers were also wiped, only offering basic terminal functions for the unpowered robot husks.\nThe third floor was the most boring, only offering a measly greenhouse and food storage area, which Hayes came to be grateful for, only having a few weeks worth stored in his card, but was otherwise unremarkable.\nThe fourth floor seemed to have been a storage area for genetic mutation testing, though, like the second floor, all logs were wiped, and all potential experimentation equipment taken away, leaving only signs and reminders.\nThe fifth floor was the officer's quarter, and while it did have a terminal, it only told Hayes what he had come to guess already, that the complex was being abandoned, though he was uncertain if the timeframe of the abandonment was before the Great War, or during the NCR-Enclave War.\n\nSatisfied with his work, Hayes ventured out of the bunker for the first time in months. His already pale skin had somehow become even more pale, giving a slight burning sensation when exposed to the sun. Hints of stubble and hair also pocked Hayes' face. He had brought essentials, but luxuries like a razor were not available to him in the bunker.\n\nHowever, the most intriguing thing was the state of his car. Or rather, the lack of it. In its place was a tall signboard, with a woman's face on it. The poster was deep red and black, with big red letters reading "The Luxury Of Stagnant Diplomacy Is Over", with black and red stars adorning the corners.\n\nHayes swore he recognized the woman from somewhere, though he also had to admit she did look particularly... attractive. Although he was annoyed at his car being removed, he was curious what had happened to the NCR since he had been gone."

  ncr_order.13.d:0 "Moore looked over the state of Junktown. In the past century since it was first visited by the Vault Dweller, the town had become rather infamous for its reputation, with the popularity of 'Tales of a Junktown Jerky Vendor' representing the town as a place where greed and violence were met with equal violence, while the reality of the town wasn't very far off. However, while Gizmo's influence on the town remained, the Darkwater family retained power, though after the town became a part of the state of Shady, the Darkwater's frontier justice was instead exchanged for the prospect of prison and judicial justice.\n\nThe Junktown jail, once a small tin shack for drunks and would-be miscreants, had long since transformed into the Junktown Detention Center, a place where the ne'er-do-wells of Shady and neighboring states were housed when Max-Sec became too full, or the crimes they committed were either political or absolutely heinous in nature. The man Moore was looking for was said to be guilty of both. But Moore knew that the NCR had always been too soft when it came to the treatment of infidels when it came to the rule of law, not to mention that she needed trained and capable military generals, and the man who should still be in here fit that exactly.\n\nRoger, also known as 'Ratboy', was an oft-cited figure in the Mojave Campaign, with his battalion, the 'NCR Exiles' operating shortly after the Peterson administration declared retaliation for the Mojave murders. Although he was praised by Brahmin Barons and Gun Runners alike for his exceptional performance and quick action, unknown to most of the citizenry of the NCR, he got his results through what would be called horrific scenes of mass-murder. Though his targets largely remained within raiders and violent tribals, after 15 years of extermination, his vigor was taken away from him when then-General Aaron Kimball completed the 'Pacification of the Mojave' in Bullhead City."

Since then, he had remained there, waiting for any updates on his sentence. Although he was initially set to serve for life, at the age of 47, his military service earned him a dishonorable discharge, while he would be set to be reformed within the JDC, though with orders to transfer him to Max-Sec if he got too rowdy.\n\nRoger's attempted rehabilitation was mostly person-to-person, with a designated therapist meeting with him, although his stories of war, extermination, and taste for violence earned him a reputation of going through approximately a dozen therapists per month, including short-circuiting a Ms. Nanny brought in, which resulted in the additional murders of half a dozen prison staff. However, as the Ms. Nanny caused it, and not Roger, he was unable to be transferred as of yet.\n\nDespite his reputation, the JDC continued functioning, albeit with a hastily-constructed maximum security cell made to accommodate the man. This cell was one of the few left unopened after the NCR's electoral deadlock was announced, with many of the low and medium-security prisoners let go. The guards hoped that, by leaving the maximum security prisoners to rot, they would do the nation a service. But Moore didn't want Roger going to waste, nor any of the Exiles who had been imprisoned with him.\n\nUsing an electronic lockpick she had obtained from the now-former Mayor-Warden Darkwater, she opened the maximum security cells.

"Mr. 'Pre-War fanatic' found himself a box of Gold Medal crayons, and decided he wanted to draw up how Oregon used to look, and how it looks now."\n\nThe map itself depicted various shapes decorating the state, from where Portland, Salem, and other major cities stood, to where the NCR had both full occupation, and where resistance still faced them, represented appropriately by green smiley faces and red frowny faces.\n"I need a person who can take these 'Frontier' outcasts, and civilize them the way the NCR ought have when we first brought Klamath under our wing. No dumb comic book characters, crab monsters, or wizards of some lake, not even a mention of those Brotherhood freaks in the city. For this, I need you to take over with your 'NCR Exiles' to head up the Frontier. You'll be given all the resources you need. Plus a little something extra."\n\nRatboy adjusted his cap, raising an eyebrow. "And what might that be?"\n\nMoore looked over at a ceramic thorny black rose that had been brought back from Portland, a symbolic representation of the Pre-War Portland Rose Festival, and the general feelings of the Sino-American War at the time. She took it from its spot, and handed it to Roger. "I'm inaugurating you and your men with a new name. No longer will you be the NCR Exiles, you'll be the Black Thorns of the Northern Frontier. Representing all the values of the Third California Republic. Might get a fancy Vertibird fleet on top of that, assuming you can restore one of those airports."\n\nRoger took the ceramic rose, placing it in his cap.

  ncr_order.16.d:0 ""Truck in position." A voice reported from the radio outside Hidden Valley. Moore approached, clad in modified riot gear, as most of the soldiers were. She wasn't about to let the Brotherhood slip through her grasp. Hayes was busy managing Ratboy's unorthodox methods back in the NCR, so it was only Moore and a group of Exiles who were monitoring the site. Moore mentally kicked herself for not knowing of this location, as well as the continuing failures of the old NCR government that allowed for these things to happen. But no more, under her Third California Republic, which had already been dealing with Lost Hills, the Brotherhood would be taken out.\n\nDue to Hayes' fierce passion for the Old World, he had been the one to alert Moore to where Hidden Valley was, and how it had stayed hidden for so long. It turned out that Pre-War records obtained from captured Brotherhood holodisks revealed the existence of the DERVISH camouflage system, which the Brotherhood had been using on full blast for the past 10 years. But a simple manufactured sandstorm can only last for so long. Hayes had calculated the exact date of the system's failure, ensuring that the TCR would have no problem surrounding all possible exits and entrances into the bunker hub.\n\nHayes' calculations were not wrong. As soon as Moore arrived, on a hot afternoon, the sandstorms previously masking the location suddenly began to lessen in ferocity, until they died down to nothing more than a hollow echo of what once was a violent sea of sand. Moore did not want to take any chances with the Brotherhood though, and had taken extra precautions to ensure their death. Although impersonal, it would at least assure that all of them would no longer be a problem.\n\nMoore placed her fingers on the riot comm-piece. "Release the neurotoxin." The tank truck, brought from California, had been pumped full of a combination of toxins from across California and the Mojave, from the venom of a Nightstalker and Cazador, to the toxic blood of the Wanamingo. The mix ensured that not even Power Armor filters would stop their imminent demise."

For too long, the NCR had relied on nothing more than infantry. Armed with nothing more than ballistics and steel. They didn't even have more than one actual NCR-made Vertibird, for Dharma's sake! But all that was about to change...\nWithin the factory, Moore proceeded over to what had once been retired General Drummond's personal blueprints and documents. However, since the good general was no longer around, Moore saw no reason that they couldn't be put to use. The blueprints in question depicted what Drummond had referred to as the 'Desert Combat Tank'. Moore had a better name, now that she had all the unused and rusting Power Armors from both Lost Hills and the Mojave Chapter: The 'Power Armored Tank'.\n\nIn the engineering wing below, the construction of the PAT was going smoothly. Power Armor steel, ceramics, servos, and other materials were carefully disassembled into individual pieces. From there, they were fixed and adjusted for larger scale use. So far, only the chassis was truly finished, but once it was finished, the PAT was going to change the face of warfare in the TCR.\n\nThe name wasn't just for intimidation to the Brotherhood they may encounter either, once powered, the PAT could deflect not only calibers exceeding 80mm rounds, but also up to 100 megawatts of laser and plasma attacks. Not only that, but it had a modified V12 diesel-fusion engine, allowing for it to gain bursts of energy, predicted to exceed 15 MPH, more than enough for perfect ramming speed. Finally, with a souped up engine and supreme deflection, the tank had a special addition given to it by Hayes, who had recently become fascinated with the works of Nikolai Tesla.\n\nShould the tank be attacked with wattage exceeding 100 MW, it could deploy Tesla Enhancers, allowing its cannon to discharge a special energy round that was guaranteed to decimate any and all foes."

And after the completion of this statue, the people of the TCR would finally have a reason to celebrate.\n\nAlthough the name of the statue was always to be titled 'Triumph of the Third Republic' by Hayes, disagreement had stirred on what the statue should actually be. Unlike the flag of the TCR, Moore did not want to have options, she wanted to pick a single option, and stick with it. Hayes had suggested a statue of Moore, but Moore, while the idea of memorializing herself seemed tempting, felt it was not representative of the Republic or herself. Moore wanted to depict a Brotherhood of Steel Paladin being torn apart by the TCR itself. Ratboy was the one to solve both problems.\n\n"How 'bout a three-headed bear?" He had said.\n\nThe idea seemed so simple now that it had been put out there. Although three-headed bears weren't exactly a realistic image for the wasteland, it wasn't like two-headed bears were able to be seen either, yet the old NCR had been associated with the image of a two-headed bear for almost a century. And so the plan was underway. A three-headed grizzly bear, marked with subtle markings of the TCR, was constructed, tearing a Brotherhood of Steel Paladin limb from limb. Hayes and Moore especially bonded over how brutal the statue could be, but Ratboy had to break the news to both of them that using actual corpses and 'rivers of Brotherhood blood' would be rather unsanitary and unsavory for viewers.\n\nThe compromise had come in constructing the Brotherhood statue from each armor set from the various Brotherhoods that had been exterminated. T-45, T-51, Air Force Power Armor, T-60, and dozens more, had been forged and welded, until the suit finally came into shape."

  ncr_dharma.1.d:0 "To much dismay of Mossman, Calhoun was not present at the Boneyard. Spared from the onslaught, he knew Mossman would come for him next. He was probably one of the last remaining opposition to the council now. Still, in a makeshift hospital of the Followers of the Apocalypse in Dayglow, Calhoun contunied to tend his patients. Due to the neglect of Dayglow, many of its residents died from preventable ailments like radiation sickness. \n\n 'Poor boy' he thought, looking at the boy in front of him, waiting for his demise in utter silence. He was an orphan, like many other, scavenging places no adult could fit in for a meager payment. On one that like any other, he got stuck in a reactor room, only to be rescued by a ghoul who heard his pleas. When the ghoul brought him to the Followers, it was already too late. There wasn't enough supplies to treat him. His blood cells were dying and despite all the blood transfusions there was no signs of recovery. \n\n 'Two people, waiting to die' he thought. They both accepted their deaths. 'Thank you' whispered the boy 'for everything', as he drew his last breath. Calhoun collapsed to the chair next to the hospital bed in sorrow, listening to the roar of the vertibirds in the sky. He listened to the footsteps of the rangers, getting closer and closer. A lone figure opened the door, with the gun pointing at him. \n\n§R'Hello, raggedy man'§!"

He expected his execution, not salvation. He knew Angela, she was one of the original Desert Rangers assigned to train the new ranger corps in Boneyard area. §R'Moore killed Mossman'§! she exclaimed. §R'We risked so much to save you.'§! Only then he realised Angela was limping, with blood dripping from her right leg. §R'We were the closest to your location. We intercepted a ciphered communication from the HQ, ordering your assassination. Unlike other rangers, we are not the ordinary rangers. Following the tradition of Desert Rangers, I chose my recruits from the volunteers who desired to be the shield of the innocent. We gathered whatever we can, and deserted. Every single one of us dedicated our lives to the people of the wasteland, not Moore.'§! He was shocked from all the developments. 'Get in' yelled Angela, pointing the armoured car outside. In a short span of time they reached the ranger safehouse near a small town. Several ranger squads were waiting for them. They all saluted him. Angela slowly got off the car.  §R'We are waiting for your orders, Mr. President'.§!"

Calhoun could have never imagined that his ideals would be guiding the wasteland to the future. However not all is said and done...\n\nWe find ourselves in the precarious situation of having to deal with the despot that wrought hell upon all who questioned her. If we want to maintain a semblance of order then a trial must be set up to decide the fate of Cassandra Moore. Will we execute the same cruelty she dealt to others or let justice have its way and let mercy have a chance of prospering?\n\nThe day of judgement grew near, the air was uncertain while the morning bells rang a sombre sound. A crowd had gathered outside of the Boneyard Justice Centre that was filled to the brim with enraged revolutionaries who wished to see Moore’s cold and limp corpse hanging by the end of the day. Calhoun would have to face the lone and shackled tyrant amongst the riled masses and make his final decision. He risked letting her off leniently by letting her sympathizers in the military take hold amongst the court and would have to choose between 'justice' and the people's will."

I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into the radio, and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.\n\n This grave act of betrayal came not from our enemies, but from those we trusted to protect us from our enemies. Now they hold our wills at a gunpoint. It is time to show them that it is not the people who should be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.\n\n So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest that you allow the Great March to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me, one week from tonight, in every city of the republic, and together we shall give them a demonstration of the power of the people, that shall never, ever be forgotten.\n\nDeath to tyrants!"

I finally faced the monstrosity I had created and could barely form a phrase, but I knew what had to be done. The moment that lasted a century in my mind ended in the pull of a trigger. I closed his dead eyes and carried his body to a nearby juniper tree as my soldiers watched.

They spared no expense on it, having gathered all the gold and marble you can find in the modern day wasteland to construct the miniature monolith. There was not even a mention of the name of the Follower that travelled east, simply the word “CAESAR” that left an imprint bigger than a brahmin. After reminiscing on our time spent together I wondered if it would be too generous to the tyrant’s legacy if we left his mausoleum standing...\n\nAnswer:\n\nTear it down to honour the memory of Edward Sallow.\n\nI’ll let Caesar be remembered by all for who he became."

We both charged headfirst into his personal room and made sure his guard fell victim to my .50 calibre rounds. Graham and I stood over a cloaked figure that barely resembled the friend we once knew, we both looked at each other wondering what to do...\n\nAs we both looked at the pale ghost of a human we both once held dear we felt pity. We were partially to blame for his ambitions and fiery ego. His cold eyes stared at us as he carried an almost maniacal smile on his grim face. The husk of Edward Sallow laid in front of us and it only took a few moments for us to decide that neither of us had the willpower to put an end to our former friend, his tyrannical rule was as much of our fault as it was his.

  ncr_dharma.14.t:0 "A Chance Meeting"
  ncr_dharma.14.d:0 "Llwyd engaged the communications array, waiting nervously for the antiquated systems of the bunker to connect to the NCR's satellite. Calhoun of the new 'Californian Way' had sent a personal messenger to discuss the terms of opening a potential mutual relationship between the Californian Way and Lost Hills, but Llwyd was not one for face-to-face meetings, at least when it came to a group that had once been friends, turned enemies, and now requesting friendship once more.\nHis thoughts were interrupted as the "Please Stand By" screen turned to a visage of Calhoun's face. Llwyd had to admit, he had not expected the man to know how to use the video call format so quickly, believing that he would have had to walk him through turning on the video feed and making sure the microphone worked. Nevertheless, Llwyd began with a simple acknowledgement. "You're coming through loud and clear, Mr. Calhoun."\n\nCalhoun shook his head. "Please, Elder Llwyd, we may be strangers to each other, but far as I'm concerned, this is a call between friends-to-be. Call me Bill."\n\nLlwyd nodded. "Alright, Bill, you're coming through loud and clear."\nCalhoun fished several pieces of paper from a folder on the desk, holding them up to the camera for Llwyd to see. "Now, hopefully this is coming through alright, but I've personally drawn up some of the terms of our potential cooperation. It's not too terribly long, though I'll give you a minute to read through them."\n\nLlwyd's eyes shifted back and forth, taking in the meaning, both direct and those that may have had more between-the-line interpretations, of the compiled documents. He was no stranger to drawing up documents that had more than one meaning or interpretation, though it did result in him gaining a sneaky or snake-like reputation to some. Once satisfied that the documents didn't contain any hidden meanings or arrangements that would result in the Western Brotherhood's full dissolution, Llywd nodded his head, put his full attention back up to the camera, and gave his response to Calhoun."
  ncr_dharma.14.a:0 ""You have the full cooperation of the Brotherhood, Bill.""
  ncr_dharma.14.b:0 ""I'm afraid I can't accept these terms, Mr. Calhoun.""

  ncr_dharma.141.t:0 "Cooperation of the Brotherhood"
  ncr_dharma.141.d:0 "Since the passing of what has been referred to some in Congress as the "Brotherhood Cooperation Act", though others derogatorily refer to it as "Calhoun's Biggest Mistake", the Brotherhood of Steel have emerged from Lost Hills, and began resuming the practices they were once reputed for long before the declaration of war. While many still have hateful sentiments towards the Brotherhood, many more are thankful that they are able to cook toast in peace, without fear of their toasters being seized by the Brotherhood.\nThe Act did not come without some controversy, as some hardliner Brotherhood troops have since attempted to return to the circumstances that began the war in the first place, by demanding that troops and civilians of the NCR hand over any and all energy weapons that they might be in possession of. Though no blood has been spilled as of yet, both Calhoun and Llwyd have promised that previous hostilities represented in the sentiments of these more hardline soldiers do not represent the spirit of the BCA, and will be reprimanded and properly punished for their behaviors.\n\nThe most controversial aspect, however, was that the cooperation between the NCR and Brotherhood did not fully realize the potential sharing of technologies between the two. Many expected that the partnership would result in NCR soldiers being outfitted in proper Power Armor and equipped with top-of-the-line energy weapons. Instead, the so-called Steel Rangers have only presented the NCR with assistance to their own technological developments, claiming that they were unable to provide the technologies that they had used for so long as the Brotherhood of Steel.\n\nRadicals within NCR states are advocating for a full search of Lost Hills and any nearby affiliated groups, such as the Guardians in Nevada, believing that Llwyd may simply be hiding the schematics or stashes of advanced Brotherhood technology in the same way that many in the NCR believe that the Brotherhood are continuing to hide their stolen NCR gold reserves. Both Llwyd and Calhoun deny this to be the case."

Calhoun refused to elaborate on what specifically drove the Elder, who had seemingly been pushing for leadership reform and cooperation with the former NCR for the duration of his Eldership, to decide to forego what seemed to be his entire purpose and life goal. Current theorists believe that Llwyd experienced a temporary bout of insanity, due to sustained stresses of leadership and other circumstances within the Brotherhood, but the truth is not known at this time.\n\nThe Californian Way continues to advocate for non-violent and peaceful means of handling situations, but the refusal of the Brotherhood is one of the rare instances that both Californian and Follower alike believe that, after repeated hostilities and unwarranted aggression, the tensions with the Brotherhood are higher than ever. Calhoun continues to advocate for peaceful protest of the Brotherhood, but rumors from within the Followers believe he himself is creating a war plan in order to deal with the Brotherhood once and for all.\nIn a related story, Brotherhood hardliners, having seemingly agreed with Llwyd's refusal, have taken to leaving Lost Hills on what can only be described as raiding missions. Traders, settlers, and mercenaries alike report being faced with three or more Brotherhood soldiers, and asked to hand over any and all technology they have, be it a Pip-Boy, a laser pistol, or a waffle iron. Those who have attempted to resist or fight back have been met with immediate disintegration."

  ncr_dharma.15.d:0 "The reformist leader of the Brotherhood of Steel sat in a mildly uncomfortable steel chair. While Calhoun had tolerated the idea of a video call the first time, he peacefully, but directly, insisted that Llwyd meet with him in person. Which was why Llwyd now found himself sitting in the "dean's" office of the Followers Boneyard Medical University, which had become a sort of routing neutral zone for many Californian affairs since the dissolution of the New California Republic. Llwyd did take some pride when Calhoun came in, sitting in a chair of the exact same make, and experiencing the same mild discomfort he was experiencing.\n\nPutting his hand up, Calhoun shifted around in his chair. "Before you start, I know, the chairs. I've been asking for more caravaneers to try and salvage either Pre-War office chairs, or materials to make them, but the people would rather not give them any more influence than they're getting in Redding. Even if it's to give us more comfortable places to sit."\n\nLlwyd nodded. "But the chairs weren't what I wanted to discuss, Bill. You mentioned having an addendum to our cooperation?"\nCalhoun nodded. Taking a sealed capsule out from his satchel, he popped open the lid, removing a rolled up piece of fabric, which unfurled to reveal an emblem of what appeared to be the traditional insignia of the Brotherhood logo, the winged circle and sword, mixed with the old version of the New California Republic Rangers flag, with three lines, and the silver star of the Rangers at the center.\n\n"The Steel Rangers. A simple idea, but one with so much meaning behind it. I know that you've been holding out on me, and I can understand why. But you can help me to help you. All I ask is that you grant the Californian Way the ability to utilize your fancy Circle of Steel gear and specialized Combat Armor. You're not doing this out of the good of your heart, I know more than enough what kind of people that sort of thinking can lead to. But this is the last thing I will ask of you and your people.""

  ncr_dharma.151.d:0 "Once, a partnership between the NCR and Brotherhood was well underway. That was until the NCR made the fateful decision to utilize energy weapons, which resulted in the Brotherhood declaring war on them in order to maintain their alleged monopoly on advanced technologies. For decades, this war went on without end, as Brother fought against Ranger, each side taking massive morale losses. With the fall of the NCR and the rise of the Californian Way, however, this partnership has not only returned, it's thrived.\n\nFor the first time in what may as well be centuries, long-time Brotherhood soldiers are able to retire, in order to let the younger generation of both Brotherhood and Californian step into their Power Armored shoes. Carrying the torch of democracy was once thought to be only the responsibility of the NCR, but even a massive torch needs more than a single hand to carry it. The formation of the Steel Rangers has resulted in an almost unprecedented improvement of relations between the two groups, as quality of life, training, and equipment have skyrocketed across the nation.\n\nThe decision has not come without controversy, however, as Lost Hills has begun the process of being dismantled, in order to solidify relations between the two groups. While the former state of Maxson has pledged to take any and all historical artifacts from the disassembly to create a form of museum and historical site of Lost Hills, many within the Brotherhood have mixed feelings on losing their core, even if it means gaining a new friendship with the Californian Way."

Despite cooperation, little progress has been made in resolving the decades-long feud between NCR and Brotherhood, even if the former no longer exists. Calhoun stated that the main appeal of the Steel Rangers was apparently not the breaking point, but rather in asking the Brotherhood to hand over some of their technologies for use by the Californian Way.\n\nElder Llwyd was seen silently walking out of the Boneyard University, his face as blank as a sheet of paper, and seemingly blank to the rest of the world. When approached for comment, Llwyd was uncertain in responding, eventually leaving the city via taxi. In the time since the announcement, tensions between Brotherhood and Californian have flared up slightly, despite previous insistence that the cooperation would put an end to such instances. While no active aggressions or hostilities have been taken, one wonders if the Brotherhood holding onto their identity will result in the same circumstances that resulted in the collapse of the NCR."

  #Election results
  ncr_election_results.1.t:0 "Grant C. Hayes Elected President of the NCR"
  ncr_election_results.1.d:0 "A season of simultaneous apprehension and enthusiasm has befallen the West, and the news came out of New California as quickly as it manifested - the New California Republic, founded on the values and institutions of the Old World, swallowed its own tail with the election of Grant C. Hayes. Preoccupied with every point in time save for the present, the incoming administration promises sweeping changes to the social and economic fabric of the Republic. Observers regard the incoming administration with astonishment, the most learned citing the promised implementation of developed economic systems not seen in practice since before the Great War to forecast an imminent golden age for the Republic. \n\nFew understand precisely what an inflation is, nor what constitutes contractionary or expansionary monetary policy, yet cautious optimism permeates the general atmosphere - though many do regard with disquiet the government’s inexplicable stated intention to fondle, squeeze and pull on their hard-earned money."

  ncr_election_results.2.t:0 "Allgood Murphy Elected President of the NCR"
  ncr_election_results.2.d:0 "A profound sense of relief first permeated New California, then extended outwards across the west  - Allgood Murphy has secured his position as President of the New California Republic, heralding a welcome end to the jingoistic policies which previously defined the character of the nation. Although critics suggest that the new, more cooperative foreign policy of the Republic will render it susceptible to exploitation and invasion, the general atmosphere is one of elation, as the apprehension has vanished from within the Republic that one may be sent to die in the pursuit of any number of undefined, wholly superfluous campaigns of conquest abroad, whereas those outside of the Republic may now feel more secure in their continued autonomy. \n\nThe New California Republic, in this connection, has exchanged its prior state of defensive autarky in favor of a more cooperative defensive policy, manifesting the portent of a more complicated situation for potential invaders.."
  ncr_election_results.2.a:0 "All is good in New California."
  ncr_election_results.2.b:0 "The Bear has grown much kinder."

  ncr_election_results.3.t:0 "Aaron Kimball Elected President of the NCR"
  ncr_election_results.3.d:0 "Many stood with baited breath for the news to come out of California - when it did, it seemed at once electrifying and expected. Aaron Kimball has secured his position as President of the New California Republic, confirming the trajectory of the young nation and setting in stone the ongoing sequence of conquests further eastward from the Pacific coast. Outsiders of the Republic watch with terrible and brooding disquiet, as it has become immediately obvious that further expansion of the Republic has become non-negotiable, and it is more a matter of when, rather than if, any resisting nation is trampled underfoot.. \n\nThe torch of liberty burns brightly, yet it now remains to be seen whether its flame will shine as an inspiration, or if it will burn the shaky foundation of civilization into ash for a second time."
  ncr_election_results.3.a:0 "We will grow further than ever, from sea to shining sea."
  ncr_election_results.3.b:0 "The Bear is roving out across the West."

  ncr_election_results.4.t:0 "Electoral Deadlock in the NCR"
  ncr_election_results.4.d:0 "At first, many waited with great enthusiasm and unease for the results of the ongoing election in the New California Republic to be announced. It had seemed as though all certainty had vanished, save for the tacit understanding that the destiny of the Republic would be enshrined, and that the will of the people would be recognized as it always had. \n\nAnd yet, as the election drew on, a great and terrible sense of trepidation began to dominate the general character of New California - the general anxiety was horrible, and over the desert loomed a specter of imminent and physical danger. Nights swept by, and the apprehension became a source of public nuisance for those who pretended to sleep. Each day, the Senate bickered, and votes shifted like desert sands in the wind. Still, a majority inevitably failed to manifest, and the bickering continued. As time passed, it became abundantly clear that the New California Republic had, for the first time in its history, faced absolute electoral deadlock."
  ncr_election_results.4.a:0 "Our Republic may be swallowed by strife."
  ncr_election_results.4.b:0 "The Bear has grown sick - vultures circle overhead."
