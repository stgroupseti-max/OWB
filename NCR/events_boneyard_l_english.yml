  nf_boneyard.18.d:0 "The Boneyard is a curious place; the heart of the NCR's war machine, but also home to the pacifists of the Followers. [BON.GetLeader] has come to us with a proposed deal, hoping to build on First Citizen Lynette's time there. The Boneyard will provide us with military equipment in exchange for access to some of our civilian technology. Given the need to stand on our own two feet, perhaps we should consider this offer? As Lynette knows from her time there, they are rather civilized, for Californians."

  nf_boneyard.19.t:0 "Tales From the Vault"
  nf_boneyard.19.d:0 "Vault City is no paradise, but it has come a long way from the 2240's. Whatever their feelings towards the NCR's foreign policy, we have shown that we can build ties based upon sharing ideas and ammunition. The Gun Runners' shipments have left us well compensated with medical equipment. And surely [VLT.GetLeader] would never be so foolish as to threaten the Bear."

  nf_boneyard.20.t:0 "[VLT.GetLeader] Disappoints"
  nf_boneyard.20.d:0 "While we would have hoped Vault City learned from decades of NCR oversight, their leader has rejected our proposed trade agreement. On the upside, the Gun Runners will invest their resources in the Boneyard instead."
  nf_boneyard.20.a:0 "Good luck with your raider problem."

  nf_boneyard.21.t:0 "Trade With the Boneyard"
  nf_boneyard.21.d:0 "The Boneyard is a curious place; the heart of the NCR's war machine, but also home to the pacifists of the Followers. [BON.GetLeader] has come to us with a proposed deal, hoping to build on our people's ties to the region. The Boneyard will provide us with military equipment in exchange for access to some of our civilian technology. Perhaps this is the start of warmer ties between the home of the Followers and the Vault Dweller's family?`"

  nf_boneyard.22.d:0 "The poor people of Arroyo, scattered after something happened to Vault 13, have found a new home in the north. Remaining true to the Vault Dweller's ways, they have agreed to a trade agreement between the Boneyard and their new home. Perhaps we can bring "

  boneyard_good_desc:0 "The Boneyard calls itself California's Conscience, and Allgood Murphy is the latest in a long long of compassionate leaders or bleeding hearts, depending on who you ask. And he may save the NCR."

  boneyard_guns_start:0 "Protecting the Boneyard"
  boneyard_guns_start_desc:0 "The Boneyard never had a strong military of its own, for better or worse. But the Gun Runners and the Blades were enough to protect them. Facing threats from raiders and concerns about Shady Sands' total war, [BON.GetLeader] must decide how to protect the Republic."
  boneyard_gun_runners:0 "The Unofficial Branch of the Army"
  boneyard_gun_runners_desc:0 "The Gun Runners have been putting rapid-fire death-dealing in the hands of anyone who needed to defend himself for over a century. They're the NCR's #1 supplier of weapons and ammunition, and you might call them an unofficial branch of the army."

  boneyard_hub_1:0 "The Hub of the Republic"
  boneyard_hub_1_desc:0 "Shady Sands' claims to be the heart of the NCR, but paper shuffling bureacrats are not the strength of the Republic. The people of the Hub are the power New California's economy and are, frankly, tired of Shady Sands corruption."

  boneyard_forgottenn_men:0 "The Old Ways for a New World"
  boneyard_forgottenn_men_desc:0 "For the past hundred years or so, the Followers have managed to get by using salvaged medical supplies from the Old World. But the side effect of medical success is that more people live longer. Funny how that works. Eventually, we'll run out of hospitals to loot. We need new ways to produce those supplies. Or maybe old ways, if this research goes anywhere."
  boneyard_forgottenn_men_tt:0 "This will unlock a decision where nations can trade caps for a limited access to the Followers' high-tech workshops."

  boneyard_crimson:0 "The Crimson Caravan"
  boneyard_crimson_desc:0 "The reason the Crimson Caravan is so powerful is because they are the best run caravan in California. The efficiencies of working with them are obvious, and while it may push some small companies out of business, that's the cost of progress."

  boneyard_bos:0 "The Brotherhood War"
  boneyard_bos_desc:0 "The war with the Brotherhood was, perhaps inevitable. They wanted a computer found in the ruins of the Glow; and we recognized it belongs to the people of California. Although the computer was destryed early in the war, the war continued. The Brotherhood has lost countless suits of power armour; but they destroyed the gold reserves of Redding and have laid waste to much of Maxson. Although the war has petered out, Brotherhood raids continue to harass Maxson, and Shady Sands still plots to break into Lost Hills. But Murphy wishes to change that."

  boneyard_dayglow:0 "Help With the Glow"

  boneyard_water_merchants_desc:0 "When the Republic's gold reserves were destroyed by Brotherhood raids to the point where new gold coins could not be minted during the war, the merchant consortiums of the Hub re-established their own currency, the veritable bottle cap, backed by water.

  boneyard_coops_desc:0 "While the Brahmin Barons dominate much of the Republic's agriculture, there are still plenty of small farmers. With proper assistance we can encourage these cooperatives throughout the land, encouraging small farmers to pool resources against the rich and mighty. And this is a model the Followers might apply elsewhere."
  boneyard_sun:0 "Electrification"
  boneyard_sun_desc:0 "Shady Sands asks our men and women to die for the Dam, but Follower engineering will help us electricify much of the Boneyard. Let them have the plant; we have the power."

  boneyard_friendly_lending_company_desc:0 "With the attack on the Republic's gold reserves, the financial system fell on hard times.

  boneyard_downtown:0 "Revitalize the Downtown"
