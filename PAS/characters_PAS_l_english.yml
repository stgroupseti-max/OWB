	PAS_CHIEF_WARDEN_SYLVIA_DESC:0 "Born to Warden parents, Sylvia has spent her entire life fighting slavers and cannibals in a desperate bid to keep the few settlers in Portland safe. Sylvia became 'Chief' Warden following the loss of Downtown Seattle to the Immortal's advancing forces: a bloody battle that cost the Wardens many of their best soldiers. After the downfall of Seattle, she and Julius got into a heated argument over what the Wardens were meant to do-- the last of a series of similar conversations-- and so she and her Wardens loyal to her eloped north into the Rockies. They have found company in good people in the mountains, who needed protection from numerous dangerous foes, even from other Wardens, most of which who have now turned into mercenary work in Spokane. Despite the general feelings about the Wardens of the White, Sylvia and her 'Foxtrot Uniform' continue to lend a helping hand both in and out of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nOne day, maybe, she will descend from the mountains and interrogate Julius Brandt about what he was thinking."

People don't like the Wardens— they never have, not even when they were busy fighting Miscounts in Seattle and cleaning the streets. Guess they just never had a reason to— it's not like we ever dressed to impress. \n\nIt was always about control, even when it didn't matter. Julius didn't give two shits about if people were starving or even if they had a place to sleep... Only if they sat down and stayed quiet. \n\nI tried to talk sense into him for years. I really did. I don't think he'll ever see things the way we do— he'll never care about people. Just about feeling important. \n\nThe more and more outspoken I was, the more he and the other old guardsmen scoffed at me. He and his loyals ended up calling me and the ones who agreed with me 'Foxtrot Uniform,' because we wouldn't "stop bitching" all the time. When we lost Seattle and split from Julius' Wardens, we took the name and whatever we could carry."

The Wardens just weren't interested in playing nice with much of anybody, even their own. Guess the pay off for two hundred years of not giving a shit was losing so bad we all scattered into the wind. \n\nStill, it feels like the more people we help, the more we drag ourselves through the mud. The Mountaineers here are kind, and willing to share whatever they have, but are we in the right to take it? We help out as best as we can, but at the end of the day, what does it say about us if we can't survive without them?

Making a living off of the land here has been an arduous process, but over time we have turned a ragtag group of survivors into a growing and respectable community, and we have begun communicating with other groups residing in the mountains around us. It is in that spirit of exploring the world around us that I am writing to you now in the hopes of formally opening relations and trade between our two peoples.\n\nGiven our newfound security in this region of the Rockies, we now ensure safe trade and transit between the Cascades and settlements south of us. As we are now able to expand upon our position in the mountains, our people and I wanted to invite you to join us in securing the safety of our passage. In return, the Niitsitapi will gain trade access to the Cascade’s resources and water that will help alleviate material concerns with your people, as well as gain our connections to other settlements who, like us, look to cooperate with others on many matters pertaining to the wellbeing of ourselves and our loved ones.\n\nThere have been many nights when I think about the kindness and charity that you had shown after our people fled Spokane, and just as many days thinking about how I can best repay that kindness to you, and to others who travel through our lands. If it aids you in making a decision regarding our invitation, please do not see this as a formal request from one leader to another. I am simply someone who has always tried to do right by those around her and will continue to do so. To that end, this letter is simply me thanking a friend of a like nature, as well as an opportunity for both of us to effectively care for those under our wings, like you had done for me.\n\nFeel free to contact us at your discretion. Simply send a courier with your flag to the mountain passage to your northwest and we will be sure to receive him.\n\nSincerely,\nChief Warden Sylvia"

Pulling out his pocket journal, he scratches off another callsign and frequency on a list of them. Maybe their ham radios were down, or the receiving parties were on the move? Regardless, he looks at the next callsign and frequency. He’d been given a task, and he’d carry it out in the hopes that it bore fruit. He sets down the journal next to the ham radio and points at the next frequency. “Try these next few ones, and raise them on the horn every few minutes.

Sylvia would chew him out to the end of time if she knew that he was reaching out to veteran Warden remnants after what remained of their forces pulled out of Seattle and scattered east. By re-establishing contact, he hoped, they could potentially bolster their numbers and ultimately strengthen their position in the mountains.\n\nOn one hand, he was finally glad that he had an unimpeded chance to do things his way. His time off the Oregonian coast and as a Warden showed him that war never changes and those who wage war better beat out over those who don’t. For all of their sakes, they needed to be the former. On the other hand, finding and enlisting the aid of old comrades in this manner was a crapshoot. Working ham radios were notoriously rare in the wasteland, and there was no way of knowing whether or not these handfuls of Warden troops were still alive out there.\n\nWilliam sighs. He’d rather be training new recruits right now, or even gang pressing people into joining up. Getting other people on board with him was important but was all this trouble really worth it?\n\n“Sir! Sir!” He perks up as the operator’s voice rang from within the building, full of excitement. “We just got a callback! Sierra Golf 5 in Safehaven, they picked up the horn!”\n\n‘Well, I’ll be damned,’ he thought, as he rushes back into the building."

It’s me, Dobson! Private Dobson, the courier!” The figure pulls his hood back to reveal a young man, his fearful eyes darting between William’s imposing figure, as well as the muzzle pointed squarely at him.\n\nWilliam sighs and lowers his rifle, thumbing his safety back on and thanking God that it was just some greenhorn private. “You need to sign and countersign, private. I was about to shoot you.”\n\nNow that domestic matters had become more manageable, it was time to begin looking outwards. Although he and Sylvia had managed to lead their people through many a difficult time, it became clear to him that their newfound stability was threatened, both by old foes to the west, and emerging threats from all around them. In the interest of their peace, William endeavored to take defense-related matters into his own hands, and that started with reaching out to Julius Brandt and the many Warden troops-made-mercs in the Spokane area. He would’ve preferred to do it himself, but with his leadership duties at home, William resorted to recruiting a young soldier who was intimately familiar with traveling around Spokane.\n\n“I-I’m sorry sir, I remembered you said you wanted to meet here and not in the main camp, but that’s about it.”"

Better yet, he was receptive to William’s plans and proposed an in-person meeting north of Spokane to talk things over. Brandt stated he’d bring his best men along, some of whom William remember from his days on the sea.\n\nHe folds the paper and stuffs it into his pocket. Very few things gave him joy these days, but the thought of linking up with his old comrades did brighten his day. “Commander Brandt wants to meet me in a few days time. Good job private.

Some of them have settled down, and you know how hard they’re all trying to make this work for them, for all of us.” She put her finger down on the table, a habit picked up from years of debating her superiors, her colleagues, her subordinates, and now William, co-leader of their people and, to her chagrin, her husband.\n\n“There are other settlements nearby and they’ve been able to survive here for decades. We can work with them and figure out how to feed-”\n\nWilliam scoffed. “And put ourselves at the mercy of others?

Caravans will stop going through the pass, and those that get hit will gun after you, and everyone else that we are trying to protect here! The last thing we need now is more trouble!”\n\n“Better we control our own supply of goods as opposed to relying on someone else.

Although life in the pass had exceeded what many of them had initially expected, the need for a larger administration to help facilitate trade and communication unfortunately accompanied that boom. Her position as Chief Warden made her the primary point of contact for many requests from the pass’ settlers as well as her own burgeoning administration, and soon enough she found herself trading her outdoor patrols for more time in her office.\n\nSylvia sighs. In her absence, William had effectively taken over her role regarding internal security and defense matters. Although he insisted that there was nothing noteworthy about his work there, she had heard that he had built up an impressive force for a group of their size. The next time she saw him, though, she’d have to ask about all the ammo requisitions he was putting in. It was perhaps the most common item that he had been requesting, perhaps outside of infantry equipment and other assorted military-spec goods.\n\nA quick knock at the door, and Sylvia’s eyes dart up from her paperwork. “Come in.” As it slowly opens, Will walks into the room, his demeanor unreadable.\n\nSylvia perks up, finally having the opportunity to ask. “Finally, there you are. I’ve been meaning to ask you about all these ammo reqs you’ve been putting in.” William stands across from her, stonefaced. In all the years that they’ve known each other, she can’t recall him being this unresponsive. Something in the back of her mind screams out that something is wrong, but she wants to at least try and get his attention again.\n\nShe stands up. “Hello? Earth to Will? I’m asking you about your requisitions.” As she finishes her sentence, Sylvia notices four armed men file into the room and line up behind William. She recognizes them as men from back during his time in Seattle. Men who he joined the Wardens with from his pirating days. She feels her stomach drop, and she begins sweating.\n\n“Will? What is this?”\n\nThe five of them continue to stare her down for what feels like an eternity. Finally, William opens his mouth, small traces of conflict beginning to work its way onto his face and betraying his stone-cold facade."

    nf_pas.24.d:0 "To: First Ecologist Sea-Bastion\n\nAlthough I hope that you forgive the sudden and unexpected nature of this letter, I do also hope that it has not arrived too late for you. My name is Chief Warden Sylvia, and I write on behalf of a growing collection of communities northwest of Yellowstone that currently resides in the Cascades. We help facilitate trade and communications between the various settlements living in the mountains, and it is in light of this fact that I write to you with a proposal.\n\nI am hoping to establish relations with your people and settlements to collaborate on shared interests. Trading and communicating with the nations that use our mountain pass will undoubtedly bolster your local economies and knowledge of the outside world. However, more pertinent to you may be the prospect of alliances. Although our understanding of your part of the world is limited, I understand that Yellowstone is surrounded by unpredictable and potentially dangerous parties, including a specter from the Old World.\n\nMy people and I are survivors of the wrath of such parties, and part of why we are reaching out is to not only start a beautiful partnership, but to build a bulwark against these malicious actors. It would be a great shame if this world’s last natural wonders were snuffed out by the follies of war. Together, we can help preserve this virgin land for future generations, while also protecting them from those who would wish harm upon them.\n\nGiven our lack of a shared border, please feel free to contact us at any time via ham radio. We can be reached at the enclosed frequency every other night at 3 AM. I look forward to hearing from you, and perhaps one day we can both show each other the beauty of our respective lands. After all, I’ve heard the Park is quite a sight to behold.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChief Warden Sylvia"

    nf_pas.25.d:0 "Sylvia stands before her husband, her betrayer, stunned. She wants this to be a nightmare so she can wake up and grill William about it, but her feelings and sensations right now are real. She wants him to say that it was all an elaborate prank, but nothing about his demeanor says he’s kidding.\n\nThe reality of the situation finally dawns on her, and the tears begin to freely run down her face. William has usurped everything they have worked together to build, and there is nothing she can do to stop it.\n\nInstinctively, he brings her in for a hug. Uttering profanities through her sobs and weakly beating her fist against his chest, she lets loose a torrent of emotions. He uses the last of his strength to signal to his posse to leave the room, and when they are alone he hugs her tight the emotions that he had been holding back throughout this encounter streaming down his face.\n\nHe holds onto her as if she would disappear if he let go, just as he had done during all those nights fighting in Seattle, when they ran east from Yakima, and when they fled from Spokane. He tightens his embrace, hoping that it can hold together everything he has broken here tonight. Maybe in time, Sylvia will understand.\n\nWilliam closes his eyes tightly, trying to shut out the freely flowing tears."

    nf_pas.23.d:0 "“You can’t be serious. I have no time for this crap Will, there’s-” Sylvia stammered out.\n\n“There’s nothing else for you to do now. You’re no longer Chief. I am.” William’s words are final and unwavering. He had played out this exact scenario in his mind hundreds of times before, but his usual bravado and fire that he imagined he’d have was nowhere to be found.\n\n“Fuck you, and fuck this sick joke. Guards-!” As if on cue, two figures, her security detail, collapse at the door frame, and Sylvia gasps.\n\n“Don’t worry, we only knocked them out. But this whole building is under our control, and the troops we have stationed around the pass answer directly to me now.” Will walks around Sylvia’s desk, maintaining eye contact the entire time. “All the guns, ammo, personnel, all of it are people that directly answer to me and my staff. You no longer control them.”\n\nHe is now face to face with her, his stoic appearance becoming harder and harder to maintain. He takes a breath to steel himself for the hardest part, and meets Sylvia’s frantic gaze with his own.\n\n“This is what’s going to happen. We’re exiling you to Yellowstone for an indefinite period of time. I’ve made arrangements with old contacts there, and they’ve given me word that they’ll keep you safe. I will make sure nobody harms you.” Each word he speaks cuts through her like butter, and the pain etched on her face only drives home the fact that he is stabbing her in the back.\n\n“This is for the greater good, Sylvie. For the best for all of us.” He wanted to tell his truth with that same finality that he started with, but a slight waver creeps into his voice in the last sentence. Telling the truth was never his forte, and the pain from the two of them is a stark reminder why."

    nf_pas.26.d:0 "Keegan taps his foot impatiently. The next caravan he was originally scheduled to escort leaves in 15 minutes, yet he and the other personnel were ordered to pull security to handle a growing crowd. Apparently the Chief Warden was supposed to make an appearance, and with that came the need to ensure a ruly crowd.\n\nHe frowns. Whatever the Chief Warden had to say, it had better be important for him to get his pay docked.\n\n“Yo, Keegan. Look alive.” His buddy nudges him and motions to Sylvia coming onto a small stage, followed closely by William. As they wave to the crowd and smile, Keegan can’t help but notice something off about their mannerisms.\n\n“For many years, I have had the privilege of having you all as the people that I would call family.” A brief pause, followed by a small round of applause. “To me, that family was, and will always be, the Wardens. We fled Seattle as the remnants of the Wardens there, and as we settled down here I always thought of us as Wardens.” Another pause, and Keegan can discern her features softening, while William’s remain as imposing as ever.\n\n“But something amazing happened. As we settled down here and planted roots, we began to create communities not defined by our past, not by the title of Warden, but by the world here and the world around us. I have had the privilege to watch these communities and you all grow, not as a Warden but as a steward. We never expected to survive the first few winters here, but looking at where you all are now, the people in the pass stand ready to take on anything and everything.” Another pause, and more applause. Sylvia purses her lips and closes her eyes, doing everything in her power to hold herself together. She exhales, opens her eyes, and continues.\n\n“It is with this reality that I have come to a very difficult conclusion. In a world and community that has outgrown the Wardens and their past, it is only fitting that there be no more Wardens to hold us back. Therefore, I come before you today to announce the official end of Foxtrot Uniform as an organization, We must leave our old symbols and banners behind, as we must not be beholden by our bloody past. We are something new and must move on from the old”"
