There, among empty aisles and flickering lights, he encountered a strange device: a red cash register that spoke in cheerful tones and offered him canned meat and Caesar salad kits.\n\nHe attempted to preach the will of Caesar, to speak of Mars’ favor and the glory of order brought by war. But the machine only responded with jumbled slogans and jingly music, proudly declaring ignorance of Caesar while promoting loyalty programs and “no-violence shopping zones.” It could not comprehend empire, only retail.\n\nVorenus grew agitated. He declared his bloodline descended from conquerors, his heart tempered in the fires of Flagstaff, but the machine only offered coupons. In the end, he stormed out, unchallenged, but deeply unsettled.\nHe returned to Lanius with a warning. 'The machines do not fear us, my lord. They do not *know* us. I say we burn this place. Let them learn of Mars in the crucible of flame.'"
