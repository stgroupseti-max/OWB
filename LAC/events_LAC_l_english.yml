Nothing else.\n\nA second courier came days later bearing a parchment marked with blood. In it, Lanius writes only: 'Let these suffice. If you wish for more, take it with your own hands.'\n\nThis is not rebellion in the manner of cowards or traitors. This is something stranger—colder.

With a mailed fist and wordless wrath, Lanius razed resistance and sewed obedience into the soil. Now, with the East pacified, he returns not in triumph, but in silence.
