  TOC_GROZDAN_HAYKOV_NAME:0 "Grozdan Haykov"
  TOC_GROZDAN_HAYKOV_DESC:0 "Grozdan Haykov was, before the Great War, a Bulgarian-born logistics wizard. One of many brilliant minds 'liberated' by the United States government shortly after Europe fell into civil war, Grozdan was posted to Spokane to assist with the ever-increasing logistical mess that was supplying the American garrison in Canada. Due to his importance he, like many other great minds that resided in Spokane, was assigned a spot in Vault 100. One of the first exposed to the radiaton that seeped into Vault 100 under Vault-Tec's orders, Grozdan quickly arose to become one of the leading figures of the ghoulish quater of Vault 100. A constant advocate for negotiation and descalation, even Grozdan was powerless to prevent the 'Great Revolt': an all-out civil war between the human and ghoul factions of Vault 100. When the humans finally broke out of the vault and fled east, Grozdan was left to pick up the pieces and attempt to forge a new Spokane."

  TOC_julius_brandt_name:0 "Julius Brandt"
  TOC_julius_brandt_desc:0 "§M"We offer safety. Not freedom."§! \n\nThough he'd never admit it, Julius once fought for America in the early years of the Canadian occupation. This only served to jade him, weathering him into a bitter, calculating man: one who would go on to form the Whitewarden Private Military Corporation. In a fit of cruel irony, the United States hired him and his sortie, sending them to Canada to occupy the Alaskan Pipeline and secure it from foes within and without. \n\nLittle did he know, then, that he and his men would be effectively stranded in the winter wilds as nuclear hell ravaged the world beyond recognition. Those who survived in his charge— including himself— had turned to ghouls, now clinging to their poorly-made, mass-produced black operations gear as the only sense of identity they still had. \n\nFor years, Julius led the Wardens to success in dominating Washington state, bringing a sense of power and control back to their name. Of course, as the Immortal had proven, this confidence had grown too big, and now he has to start from scratch all over again. If you asked how he was doing, he'd tell you he still misses the days when his greatest present issues were Olympus tribals and clever Yakama ploys."

  TOC_theodore_price_name:0 "Theodore Price"
  TOC_theodore_price_economic_advisor_desc:0 " Before the war, Price worked for the Northwest Commonwealth Electrical Concern. Their main goal was to fuel the infrastructure hub linking the United States and the recently annexed Canada. After the war, most of the plants were nothing more than a relic of the Old World, no fossil fuels left to burn in the rampant wastes. A single nuclear plant in Electric City operated, and Price aims to keep it running. Being almost as old as he was and still working to keep the lights on, he views the plant as a kindred spirit of sorts; A tether to a past that can't be broken just yet."

  TOC_joshua_nevin_economic_advisor_desc:0 "The Wasteland seems to have it out for Ghouls. Moving down from the hellscape of Alaska, Nevin was looking for a better life without persecution. What he found was more of the same, another place where his skin was a death warrant to some people. Arming himself and any other ghouls to the teeth, he is determined to spite all the bigots in Coure d'Alene simply by surviving."

  TOC_killian_nelson_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "The cold will strip the bravery off even the fiercest of men. Anything to insulate against the freezing wind is necessary to survive. To this end, trappers like Killian Nelson hunt the beasts of the brutal tundra to hold death at bay for just a bit longer."

That'll make them fall in line real quick."§!\n\nCorporal James Conor has stood by Julius' side for centuries: always stalwart, always ready. While Julius' rule has been called into the question in the past, James has always been the first to shut it down-- either by force, or otherwise."

Unless you have caps, we have nothing to talk about."§!\n\nHer brother says she's a lot nicer to those she knows, but that remains to be seen. While her brother handles a lot of the day-to-day of the Ice Picks, it's Jane's wit and quick-thinking that keeps them from falling prey to the other scavengers of the Whiteout. In her brother's own words, §R"without her, we'd be toast!"§!\n\nWe're inclined to agree."

  TOC_gunther_morris_advisor_desc:0 ""§gMy pops found Jane before I was born. He thought she'd be a better shot than food for the hounds. And me? He saw me as the perfect right-hand-man, but the raider's life just didn't cut it. I don't survive, I live. That meant cutting more deals than throats—painting the face with something pretty.\n\nPops didn't take that too kindly. "That stuff makes you half a man to me," he'd say.\n\nSo when I finally got to his face—with his Anchor Weights rallied against him, singing my type of tune, and with Jane pointing her gun at his temple—I asked him; "If I'm half a man, what does that make you?"\n\nOld fool couldn't even give me a straight answer.\n\nNow I've got my eyes set south. They say opportunities down south rain like flipping coins... If you can see past the nasty ghoulies and rabid lunatics, that is.§!" --Excerpt from §YGunther Morris§!' Personal Journal"

  TOC_bentley_name:0 "Pvt. William Bentley"
  TOC_bentley_advisor_desc:0 "§M"Look, between you and me, only one of us knows how to sling a knife out from under the sleeve. If you don't get what I mean by that, then anyone who's got their bets on me may as well already gotten their money doubled."§!\n\nPrivate William "Bill" Bentley is a simple man. As long as he gets a slice of Mutfruit pie at the end of every day, nothing else matters. His ranking serves as more of a point against the Wardens ranking system than one for it; despite his low class, he may as well be the secondmost important member of the Warden arsenal. As the unofficial right hand of Brandt, he has led many covert reconaissance missions behind enemy lines and been a main source of intel on troop movements and supply lines. Without him, the Wardens wouldn't be doing much else than squirming around in the snow, waiting to die."

  TOC_lionheart_name:0 "Liam "Lionheart" Harris"
  TOC_lionheart_advisor_desc:0 "§Y"Sometimes, I like to remind myself that if things had been different before all this, that if I had had more money, or if people gave a damn about people like me before the war... All I'd have ended up being was dead in some glorified hole in the ground. At least this way I can still make a damn difference."§!\n\nLiam Harris was once a sergeant in the United States military before the Great War. When the bombs struck, he and his unit were deep in a Canadian blizzard-- far enough to survive, close enough to become ghouls. After decades of wandering, he and his unit found their way to Spokane, where Grozdan gave them homes and friendship. Before the Wardens, they were the main custodians of peace, keeping the Rotpurgers vile schemes at bay, but now with Julius and his men things aren't as clear cut. A slight tension raises between the two groups, not palpable enough to result in chaos, but noticeable enough to cause repeated discomfort amongst the factions."

Well, sometimes a gun does the same damn thing, you know?"§!\n\nIsabella's always been a free spirit: a real believer in the human condition. She likes her life to have as many ups as it does downs, all because she says "it keeps things interesting." When Grozdan called her out for being an adrenaline junkie, she just laughed and said "you're just now figuring it out?"\n\nIf you ask Liam about her, he'd call her his right hand man: and if you ask anyone about anything more, well... Some things don't need to be said, do they?"

  TOC_timothy_tyler_advisor_desc:0 "§Y"If it ain't about to go boom... Then what the fuck are we doing, you know what I mean?"§!\n\nTimothy Tyler always had a funny old saying, something he picked up from one of his buddies back in Alaska: "Name's Anvilhead, and demolition is my mission." While he isn't the most original man on the block, he's got the heart to want to see the bad guys blow up, even if he's caught in the blast. What more could you want from a living folk hero?"

  TOC_john_ryan_advisor_desc:0 "§M"The fall of the Wardens was my fault, I crumpled like paper in their hands, and for that, I will fight to the death for my Warden brethren. Whenever that decides to grace my poor soul."§! \n\nWhen the Immortal began his occupation of Seattle, they took it upon themselves to punish those that would resist their rule— experimenting and executing as they pleased. Their first test subjects, of course, were the surviving Wardens.\n\nJohn was one of the first to wave the white flag, making him amongst the first of the captured in the eight-hour war. They rewarded his white flag with brutal interrogation, seeking the locations of Warden outposts.\n\nWhen they realized he honestly knew nothing of the Wardens that remained, they tried to kill him. But John, as he always does, survived. John, playing dead, planned an assault on the squad escorting him. He grabbed the nearest laser rifle, charging them, only to be captured yet again, and executed another time. Amazed at his ability to survive, they began experimenting on him again, turning the Warden into a favored lab rat.\n\nUpon escaping, he traveled until he met his fellow Wardens. Upon recounting his tales of two-timing and his newfound ability of an unkillable kind, they executed him for being such a stain upon their name. He arose once again, ready to serve, and eager to right his misdeeds against his brethren.\n\nAt least until he got to pry those pearly gates open..."
