Many of us-- namely, the 'Lost Boys' were clouded too heavily by the effects of their own bodily growth and the Red Fern's mutations. Many of them roam the woods, unable to comprehend themselves anymore. With luck, we may be able to persuade some to come back to their senses, or, even better, begin to find a cure to settle their minds."

These unfortunate victims are Lost Boys, male faeries driven deranged by their fluctuating hormones and the Red Fern's mutations.  Pleasantdale had banished all the male faeries from the city after the first case.  The remnants of these Lost Boys wander the woods, their minds clouded by a fever dream of violent delirium.  Though not all male faeries became Lost, what to do with them became a growing concern amongst the Glen-- were they worth risking?  Could they be... Cured?  Pattywack was unsure, but Faeries--in any form -- are family... right?"
