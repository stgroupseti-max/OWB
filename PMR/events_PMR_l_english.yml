  nf_pmr.1.t:0 "Hard Times in Port Maw"
  nf_pmr.1.d:0 "Wasn't always this bad here new fish; Port Maw used to be a, well, not a nice place I guess but it wasn't like this. There wasn't any organization or nothin' back then really, just folks. Most of those folks were just trying to live their lives, hold onto their little patch of dirt or sea shore and survive. We did have a mayor who set himself up, a fella named Dace, who was trying to get people to help him rebuild the old ruins and make something out of it but no one really paid him much mind. Who could really blame us though? The countryside was lousy with raiders and pirates and if you went too far south you'd find yourself in some cannibal's stew pot! \n\nIn those days we could survive because the different gangs fought each other as much as they fought anyone else. The gang that robbed you on a Tuesday would be eaten by cannibals on Thursday and so on and so on. That changed though when Granger and her crew started to make waves. They came up from the south and started making it real clear that they planned on making a new home of the Maw. It wasn't the first pirate crew who'd done so, and we didn't take it seriously enough. She'd probably have kicked our asses anyway, but she had help;"

  nf_pmr.2.t:0 "Granger's Law"
  nf_pmr.2.d:0 "After Granger sailed in and knocked our heads together, she didn't waste much time. Just about anyone who wasn't raider material was taken as a slave and put to work on various projects to outfit her crew for the next conquest. And she was smart, I'll give her that. She did something no one else really had; she picked sides. The Rillbugs blew up the Cross Crew, the Clam Sons hunted down the last of the Broadsiders, Tilla's Pride sank to the bottom of the sea while Tom Toms laughed it up on the radio with his boys; all with the blessing and help of Granger Storm the new Queen of Port Maw. Wasn't long before she had an army of raider gangs all following her lead. \n\nShe kept up with her kingmaker game as she went along the coast, and soon her armies and fleets were scooping up all the little independent towns around. Tillamook, Longview, Beaverton, and even chunks of Portland were all soon flying her flag, and the regular folks all ended up in chains. Wasn't long before even some of the cannibals to the south were playing nice and not trying to take too many nibbles out of her merchandise. Only the bigger maneater clans to the south and the black armored ghosts of Washington gave her pause. While her soldiers got to rest, we weren't given the same opportunity. I remember them making us build"

  nf_pmr.3.d:0 "Granger and the other bosses settled in once they ran out of easy targets, spending their days bickering about how to divvy up the spoils between each other and not much else. It's like they've just been riding that victory high for a while, maybe literally considering all the chems they're blowing through. That hasn't stopped the slavers from sending out raiding parties to nab folks like you or cracking the whip though. They've had us working our asses off nonstop when they're not looking to sell us off to folks like the Washington ghosts or worse, the cannibals. As bad as things are though, it seems like things might be looking up, at least a little. \n\nCome in closer, I don't want anyone else to hear. Word is someone's been trying to help us, bumpin' off slavers and screwing with their stuff. The other slaves are calling them The Free Spirit, saying they're some kind of hero trying to free us all. I don't really know how true it all is but stories about them have been on everyone's lips for the last couple months. A friend told me that their brother saw the Spirit punch a slaver's head clean off before tossing a grenade into one of their booze halls. I even overheard one of the guards saying that"

  nf_pmr_april.1.d:0 "Our story starts on a small group of islands out in what we now know as the "Pacific Ocean", since time immemorial us pirates have raided, swashbuckled, and and stole all across the one sea! (That we knew about, anyway.) \n\n We did what we want, took what we wanted, and lived how we pleased, and it was good! \n\n Until Donkey Kong and his meddling crew of mediocre monkeys started messing with us! Him and his lousy bunch harassed our ships, stole our loot, and booby-trapped our booty! \n\n He's been a pain in our butt forever now, and we were just about to stop him, with a plan to.."

They seemed relatively uninterested in us or the DK crew at first, but it quickly became clear that they saw us as irradiated mutants in need of study. They ran a vicious campaign of capturing our entire crew, and the monkeys too! \n\n The experiments they ran on us for months after will haunt us eternally, we didn't even get a lollipop at the end like a normal doctor's visit. That time taught us an important lesson..."

The look on their faces when we sailed straight through the doors on the harbour were priceless! We were home free, and set sail east, in the same direction the Americans had come from. We couldn't save our island from them, but maybe we could get a little payback in turn! There was loads of booty on the ship aswell, including...."

They'd also escaped the islands from the Enclave and sailed East, and were posted up on an island just off the coast! \n\nIn a stunning display of tact, King K. Rool planned an expert heist on their banana vault! \n\n First we attacked at night, stuffing Donkey Kong into a barrel and rolling him down a hill, then we broke into the vault with a comically large stick of dynamite, then we packed all the bananas we could onto our ship and sailed south, finding a new home...here. In "Port Maw.""
