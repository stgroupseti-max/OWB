Their military leader hasn't been seen for a while, so we can presume Shale finally bite the dust. For a long time now, we nursed good relations with our sister city in the neighbourhood, and right now, the Stockton super mutants are under our jurisdiction as well - [ROOT.GetLeader] believes it's high time to make the situation official.\n\nThis land is for everybody, human, ghoul or supermutant alike, as this is a land of freedom, and it was built upon the cooperation of the independent towns, one way or another.

  form_motor_city_desc:0 "Ever since the NCR marched into the Mojave and Mr House's robots arose from their slumber, we've been forced to take refuge in Vault 3 and run our drug empire while avoiding Ranger patrols. Not only does this stifle our trade, but it also prevents us for embracing the motor as an efficient, reliable method of drug delivery. Should we conquer New Vegas and fend off the Californian menace, we'd have both reliable access to pre-war motor technology and a blooming market to trade to. Vegas would become our Motor City: the centre of our great drug empire."

Luck, an infinite amount of luck. "Let's beat the Legion", he said, sounding like a lunatic. "Let's take the city at the end of the Hook and settle here", he said, readying his band of raiders for a suicide mission. He sounded like a madman when he took charge the first time, but Kyle the Hook always ends up triumphant. Somehow."
