  KAM_RANGER_KENNETH_DESC:0 "Once a beloved father of five and Pioneer Scout Troop Leader extraordinaire, Ranger Kenneth was in the middle of a troop hike when the bombs went off. Distraught and broken, he retreated into the radioactive winter pines, losing himself before finding others like himself in the wild: lost and broken men, equally disenfranchised. It wasn’t long before he gathered a larger group, and as supplies grew scarce, and his mind snapped piece-by-piece, he grew more and more violent. \n\nHis people, the Kamlo Survivalists as the Whistler Nomads referred to them, consisted of outcasts, survivors, and other park personnel. Really, Kenneth was looking for anyone who’d listen to him and his delusions as he sank deeper and deeper into lulls of mania. Eventually, he made a friend in the ghoulified monkey, Jorge. The two became inseparable shortly after, with Kenneth sometimes using Jorge as a confidante for his more sentimental thoughts of yor... Or to reinforce his own beliefs."
