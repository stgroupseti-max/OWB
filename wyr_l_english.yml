  ## Baron's Foci
  WYR_birth_of_a_baron_key:0 "Birth Of A Baron"
  WYR_birth_of_a_baron_desc_key:0 "Every great land needs an equally great founding father. The founder of the Eyrie is a humble and bold man named Augustus. This is how his story began."
  WYR_zack_arrives_key:0 "Zack Arrives"
  WYR_zack_arrives_desc_key:0 "Travellers from the west, exhausted and hungry, came to the Eyrie and then to Augustus' door. They were exiled warriors in search of a home, and they found themselves more than welcome."
  WYR_blotting_out_the_sun_key:0 "Blotting Out The Sun"
  WYR_blotting_out_the_sun_desc_key:0 "Raiders and tribal squatters alike became rarities within the Eyrie over time, thanks to the Baron and Zack Company. The work of such brave men is never truly finished however and yet more tribes chose to encroach upon our lands."
  WYR_zack_company_reforms:0 "Zack Company Reforms"
  WYR_zack_company_reforms_desc:0 "“Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, without your efforts the Eyrie would still be a lawless country. And yet it was my father who claimed the lion's share of the credit. It is time for that to change. A time for a renewed Zack Company, one that will be recognized as heroes and the personal hand of a Baroness. A toast to you!” - Annette Bailey"
  WYR_a_preemptive_strike:0 "A Rallying Cry"
  WYR_a_preemptive_strike_desc:0 "“Wild folks like the Khans aren’t peaceful neighbours, my friends. See how they plant no seeds, raise no livestock? When they get hungry they’ll come knocking on our doors, looking to raid our larders and drag off anything they can carry. I say we don’t give them the chance, and we all must stand together on this.” - Augustus Bailey"
  WYR_slash_and_burn:0 "Slash And Burn"
  WYR_slash_and_burn_desc:0 "“These Khans are putting up a fiercer fight than any of us expected. I say we've been too kind to them. Raid their stores, burn their homes and poison their wells. That will break some spirits.” - Annette Bailey"
  WYR_a_civilized_victory:0 "A Civilized Victory"
  WYR_a_civilized_victory_desc:0 "“A tribe of raiders was never going to be able to match up against the spirit of honest, hard working folks like ourselves. The Khans are defeated, and the land stands ready for us to put it to work. Praise be to God, and to your Baron!” - Augustus Bailey"
  WYR_sweeping_up_the_mess:0 "Sweeping Up The Mess"
  WYR_sweeping_up_the_mess_desc:0 "The war is over but the work is not. There are roads to clear, fences to mend, bridges to build and fields to sow. The Weber's cannot do it all alone, take up your spades."
  WYR_access_to_mountain_waters:0 "Under a Firm Boot"
  WYR_access_to_mountain_waters_desc:0 "With the Khans put down, the next step for our new pastures and farmland is to put them to work. Idle hands are the devil’s playground after all, and we have no need for more devils."
  WYR_what_was_theirs_is_ours:0 "What Was Theirs Is Ours"
  WYR_what_was_theirs_is_ours_desc:0 "The Khans weren't exactly wealthy, truth be told, but there are spoils to be divided up nonetheless. Guns, chems, land and of course workers are all up for grabs, though the bulk of it will go to the Bailey's and Hartfords of course. They suffered the most from the fighting after all and deserve compensation."
  WYR_a_chip:0 "A Chip"
  WYR_a_chip_desc:0 "A scheme is being hatched at the Bailey estate, and not for the first time, by the Baron's beloved daughter."
  WYR_reward_the_families:0 "Reward The Families"
  WYR_reward_the_families_desc:0 "“I'm lucky to have been blessed with neighbours as good as y'all in a land beset on all sides by the lawless and the faithless. I could not have done it without your help friends, though it's best we all remember where you'd be without the old Baron. Take these gifts home with you, and think of me fondly.” - Augustus Bailey"
  WYR_restrain_the_families:0 "Restrain The Families"
  WYR_restrain_the_families_desc:0 "“Don't trouble yourselves neighbours, business will continue much as it did under my beloved father. We'll all grow quite wealthy and bring this wild land to heel. A reminder to you all however: I know everything that happens in the Eyrie. Especially the things that no one is supposed to know. Have a good evening.” - Annette Bailey"
  WYR_repaying_a_debt:0 "Repaying A Debt"
  WYR_repaying_a_debt_desc:0 "“Wake up Ezekiel. We need to talk.” - Augustus Bailey"
  WYR_the_gentle_agency:0 "The Gentle Agency"
  WYR_the_gentle_agency_desc:0 "“Father lacked subtlety and it eventually proved to be his undoing. I don't intend to follow in such clumsy footsteps. That is why you're here, the first like-minded employees of a new bureau that will ensure the safety and prosperity of the Eyrie and the Baileys. The world will keep no secrets from you.” - Annette Bailey"
  WYR_not_in_my_backyard:0 "Not In My Backyard"
  WYR_not_in_my_backyard_desc:0 "The lands to the south have dissolved into complete chaos in recent times. Monsters and ruffians at every turn and innocent ranchers and settlers caught in between. It is our responsibility to restore order and civilization, whether they wish it or not."
  WYR_the_land_development_decree:0 "The Land Development Decree"
  WYR_the_land_development_decree_desc:0 "Too many fields lay fallow and overgrown from months or even years of conflict. The roads between them are in even worse shape. Cornelius Weber has come to us with an ambitious plan to restore the land and only asks for every worker and coin that can be spared in exchange."
  WYR_the_river_watch:0 "The River Watch"
  WYR_the_river_watch_desc:0 "With greater access to the rivers has come great wealth, especially for the Saunders and their burgeoning trade network. With that wealth comes new threats however, of pirates and others with ill intent. Marietta Saunders has offered to front the initial costs of developing a force to patrol and guard the shores and trade ships. So be it."
  WYR_eyes_on_the_south:0 "Eyes On The South"
  WYR_eyes_on_the_south_desc:0 "We have exchanged one dangerous border for another. This time perhaps it is better to build higher fences and watchtowers rather than moving to another war. Mountains and canyons don't exactly provide much for agriculture anyway."
  WYR_battle_bighorners:0 "Battle Bighorners"
  WYR_battle_bighorners_desc:0 "Sheila Hartford has presented a novel idea based on her newest experiments: selectively raising Bighorners for aggression and training them for use in battle. It's a risk to be sure, and may not even work, but her confidence is infectious. Surely we can give her our blessings to try?"
  WYR_bighorner_unlock_tt:0 "We will unlock §YBighorners§! as a fieldable division type.\nAdditionally, our superior fields and rearing methods mean that they'll be §G10%§! superior to a standard Bighorner in almost every way. And §G15%§! cheaper to breed to boot."
  WYR_a_spark_to_a_flame:0 "A Spark To A Flame"
  WYR_a_spark_to_a_flame_desc:0 "The 'individualists' to our East have proved time and time again to be little better than raiders. The latest farm to end up sacked is the last straw. They can no longer hide behind claims of attacks being from isolated clans acting without permission. If it's truly so anarchic there, we will bring order by force."
  WYR_clearing_out_ruffians:0 "Clearing Out Ruffians"
  WYR_clearing_out_ruffians_desc:0 "Whether they're the Jacksons, Ruminators or worse, we can see quite clearly that all our efforts have only won us more bad neighbours. Outlaws and tribes will find that we're more than capable of bringing them to heel."
  WYR_a_new_nation_is_born:0 "A New Nation Is Born"
  WYR_a_new_nation_is_born_desc:0 "We have outgrown the Eyrie, becoming something much more. Settlers flock to our towns and the families have grown truly wealthy while our military has become one to be feared. It is time to celebrate the birth of something new."
  WYR_they_ride_for_us:0 "They Ride For Us"
  WYR_they_ride_for_us_desc:0 "The east ever remains threatening, with the thunder of hooves and war drums echoing across the wide open plains. Should such a cacophony come for us, we must be prepared to defend what is ours."
  WYR_fill_the_coffers:0 "Fill The Coffers"
  WYR_fill_the_coffers_desc:0 "“Never in my wildest dreams did I believe that I'd be just this successful, that so much of the land would bend to my will. This is the beginning of a golden age, one of wealth and peace. Fortify the borders, raise the taxes, and dash it all, tell Annette she can come back home!” - Augustus Bailey"
  WYR_in_search_of_a_back_to_stab:0 "In Search Of A Back To Stab"
  WYR_in_search_of_a_back_to_stab_desc:0 "“I've done well, yes. More and more taxes flow into the coffers and everyone who's anyone around here is in my pocket. It doesn't feel like I'm done however, not when there's always more enemies to be found and destroyed. Clean your rifles and keep your boots polished, we must be ready to strike at a moment's notice.” - Annette Bailey"
  WYR_birth_of_a_baron:0 "Birth Of A Baron"
  WYR_birth_of_a_baron_desc:0 "Every great land needs an equally great founding father. The founder of the Eyrie is a humble and bold man named Augustus. This is how his story began."
  WYR_zack_arrives:0 "Zack Arrives"
  WYR_zack_arrives_desc:0 "Travellers from the west, exhausted and hungry, came to the Eyrie and then to Augustus' door. They were exiled warriors in search of a home, and they found themselves more than welcome."
  WYR_blotting_out_the_sun:0 "Blotting Out The Sun"
  WYR_blotting_out_the_sun_desc:0 "Raiders and tribal squatters alike became rarities within the Eyrie over time, thanks to the Baron and Zack Company. The work of such brave men is never truly finished however and yet more tribes chose to encroach upon our lands."
  WYR_stmatthewsdue:0 "St. Matthew's Due"
  WYR_stmatthewsdue_desc:0 "“Loyalty must be rewarded, and no one has been so loyal to me as Father Axton and St. Matthew. Not even my own blood has such a distinction. It will be fitting to reward such fealty with the building of a new home for the flock. They can always pay me back eventually after all, for what are tithes but taxes?” - Augustus Bailey"
  WYR_boot_grows:0 "The Boot Grows Heavier"
  WYR_boot_grows_desc:0 "It’s not been an easy task to tame this land, but our expansion into the north has borne greater and greater fruit. The Khans rebellious spirit has largely been crushed, and the herds grow fat and plentiful. This land is truly ours now."
  WYR_wild_hounds:0 "The Wild Hounds"
  WYR_wild_hounds_desc:0 "Unexpected but not unwelcome, some of our people stumbled on the ruins of a former kennel and dog training school in the northern reaches of the former Khan territories. There’s dozens of hounds in the area, strong and fit, and Sheila is certain that she can refine their breeding stock if we can capture the packs. Efforts should begin immediately. What’s a rancher without a faithful hound to keep them company after all?"
  WYR_distribute_manuals:0 "Distribute Training Manuals"
  WYR_distribute_manuals_desc:0 "“Sheila and Clarence have been hard at work putting together a mess of books for our soldiers. It’s impressive work, and getting out copies to General Scott and the rest should do a lot for morale and discipline. It had better, considering how much all the paper cost.” - Augustus Bailey"
  WYR_free_up_hands:0 "Free Up Some Hands"
  WYR_free_up_hands_desc:0 "“Sheila, bless her, has been hard at work developing some new breeds of tato and mutfruit that are tough, quick to grow and tasty to boot. Growing and caring for them doesn’t take nearly as many farm hands as the older kinds. We won’t let those folks go unemployed though, there’s no doubt we can find new jobs for them elsewhere. Jobs with guns in hand and ready to keep us all safe. - Augustus Bailey"
  WYR_eyrie_aerie:0 "The Eyrie’s Aerie"
  WYR_eyrie_aerie_desc:0 "“The Hartfords oldest boy, James, came by with a proposal. He wants me to invest in setting up a proper airfield for him and his crew to work out of. I don’t hold much with flying machines, prefer my boots firmly on the ground, but the boy was very insistent that it’s the next step towards civilizing this land. He also promised to take me up flying someday but I think I’ll offer up Annette to go instead.” - Augustus Bailey"
  WYR_pious_sister:0 "The Pious Sister"
  WYR_pious_sister_desc:0 "“In times like these, you ought to put whatever you’ve got to work and that includes your family. Evelyn may be a bit useless, but Muriel on the other hand? She knows almost anyone who matters in the Eyrie, and could get folks riled up and ready for the next struggle. If I want her to listen though, I’ll need to make a big show on the Church’s behalf. Woman is so godly sometimes I think she believes harder than the Father!” - Augustus Bailey"
  WYR_expand_caravanserai:0 "Expand the Caravanserai"
  WYR_expand_caravanserai_desc:0 "As we expand our operations and holdings throughout the region, more and more trade is forced to cross our borders. Should we direct such traffic towards Caspar and expand the markets and amenities available to caravans it will encourage merchants to invest more themselves. More money for us and more comfortable travel for them is a win-win."
  WYR_weber_workshops:0 "Weber Workshops"
  WYR_weber_workshops_desc:0 "“Old Cornelius offered to buy out one of my smaller ranches to expand his workshops into. As long as he keeps his ‘workers’ out of my sight, I suppose it’s for the best. We always need more weapons and equipment after all.” - Annette Bailey"
  WYR_job_for_gentle:0 "A Job for the Gentle"
  WYR_job_for_gentle_desc:0 "“The Webers have expanded, but have reported a worker shortage. They’re going missing in increasing numbers, and I’ve already had Savannah check their books to make sure it’s not a trick. She suspects we’ve got a soft heart or two responsible for the bleeding so I think it’s time I let her loose to find them.” - Annette Bailey"
  WYR_iris_of_the_water:0 "Iris of the Water"
  WYR_iris_of_the_water_desc:0 "“I met with Iris for coffee and cakes today, all things she brought from a long distance trade voyage. The coffee was oddly spicy but very good. During our conversation Iris brought up just how few boats we have at our disposal, and how simple most of them are. It’s inspired me to put a greater investment into the fleet, to keep pirates away from our shores if nothing else.” - Annette Bailey"
  WYR_encourage_grady_promotion:0 "Encourage Grady’s Promotion"
  WYR_encourage_grady_promotion_desc:0 "“Zack Company has shaped up significantly in recent days, watching them drill has become quite the pleasant pastime on lazy days. They’re missing something though. An underhanded edge, something that makes proper use of our intelligence and subtlety. I’ve spoken with Grady several times and he agrees. I should encourage Scott to give him wider authority.” - Annette Bailey"
  WYR_anarchy_no_longer:0 "Anarchy Reigns No Longer"
  WYR_anarchy_no_longer_desc:0 "“I’ve never really understood how those Marshall folks do things, but it’s clear enough they aren’t used to having a firm hand on the tiller. Things will have to change, sooner rather than later, if we don’t want them trying to revolt every other day. Spread around some caps, some pardons for banditry, and shoot a couple of the louder malcontents and that should get the ball rolling.” Augustus Bailey"
  WYR_playing_fools:0 "Playing the Fools"
  WYR_playing_fools_desc:0 "“The idiots of Marshall aren’t adjusting well to actually having leadership or real laws to follow. The last thing I want is an open revolt, so it’s time to nip this in the bud. Offer deals to some of their more cooperative clans and start them fighting amongst themselves. We play favorites for a while and shoot enough of the troublemakers, should end up on top with enough of them loyal to us to keep the rest in line.” - Annette Bailey"


  ## Characters
  WYR_brahmin_baron_name:0 "Augustus Bailey"
  WYR_brahmin_baron_desc:0 "Ruthless pragmatism is the name of the game for Baron Bailey, the self-styled tycoon who controls his land with an iron fist. Presenting himself as a soft-spoken rural statesman, in his bowler hats and fine vests, he can be quite charming as long as it suits him. He can only be trusted in word or deed as far as it benefits him however. There is little he won't stoop to in pursuit of wealth and power as long as his own neck isn't put on the line, with mercenaries, surprise attacks, deals with those even less reputable than himself and a cruel cunning all having played their part in getting him this far, but like any man of his breed it isn't enough to satisfy."
  WYR_barons_daughter_name:0 "Annette Bailey"
  WYR_brahmin_daughter_desc:0 "The Baron is dead, long live the Baroness.\n\nAfter waiting for far too long, Annette finally has what she wanted: full control. She has only minor plans to change the day to day business of the Eyrie. The most important change has already taken place after all. Tempting as it is, Annette cannot simply rest on her laurels and enjoy the sound of taxes coming in though. There are threats and challenges and above all opportunities in all directions and she'll need to keep playing the game wisely to stay on top. Her gifts for subterfuge, ruthless nature and silver tongue will continue to serve her well."
  WYR_barons_daughter_economic_desc:0 "“When the world is this dark can you really go wrong stabbing at the shadows?”\n\nFor every child that rejects their parents way of life, another is a chip off of the proverbial block. Annette is one such daughter, taking after her father in most things. This is both a point of pride and cause for constant concern as far as the Baron is concerned. She is as grasping, conniving, ambitious and self-centered as he is, and that makes her quite dangerous to keep around as one's lieutenant. He suspects that more than once she has tried to kill him, and aside from that her verbal barbs and criticisms are sharp enough to cut.\n\nBut even Augustus has a soft spot for his daughter, unwilling to do more than scold and occasionally place her under house arrest. Her talents are also considerable, as she's an expert in glad-handing and convincing others to do as the Bailey's wish. Better to have her out sipping tea and shaking hands than stewing and plotting at home after all."
  WYR_clarence_name:0 "Clarence Hartford"
  WYR_clarence_army_chief_desc:0 "“War just seems to follow me around.”\n\nFollowing stoic and quiet in his wife's footsteps, Clarence has also come to the Eyrie in search of a new life. Where Sheila ingratiated herself to the neighbors quickly, her husband took considerably longer to warm up to them. It was the Baron's enforcer Ezekiel, offering aid in hunting a rogue deathclaw roving through the area, who eventually got close to the tight-lipped man. Bonding through silence and hunting, Clarence revealed to his new friend that he was an experienced soldier, a veteran of many battles in land to the east. He was tired of the warrior's life, but he was easily one the most experienced killers in the Eyrie. Ezekiel spoke to him of how Zack Company and especially the rest of the Baron's men lacked in discipline and organization, and Clarence has been convinced to aid in training them back up to snuff."
  WYR_sheila_name:0 "Sheila Hartford"
  WYR_sheila_theorist_desc:0 "“I’d rather be gardening than fostering another crop of soldiers but the Hartford luck never was strong.”\n\nMrs. Hartford is a recent arrival in the Eyrie, having come from the east before making her new home just down the road from the Bailey Estate. In the days after, over coffee and mutfruit tarts, Sheila and Annette Bailey became fast friends, with the latter woman introducing the other to her father. The Baron was happy enough to learn his new neighbors were respectable folk, but even happier to hear that Sheila was a scientist. Sheila showed the Baileys her library of preserved books and holotapes, saying they'd been reclaimed from 'folks who didn't appreciate them enough'. Agriculture, animal husbandry, human genetics and more all fell within her areas of study, and she felt the Eyrie was an ideal place to quietly continue her research.\n\nAs her work continued to benefit the bottom line of the Eyrie and its various farms and ranches, the Baileys continued to act as patrons for Sheila and eventually placed her and her family in positions of great power. She is responsible for far more than just home experiments now, but for her part, she's just happy to be dealing with one or two swollen egos than an entire military hierarchy full of them."
  WYR_cornelius_name:0 "Cornelius Weber"
  WYR_cornelius_economic_advisor_desc:0 "“Another road here, another workshop there, two more wells over this way, might be able to get this power plant back online...”\n\nThe land exists to be worked, and its people to be orderly and productive. This is the philosophy of those who lord over the Eyrie, and it is men like Cornelius Weber that facilitate such work. Cornelius is a mousy, elderly man with a voice like rain who wouldn't harm a fly but knows just how to build a hundred roads for soldiers to march down and workshops to arm them. He is also the patriarch of the Weber family, one of the most powerful in the Eyrie, and wields a considerable amount of influence in turn. His kin are known for their gifts with engineering and making use of old technology and techniques. And so it is his task to lead teams of workers, both paid and otherwise, to repair and connect the old infrastructure of the old days and work to produce the guns and other tools his employer requires."
  WYR_marietta_name:0 "Marietta Saunders"
  WYR_marietta_economic_advisor_desc:0 "“What’s a people without trade? Not much dear.”\n\nThere's an adage amongst the common folk of the Eyrie: 'Noone greedier than a Bailey, unless it's a Saunders'. It's true enough, though few would be stupid enough to say it where a member of that powerful family could overhear them. Marietta is the matriarch of the family, and well respected by the rest of her clan for both her keen head with numbers and accounting as well as her venison stew. Trade negotiation is her favorite pastime however, and the lion's share of the Saunders family's wealth brought in over the last ten years was made on Marietta's porch as she smoked her pipe and cut deals. Privately, she still mourns her husband and is bound and determined to provide the easiest possible life for her brood."
  WYR_axton_name:0 "Father Axton"
  WYR_axton_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "“Saint Matthew blesses us each day, and those blessings must be rendered to the service of the greater good.”\n\nFather James Axton kept the candles burning and the faith alive at the small All-Saints Chapel for many decades before a young Augustus Bailey came to him. That marked the beginning of a change in both men. The Father instilled a healthy fear of God and a sense of responsibility to make the world a better place into the young man. In turn, the future Baron pushed Axton to harden his heart against the faithless and to instill within his flock the importance of tithe and tax. The Father now believes strongly in the Baron and his family, seeing them as a beacon of faith and order against a dark world and at their urging has pushed the chapel towards the veneration of St. Matthew in particular. He looks the other way as the Bailey's repeatedly dip their hands in the donation box and instead delivers more and more sermons denouncing the Eyrie's many godless neighbors and calling for action against them."
  WYR_savannah_name:0 "Savannah Childs"
  WYR_savannah_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "“The best small folk keep to their place, and the rest have a habit of disappearing. Be your best.”\n\nSavannah is a childhood friend of Annette's, with the two having bonded over games of Hide and Seek and endless youthful plots. As they reached adulthood, they only became closer, with both knowing secrets about the other that could destroy their reputations but keeping tight-lipped. Now they remain best friends and with Annette's rise in power came an opportunity for Savannah to rise as well. She is a snoop, nosey to a fault, and has few qualms about who gets hurt as long as she and 'Annie' come out on top. Acting as head of the Baroness' new secret police is a role that she has slipped into with great ease and pleasure. Even the rest of the Childs family is not necessarily safe."
  WYR_scott_name:0 "General Scott"
  WYR_scott_high_command_desc:0 "“We’ll not be shamed again, not if I have anything to say about it.”\n\nThe eldest and highest ranking of Zack Company remaining, General Edward Scott has seen his fair share of battles both glorious and ignonimous. He tries to focus on the glorious, but there is a deep core of bitterness that gnaws at the General's heart that grows with each setback and year. He is at different times either harsh or very lenient on his men, depending on how their last mission went, and whispers amongst the rest of the militia center around his growing dependence on drink. Despite these many issues, he is still a man well versed in the art of warfare and hardened against the grim realities that come with it. The Bailey's place a considerable amount of trust in him, and for now that respect and trust is enough to give him purpose. He is happiest when leading his boys to clear out raiders and tribal camps."
  WYR_harold_grady_name:0 "Major Harold Grady"
  WYR_harold_grady_theorist_desc:0 "“If some junkie raiders can fight at night and set booby traps under every nuka-cola bottle, so can we.”\n\nThere are some within Zack Company who hold the disorganized and unorthodox battle tactics of raiders and some tribals in contempt, either out of a sense of elitism or having been on the receiving end of it too many times. Major Harold Grady on the other hand feels quite differently. Grady holds that such methods of waging war are more effective than they appear, and has a history of training the men beneath him in similar methods. Traps, ambushes, night attacks, and other partisan tactics all lie within his wheelhouse, and given the chance he’d extend such training to the rest of the Eyries soldiers, tax collectors and assorted fighters."
  WYR_james_hartford_name:0 "James Hartford"
  WYR_james_hartford_air_chief_desc:0 "“Well it’s no vertibird, but I’m sure I can get this old buzzard back in the skies.”\n\nThe eldest son of the Hartford family, James eschews his mothers scientific interest and fathers soldierly stoicism in favor of engineering. Specifically flight engineering. While flying machines of any variety are difficult to find on the Eyrie, James is an expert at maintaining and restoring any he can get his hands on. The young man chafes at times under the command of the Baileys and their rural regime, being more accustomed to military hierarchies, but as long as they fund his projects he’ll follow his parents lead."
  WYR_muriel_name:0 "Muriel Bailey-Weber"
  WYR_muriel_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "“Darlings, the peace of the Eyrie is a god given gift. We’d be ungrateful if we didn’t try and share it with our neighbours.”\n\nSister to Augustus and a prominent member of the Weber family through marriage, Muriel holds no small amount of influence within the Eyrie. That influence however lies less with her ties to powerful clans and more with her deep involvement in the Church of St. Matthew. She is a deeply pious woman and spends much of her free time organizing outreach and recruitment programs for Father Axton and the rest of the church. While the politics of the Eyrie are beneath her, should her brother ask nicely and humbly enough she’s willing to lend a hand to his wider plans. Pies will be baked, rallies will be held, and the citizens of the Eyrie will be roused to the support of their church and the Baileys as well."
  WYR_iris_saunders_name:0 "Iris Saunders"
  WYR_iris_saunders_navy_chief_desc:0 "“Get your boots on boys and girls, we’ve got to be in Campment Bay by tomorrow evening.”\n\nA hands-on kind of woman, Iris is often away from the Eyrie working on trade deals up and down the river. An experienced captain who’s built a reputation for navigating the river quicker than anyone else, she’s made the Saunders family no small amount of their fortune. As the Baileys and their allies find themselves embroiled in more and more conflicts the Saunders merchant fleet is pressed into combat service more and more often; Iris included. Luckily for her, speed and flexibility is just as useful in war as it is in business."

  ## Ideas
  wyr_economical:0 "Baron's Way"
  wyr_economical_desc:0 "The Baron is a cruel man, known for his ruthless efficiency. Much of the land in Wyoming is owned and sharecropped out to unknowing hopefuls, who are then trapped in the unfortunate and hellish loop that is the Baron's Eyrie."
  wyr_elite_mercenaries:0 "The Baron's Elite"
  wyr_elite_mercenaries_desc:0 "The mercenaries employed by the baron are the best of the best, and fit his ruthless expansionist mantra of "bigger is better" to a high degree. After many years of service, they've become deathly loyal to him-- and will fight to the death for a slice of their pay."
  wyr_marshall_defense:0 "The Upper Hand"
  wyr_marshall_defense_desc:0 "Those 'free' folks of the Marshall Republic have clashed with us more than once and the last time it went very badly for them. As far as we're concerned those ruffians owe us for our mercy. Reparations are a gentlemanly arrangement, but odds are they'll be back. What they likely don't know is that Annette and others have scouted out everything they're capable of and prepared accordingly. Next time will go even worse for them."
  wyr_khans_war:0 "Desperate Measures"
  wyr_khans_war_desc:0 "With victory not coming as quickly as we'd hoped, it is time to discard any notions of fighting fairly against such savage folk. Every dirty tactic or trick must be utilized to protect our homes and restore peace, no matter what the cost to the land or the people. God will provide."
  wyr_khans_war_victory:0 "Cleanly Victorious"

  nf_baron.1.t:0 "Birth of a Baron"
  nf_baron.1.d:0 "When the sky fell and the world shattered under the impact, all the lands fell into barbarism and chaos. The land now known as the Eyrie was no different, scarred and haunted by monsters, radiation and bands of roving raiders. Not all was hopeless however, and there were always those who stood against the dark. Settlers, ranchers and hunters all banded together for survival in these times. Over the many decades those communities grew and began to turn the tide against chaos. It was the ranching families who became the most influential and powerful in these days, with the foremost of those eventually being the Baileys.\n\nThe Baileys, along with families like the Webers and Saunders, were able to secure significant stretches of land and worked together to protect each other and their workers. The last patriarch of the Bailey clan, Preston, in particular forged agreements between them all in service of mutual protection and enrichment. Preston Bailey had two daughters and a son with his wife. The daughters, Evelyn and Muriel, were soon married to various neighbors while the son became the object of the man's doting love. He was named Augustus, and when they came of age the young man was noted for his:"

  nf_baron.2.d:0 "The son soon succeeded the father, when Preston Bailey found himself killed at the hands of a raider clan known as the Rambreakers. This death was not to be quickly forgotten by the new head of the Bailey family, and it led the new patriarch to increasingly violent skirmishes against the various tribes and raiders that his lands encroached upon. In between battles and running the family's ranches, Augustus did find time in his life to marry Carolyn Saunders and start a family with her. After a brief year together the two welcomed a child into the world, Annette. The birth of his daughter was a bright spot in an otherwise terrible time in Augustus' life, as shortly after he lost his wife to an outbreak of influenza that ripped through the eyrie.\n\nThings began to look up when newcomers arrived in the Eyrie. A militia, exiled from their homes to the west by rivals in the mountains, was traveling aimlessly in search of a new home. A chance encounter between the leader of this Zack Company, General Scott, and Augustus led to the two forging a new alliance that would change the Eyrie's fortune in the days to come. The two shared a hatred for raiders, tribals and other groups that threatened their vision of civilization. They would soon begin enacting plans to wipe out such peoples from the Eyrie and the most important tools Zack Company brought to bear were their:"

  nf_baron.3.d:0 "In the years after Zack Company's arrival, many changes came to the Eyrie. A number of tribes and raider clans were wiped out, starting with the Rambreakers. With those victories came an expansion of the ranches and families, and safer settlements for trade. Augustus ended up receiving the lion's share of the credit for these boons and soon named himself the Baron of the Eyrie. The other families groused in private but none of them could argue when the man controlled the largest militia and their own coffers swelled. His daughter came of age, and she started a close friendship with a hunter named Ezekiel. Not long after Augustus crowned himself, the first of the tax collectors began circulating through the land.\n\nWhile there were those who were less than pleased, their attentions were soon turned towards more foes. Not only by the families, who wished to redirect any rancor from themselves, but also by the Church of St. Matthew that had aligned itself closely to the Bailey family over the years. There was always another group of raiders, or nomadic tribe that was a threat to the people and the land. The most recent target of this violence was the Sungazer tribe, who was roaming in the lands north of the Weber Clan's ranches. They had stepped a little too close to the Bighorner herds and ignored one too many warnings and so they had to go. \n\nZack Company and the rest of the Eyrie's forces moved in, and without hesitation or mercy the Sungazer tribe was wiped out. Once they were destroyed, their hunting grounds were handed over to:"

  nf_baron.4.d:0 "Two men sat silently in the Bailey estates study, nursing their beers and looking into the fire. On the left was the Baron himself, a thick scowl on his face as he considered what to say. On the right sat Ezekiel, the Baron's friend and lieutenant, his expression stoic and inscrutable. When the silence became unbearable, Augustus stood up and tossed another log into the fireplace. “Damnit all 'zeke, you know what kind of position you've put me in?” He turned away to look back into the flames before the other man could reply.\n\nEzekiel finished his beer before answering, his one eye burning a hole in the Baron's back, “I reckon you put me in this position first 'gustus. This Khan stuff is just them gazers all over again. Killin' them was like shootin' fawns. Why are we killin' all these folks?” \n\nThe Baron looked down at his pocket watch idly before speaking “You know the answer to that. They're in the way.” Now Augustus did turn to face his stern faced friend. “Squatting their tents down on perfectly good pastures, planning to rob us the second they run out of roach and stag meat. They're godless savages, no different from any other clan of raiding filth.”\n\nEzekiel shook his head sadly “It doesn't have to be that way. I've watched 'em, they seem reasonable enough.”\n\n“Enough,” The Baron held up his hand. “I can't have folks questioning me in public, undermining me. Not even you 'zeke.”\n\nStanding up and putting on his hat, Ezekiel looked into Augustus' face and said simply “Guess ya'll gonna have to lock me up then.”"

  nf_baron.5.t:0 "Off the Old Block"
  nf_baron.5.d:0 "The Baron's daughter Annette takes after her father in many ways. She is ambitious, ruthless, grasping and selfish, with a mind full of plans and schemes. Whispers around the estate claim that extends even to her own family, with many suspecting that the prodigal daughter has attempted to kill her father more than once. For his own part Augustus dotes upon his daughter, and while he is aware of her ambitious nature it mostly is a source of pride for the man. Not that he hasn't had to chastise her a time or two for overreach.\n\nNow Annette has been seen spending several nights away from the estate, not coming home until the sunrise or even until the following evening. Augustus was away hunting during the first of these nights, but he's now home and a few of the servants have warned him that she looks to be up to something. Even one of the Baron's firearms has disappeared from its safe. Annette merely asked her father to trust her when questioned about these events, though she did remark off-handedly about missing Ezekiel. Shall Augustus place his faith in his heir, or send her to work on diplomatic missions far from home where she can still be of use but hard-pressed to work any mischief?"

  nf_baron.6.t:0 "Jailbreak"
  nf_baron.6.d:0 "Annette smirked from the shadows in which she'd waited during the whole affair. The Baron, her father, was dead. Her message to him had been simple: 'Come to the jailhouse, there's a plot I've uncovered.' When he'd arrived he found himself running straight into Ezekiel, newly free from his cell. She'd slipped a key to the imprisoned man in one of her letters to him, along with something else. Her father had sounded so shocked when Ezekiel had drawn a gun, one stolen from the Bailey estate a few nights before, and shot him in response to him brandishing his own weapon. Ezekiel had always been one of the best shots in the Eyrie, and Annette had been counting on him not losing his touch in prison.\n\nShe stepped out silently, and said to Ezekiel's back as he stood over the body of his former friend “Well done love.”\n\nHe whirled about, gun raised before realizing who'd spoken. His shoulders slumped then, and in a low voice he said “Don't call me that Annie. Not now.” He looked back at the body again before asking “This is what ya'll actually wanted isn't it?”\n\nAnnette walked up to him and gave him a kiss on the cheek. “I want a lot of things 'zeke. Tonight I got two of them.” Her voice took on an almost sad note then “I'll give you something now though. A head start.”\n\nEzekiel understood the threat in her words, and knew that she'd have to put a bounty on his head for this. He frowned once more, turned towards the door and ran off into the night. She heard him call out over his shoulder “They ain't made a viper with fangs sharper than you Annie.”"

  nf_baron.7.t:0 "Begging Your Pardon"
  nf_baron.7.d:0 "Ezekiel woke to the sound of Baron Bailey's voice outside his cell, telling him “Wake up Ezekiel. We need to talk.”\n\nWithout removing the hat that he'd placed over his face to block out the light, the imprisoned man replied “I'm hearin' you Augustus. What can I do you for?”\n\nThe sound of a key turning and a cell door being opened was his first answer, and then Ezekiel did sit up and remove his hat to look upon his visitor. Augustus took a seat in the lone chair on the far side of the cell and looked around the room before finally speaking up. “I'm here to let you go.” His face looked like he'd just taken a bite of spoiled cheese.\n\n“Beggin' your pardon?” Ezekiel raised an eyebrow before adding “What made you want to go and do a thing like that?”\n\nThe Baron took a cigarette from his pocket and lit it, passing it to Ezekiel before lighting one for himself. “Clarence. He's been in my ear ever since I had you put away. Now that the Khans have been gone for a spell he's insisting I let you go if I want him to stick around.” He took a long drag, letting the smoke out in a big cloud through his nose. “Truth of the matter is, I didn't like having you in here anyway.”\n\nEzekiel put on his boots and stood up, cigarette burning slowly between his lips. He took a sheaf of letters from the small table and tucked them into his coat before looking long and hard at the Baron “So just like that, I can walk on out the door?”\n\nAugustus nodded and waved towards the exit, choosing to check his pocket watch instead of looking into the other man's eye. “Just like that. Wherever you want to go. Just try not to cause me no more trouble 'zeke.”"

  nf_baron.8.d:0 "Annette looked down at her father's pocket watch, observing the hands ticking along through the cracked glass. It had been quite a while since his passing, and while there was a part of her that surprised her in missing him, she'd long since fully replaced him as far as the Eyrie was concerned. The Baroness was master and everyone either respected or feared her, exactly as she wished. She made her way out onto the porch, poured herself a glass of wine and considered the stars overhead. Why was she so wistful lately, she wondered.\n\nEventually it came to her; she was lonely. Savannah was still her devoted partner in crime, but becoming Baroness had changed how everyone else treated her. Understandably so, considering she'd demanded it of them. Another glass of wine later and her thoughts turned to Ezekiel. He was still out there somewhere, regardless of the bounty on his head. Not that she'd actually wanted anyone to find him and bring him in.\n\nLooking out into the night, she said aloud to herself “Well, if I want him back I can have him back can't I? This is my country.” She went back inside then with the bottle of wine and drafted messages to her agents, instructing them to cancel the bounty and find Ezekiel. She then wrote a letter to be delivered to Ezekiel, as soon as they found him, that would welcome him back. Hopefully right back into her arms."

  nf_baron.9.d:0 "It felt unnatural to her, walking out into the woods alone. She'd left behind her usual guards and Savannah a few miles back and had only her shotgun and the tick of her pocket watch to keep her company. A response from Ezekiel had finally come a few days ago, asking her to come out and meet him alone. It was the only reason she had made the trip and was ignoring the various alarms screaming in her mind about being so exposed. He had more power over her than she'd ever expected.\n\n“Mornin' Annie” she heard a familiar voice suddenly call out from the trees. She resisted the urge to jump and fire her gun with some difficulty before lowering it and putting on her best stoic expression. Ezekiel stepped out where she could see him, looking only a little worse for wear after his months on the run. “I must say, I'm impressed y'all came out here on your own. You actually do trust me don't you?”\n\nAnnette kept her face steady, and walked right up to him. He watched her intently with his good eye but was nonetheless taken aback when she grabbed the bandana around his neck and pulled him in for a kiss. After a long moment, she released him and said “You're a good man 'zeke, one of the few. I can trust in that.” He remained speechless as she continued “Come on back with me cowboy, I've been missing you.” She smiled slyly, “Maybe I'll even let you marry me.”\n\n“You never were shy Annie,” Ezekiel adjusted his coat and smiled back at her. “Well when you put it like that, I say yes.”"

  nf_baron.10.d:0 "Augustus felt good. The new church was as fine as you could ask, with a special pew just for him and his. The father was just finishing up a fiery sermon about the godless and savage ways of the folks down southways, and how the people needed to render unto the Baileys so that such chaos would never come to their homes. Most importantly of all, the collection plate stopped at him last so that he could personally inspect it. Truly, the Baron felt, St. Matthew looked down on him and smiled.\n\nHe lingered after mass, both to congratulate Axton and to ask the Father to share a drink or two that evening, but Augustus’ peace was disturbed. The Hartfords, Sheila and Clarence, made their way to his pew rather than out the door. Sheila sat and paid little attention to the men, typing away on a pip-boy, but Clarence had a hard look in his deep eyes. The Baron frowned and broke the tension by asking “Ezekiel again?”\n\nClarence nodded, and dropped a few more caps into the collection plate sitting nearby before sitting down. “It’s been long enough, he’s one of us. Let him walk Augustus, or maybe we will.”"

What you’re getting yourselves into?” Two of them he didn’t recognize, though they looked ready for a shootout any moment, but the last he did. The woman standing at his back, a rifle at the ready, was Savannah Childs. He’d heard she was one of the new Baroness’ favorites, and had seen her at the church a couple times. \n\n“I know a lot of things boy.” Savannah said, savoring the moment. “I know you’re old Cornelius’ grandson. I know he knows just what you’ve done and just what’s about to happen.” She laughed as Carson flinched and tried to stammer a response. “How many of them Khan slaves up and vanished into thin air under your watch boy? How many in the years before them? Too many.”\n\nFinding his voice Carson pleaded with her “Wait, I could give you the others. Tell you where they went! Anything!”\n\n“You’re the last one Carson, they gave you up.” A choked sob came from the kneeling man as she dashed his hope. “Now young man, which of these fine trees would you like to lay under?”"

She was nursing her third beer of the afternoon and stared off into space whenever she wasn’t talking. A pair of grey cats slept in the windowsill to Muriels left, ignoring the two womens conversation. Rolling pin in hand, Muriel spoke over her shoulder “Oh and did you hear? Gusty wants me to start banging the drum for him again.”\n\nEvelyn barely looked up from her beer, grunting noncommittally in response before draining the last of the bottle.\n\nTaking no notice, Muriel continued “I suppose I can help him again; do some baking and put together some nice little signs. This land does need shaking now and then, idle hands need keeping busy.” In a thoughtful tone she then asked “What do you think dear, pies for the pious?”\n\nHer younger sister got up from the table in search of another drink, but stopped as she passed Muriel to steady herself on the other woman's shoulder before adding “And a gun for the godless!”\n\nEyes sparkling, Muriel waggled a finger on her free hand at Evelyn before replying “Oh that’s perfect!”"

His sister Muriel was busying herself straightening knick-knacks and picture frames that were already straight while his other sister quietly took gulps from her flask and gazed out the window. Annette was expected home any minute, was rather late in fact, and her aunts had decided to join him in greeting her. They’d moved inside to wait as the day wore on and Muriel began to complain of a chill in the air. Augustus moved to light a cigarette but couldn’t find a lighter before Evelyn's thin voice cut through the quiet “She’s here.”\n\nWithin a few moments, the front door swung open and in walked young Annette to be greeted by a speechless room. Her father and aunts were silent not out of awkwardness, but in surprise at her attire. She wore a fine cream coloured dress adorned with black dahlia flowers that ran up the side to entwine around her collar, impressively preserved and practically sparkling. Augustus’ sisters soon found their voices and cooed over the young woman, praising her beauty and the dress.\n\n“Where’d you find that Annie? Surely it cost a pretty penny.” The Baron stood and stepped forward to look his daughter in the eyes.\n\n“Ezekiel gave it to me. Said he found it in some strange shop out west.” Annette’s eyes were sly, waiting to see her fathers reaction.\n\nEyes wide, he asked “You saw him?”\n\nShe reached into her bag as she answered “Once.

Is that you out there?” his voice slid through the dusty silence. The response was delayed but when it came he heard a long anguished moan echo through the estate. Now Augustus rushed for his gun, thinking a feral ghoul had somehow slipped inside. He straightened up just in time to watch a man walk directly through his bedroom door.\n\nThe man let off a pale glow that filled the room with an unnatural light and illuminated the thick chains that hung off his body. A gaping hole took up much of the man’s torso, ragged but not bleeding. To Augustus’ shock he could see through more than the hole, the entire man was translucent! Even worse, he wore the face of Jacob Saunders. Stumbling back, the Baron cried out “Jake? But you’re dead!”\n\nThe figure responded in a voice that dragged through each word as if speaking was an agony, “I am Gus but I’ve come here for you, in the chains I forged in life. You will be visited –” If he had more to say it was cut off by an explosion of gunfire. The spectral man vanished with a moan and jangling of chains as Augustus reloaded his gun. He’d heard more than enough of that and he’d be damned if some figment of his imagination was going to try messing with him."
