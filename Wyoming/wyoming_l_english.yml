  PRO_BOSS_MORGHORL_NAME: "Boss Morghorl"
  PRO_BOSS_MORGHORL_DESC: "More clever and vicious than his many co-workers, the glowing boss of Far Son has whipped them into a frenzied warband ready to follow his every whim. Those whims are mostly violent or involve the gathering of supplies for muddled plans to “expand” their mining operations. Whatever he chooses to pursue, destruction will follow."
  PRO_MONTAGUE_THE_MAD_NAME: "Montague the Mad"
  PRO_PROSPECTOR_HURRMGH_NAME: "Prospector Hurrmgh"
  SIE_chief_name:0 "Chief Orange-Sky"
  SIE_chief_desc:0 "Though leading his people on a journey of their own, Orange-Sky keeps alive in his heart the words of a long past elder “Always Take Care of One Another”. Those words have caused him to pause and take up the defense of Rawlins Township against the dangers that beset it. Compassion tempers his bold and decisive nature, and his age has not dulled his aim with a rifle or his piloting of a motorcycle. He has no intention of failing in his duties, neither to his people or those he has sworn to protect."
  SIE_cowgirl_name:0 "Ophelia "Killer Queen" Mayweather"
  SIE_cowgirl_desc:0 "With the beasts from beneath the earth banished, and the Arapaho having resumed their long journey south, it has fallen to Sheriff Mayweather to lead the people of Rawlins and the surrounding area into the future. Inspired by the banner hanging in the center of her hometown, she is determined to revive the “clean and quiet Wyoming” that her ancestors once enjoyed. Headstrong, proud and a crackshot, she intends to put the leadership skills she's learned from the Chief to the test."
  SIE_inquisitor_name:0 "Confessor Carter"
  SIE_inquisitor_carter_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "Miracles happen everyday with the blessing of the Great Atom, but if they go unwitnessed how can the faithful sing their praises? Musings such as these haunted Carter even as he arrived in the Dakotas alongside his brothers and sisters in search of the holy silos. When the opportunity came to trek out on his own as an evangelist and pilgrim, Carter could not resist and made his way further west. He arrived in the wide open spaces of Wyoming, discovering a land recently torn by war and struggle, and in dire need of spiritual aid. In the midst of this woe however lay a wondrous gift; Carter wept as he walked the tunnels below Far Son and felt the glow of Atom wash over him.This was to be the genesis of a new temple, and a new Confessor who wanted nothing more than to share the faith with his new flock."
  SIE_paladin_name:0 "Paladin-Marshall Wayne"
  SIE_paladin_advisor_desc:0 "Wayne ain’t troubled by much, not much other than the infighting back home with the rest of the Brotherhood. And he don’t brook with much trouble, so away he went. Landing in Rawlins and deputized by Ophelia he’s now making his mark among the people. His hat is big, his head is big, and his armor has seen better days but his spurs sure do jingle jangle jingle."
  SIE_joyful_name:0 "Joyful Division"
  SIE_joyful_desc:0 "Joyful Division is Confessor Carter's masterwork, the product of months, nay, years of traveling and recruiting wayward souls into his quest for Atom's glory. A machine so efficient and ruthless in her definition of what a good human must be that she could wrestle the veil of Atom's vision over the mortal coil. So, abide by his vision she did once graced, for as Carter gave his first sermons to her, she fell infatuated into his Incarnationism. He spoke of the old Caves of the Son, of Atom's glory and love, and of the blessed glow and great division to come. They knew that the glow must be the radiation whispering and creeping across the mists, and that where others would sicken and rot in the radiation, a robot would not. Surely, in both their eyes, that meant that robots were a part of Atom's vision?\n\n So it was that what once was a machine designed to quell riots fell deep into raging evangelism. With such endeavoring zeal proving all his visions true, the Confessor declared her a new Atomite Saint, destined for greatness and glory, and left the flock to her. In this succession, Joyful Division is 105% sure in her purpose."
  SIE_maverick_name:0 "Rooster Maverick"
  SIE_bumford_name:0 "Bumford Haley"
  SIE_bumford_advisor_desc:0 "A once deeply skeptical and violent man, Bumford was changed by his baptismal journey to the Caves of the Son. Now a deeply faithful and violent man, he has become a pure and guileless champion of Atom. Where others have sweeter voices and more blessed minds, Bumford is mighty in arm and filled with undoubting faith in his fellow atomites. His crude life as a hunter of the Hohenee is forgotten now, meaningless now that he has become a conduit of divine wrath."
  SIE_glowing_eagle_name:0 "Glowing Eagle"
  SIE_glowing_eagle_advisor_desc:0 "The man once known as Cheering Eagle was among the first of the Arapaho pathfinders to walk the mine shafts and tunnels stretching below Far Son, tasked with rooting out any surviving Mole Miners and their fellow beasts. Like the others he wore a radiation suit and took the medicines needed to resist the rads permeating these underground lairs. Unlike the others, who left those caves feeling ill and weary to the bone, Eagle felt energized and inspired by the experience. When the faith of the Atomites began to spread around Rawlins, Cheering Eagle immediately understood that he was chosen by Atom and gave himself to the Joyful Division. The now Glowing Eagle has lost none of his skill as a pathfinder, and has much to teach the less experienced members of the church."

  SIE_many_earrings_name:0 "Many Earrings"
  SIE_many_earrings_advisor_desc:0 "For over a decade, when the Arapaho needed a trade arranged with outsiders or supplies planned for a long journey they have looked to Many Earrings. The bulk of her youth was spent away from the rest of her people, traveling with caravans and walking ruined roads from Yellowstone to Whitehorse. Over those years she became a shred merchant and caravan quartermaster, returning home as a wealthy woman. Those riches were put towards the good of her people, earning deep respect and approval from both the rest of the tribe and her uncle, Chief Orange-Sky. With the Mole Miners dead and gone and her uncle choosing to stay in Rawlins, Many Earrings has settled in for the long haul. Patrols, caravans and wandering travelers alike come to her for logistical advice and trade appraisals."
  SIE_joe_teaches_name:0 "Joe Teaches"
  SIE_joe_teaches_advisor_desc:0 "The oldest living member of the Arapaho nation, Joe has been teaching their children for as long as anyone can remember. Generation after generation sat before Joe to learn not just their letters and numbers, but the history of the land, the ways of the wide open plain, and how to repair and maintain old technology. Quick to laugh and blessed with seemingly infinite patience, they are a beloved fixture to the rest of the Arapaho who can scarcely imagine life without their old teacher around. With Orange-Sky settling the rest of Joe’s people in and around Rawlins, the old educator has, without missing a beat, begun to invite the new neighbors to come around for lessons whether they be child, elder or anything in between."
  SIE_cork_name:0 "Cork"
  SIE_cork_advisor_desc:0 "When Far Son and the shafts and tunnels beneath it were scourged by the Highland Watch, the former security team of the long-gone Alton Bourges Mining Concern were wiped from the earth as well. Except for one. While the rest of the troop of glowing ones were gunned down, one stayed out of sight and for a time out of mind. The Watch found him after the battle hiding inside an overturned mine cart, only to be surprised when the luminescent ghoul threw up his hands in surrender. Dubbed Cork by those who took him prisoner for the hacking sounds the ghoul made when trying to speak, he was eventually able to communicate in a rudimentary way with Sheriff Ophelia, who chose to pardon the pitiable creature. He has found a place amongst the people of Rawlins helping to explore and scavenge the irradiated tunnels that run under Wyoming. Paid typically in bottles of Old Roamin Walkers Ale, Cork is happier than he’s been in centuries."
  SIE_davis_keyes_name:0 "Davis Keyes"
  SIE_davis_keyes_advisor_desc:0 "While others around Rawlins are better shots or shrewder trailblazers, Davis Keyes provides the food that keeps those folks fed. Even before the Moles spilled forth from Far Son the man maintained the largest herds of Bighorners around, growing wealthy off trading their meat and hides, and with many of the other ranchers now having fallen in the war Keyes has gained a near monopoly. Wise enough to know gouging his neighbors would likely see him hanged, Keyes has chosen not to abuse this sudden rise in prominence, instead putting his caps towards outfitting the Watch with the best gear that can be found. After all, what’s a Bighorner Baron with no one alive to sell to?"
  SIE_jed_russo_name:0 "Jed Russo"
  SIE_jed_russo_advisor_desc:0 "‘Ratty’ Jed Russo was once the black sheep of Rawlins, often finding himself spending weeks in jail for theft or dealing chems. When the Moles laid siege to the town Jed was in just a situation, tossed into a cell for peddling psycho behind the saloon. Rather than leaving them to rot, Sheriff Ophelia released all her prisoners and asked them to aid in the town’s defense. To the surprise of everyone, including himself, Jed proved to be a ferocious and fearless fighter against the invading monsters. With a shotgun and bowie knife, the former petty crook racked up kill after kill and was soon seen as a hero by those he fought alongside. The thrill of battle and the admiration of others has proved to be more intoxicating for Jed than any chem, and leading others into the fray is the perfect blend of both."

  nf_wyr.1.d:0 "To many, the steppes of Wyoming were a welcome escape: a lonesome road for travelers on their way to the woeful lands of Colorado, or a steady trail on a pilgrimage to legends of civilization to the west. However, in the days just before the war that broke the world, that peace and solitude was shattered irrevocably. With the arrival of the Alton Bourges Mining Concern in southern Wyoming, it was not long before economic and ecological chaos broke out. Despite heavy protest from many local towns and ranchers, the company purchased much of the region's land and all its mines. \n\nSetting up a new HQ in the tiny town of Farson after evicting the inhabitants, it was not long before their drills, explosives, and picks started to shake the very land apart. Working in a frenzy, they were setting up dig sites and new massive drills as quickly as possible. While many locals were hired to help construct these new machines and excavations, there was little to no regard for safety. Injuries and fury over bounced checks mounted, yet the company still found the money to pay for a security staff to keep out those protesting and any other troublemakers.\n\nIn truth, Alton Bourges had spent nearly every penny he had on this venture, hoping to make an enormous score under the nose of his larger rivals. He'd spent much time in the Appalachian hills spying on the Atomic Mining Services' experiments with nuclear mining and ultracite. Determined to recreate their success and results, he pushed his staff and miners to start blasting before the last of the cash dried up. On October 15th, he got much more than what he wanted: the company had managed to procure a dirty bomb. When detonated, it turned Farson and much of the area into a radioactive nightmare. Relief efforts had barely begun when the rest of the world followed into irradiated madness. \n\nWhat supplies had been gathered for relief before the bombs dropped?"

  nf_wyr.2.d:0 "It was rare news to hear that a new vault had been discovered, especially in places as far flung from old American population centers as Wyoming, but that was nonetheless the word that swiftly traveled down the dusty trails and into each settlement around. During a violent storm a team of scavengers had taken shelter within an outcropping of boulders only to find a tunnel hidden away in the rocks' midst. Following it down into the earth out of curiosity as much as desire for safety, the group eventually arrived at a wide cavern overlooked by a massive steel door. On the door was a thick layer of dust and paint displaying a yellow number nine. \n\nWhen the scavengers returned home, they reported their discovery to those in power and recounted their failed attempts to open the vault door. With more equipment and aid, it could surely be cracked open however. An untouched vault is a mystery hard to ignore, as even out in the plains of Wyoming folks had heard legend of Vault-Tecs secretive hideaways. The scavengers did soon return to the vault, this time with armed guards and experts who were certain they could get the door open. \n\nTheir confidence was perhaps misplaced, as science, engineering, demolitions and yelling into the intercom all had the same effect: nothing. The difficulty only made those involved all the more anxious to find out what was inside. It wasn't until the lead of the old scavenging team, in a flight of fancy, walked up and knocked on the door that there was a response. The massive entrance to the vault began to shift, agonizingly slowly. Would it be a whole forgotten society of dwellers? A mass grave filled with bones and cruel experiments? Perhaps a trove of wondrous pre-war technology waited within? When the door finally finished opening, they were greeted by a cacophonic chorus of barks and howls."

  nf_pro.1.d:0 "In the years after the bombs fell, Wyoming became a land of hardship and desperation for many. Few bombs fell in the state itself, but around the old Far Son radiation still spewed out into the air at regular intervals and poisoned the immediate surroundings. The rest of the former Alton Bourges Mining Concern's dig sites were no safer, and those who were wise gave them a wide berth. Instead those who had lived nearby went east and settled around the town of Rawlins, which had been a proud base of operations for those opposed to the Mining company before the war. Ranchers and farmers, cowboys and survivalists slowly trickled into the area to all pitch in and rebuild. They watched as cattle turned to brahmin, taters to tatos and the first ghouls emerged from sweeping radstorms. \n\nUnbeknownst to them, something stirred in the tunnels to the west, as one by one the mines collapsed by the blasts long ago were reopened from the inside. Wearing heavy uniforms and masks all emblazoned with faded Alton Bourges logos, mumbling and gasping men emerged into the sunlight for the first time in many decades. At first their neighbors in Rawlins Township had no idea what to make of these strange folks, but when they began arming themselves and stalking the trails for people to snatch up it became clear they meant nothing but trouble. Attacks slowly escalated year by year, and soon there were few who dared to live outside the makeshift walls of the town. \n\nWhat did the mole miners arm themselves with?"

  nf_pro.2.t:0 "Dig, and Dig, and Dig"
  nf_pro.2.d:0 "The former employees of the Alton Bourges Mining Concern, when they weren't wandering the countryside looking for materials and prey, often milled about the mines they had been trapped within. They were often aimless and confused, even scuffling amongst themselves over the shiniest of junk or most dangerous of weapons. They were still a threat to the people in neighboring lands and travelers but not one unified in purpose enough to pose a threat to a fortified township like Rawlins. That changed when the ground at the Far Son began to crumble away and a new group of mole miners emerged. \n\nAt their head was a truly vicious and cunning example of their kind, Boss Morghorl, who none of the other moles would dare to challenge. At his side was a small troop of glowing ghouls, carrying the gear and weapons of the security staff that once protected Alton Bourges property from the Wyoming locals. Most were as dim and confused as their miner colleagues but one still had a somewhat intact head on his shoulders: former security chief Montague. Together the two wasted little time in browbeating the various scattered groups of mole miners into something resembling an organized warband. \n\nThey were first instructed to gather a stockpile of:"
  nf_pro.2.a:0 "Weapons of all kinds."
  nf_pro.2.b:0 "As much scrap as they could carry."

  nf_pro.3.d:0 "With a cacophony of rattling breaths and irritable grunts a team of mole miners, two dozen strong, made their way into the clearing outside Boss Morghorls lair. More of their co-workers watched on from the loosely assembled barricades the creatures had erected to defend the irradiated ruin from any who'd dare to trespass. These arriving miners were a scavenging pack, sent out to bring back anything useful that could be carried. Some carried the scrap metal, weapons and batteries they were expected to retrieve; things that could be used for the Bosses plans (even if none of the miners had a clue what those plans actually were). The rest however had their arms and pockets full of new items: bottles of beer and spirits as well as boxes of cigarettes and chems. \n\nAs they dumped their loot in a great pile Security Chief Montague crawled forth from his collapsed office, several of his glowing lieutenants in tow. He quietly hissed with delight while stealing fearful glances at the lopsided building the Boss would surely emerge from sooner or later. Drool dripped from his luminescent jaws as he scooped up the various intoxicants, either stuffing them into the gaps and pockets of his armor or shoving them into the arms of his subordinates. The miners milled about, watching this display with disinterest and confusion and waiting for the Boss to emerge. The chief had impressed upon the team before they left that such items were vitally important but they couldn't fathom why. Most of the booze and chems had been carried away and hidden within the collapsed ruins the security crew dwelled inside when heavy stumping footfalls echoed from inside the Boss's lair. \n\nMontague hesitated by the spoils pile as the rest of the ghouls scattered out of view, trying to see if anything was left and not wanting to be seen running away. Morghorl emerged from the shadows of his home, bending down to fit through the doorway, and moved to inspect the scavenger packs offering. All of it met with his silent approval until he reached down to retrieve a single bottle of beer, barely visible in his huge hands. Montague first avoided his bosses glare then attempted to make an endearing smile with his remaining three teeth. Such tactics did little to blunt the huge mole man's rage, and Morghorl hurled the bottle into his security chief's face. A single angry bark from the boss made it very clear to the miners and the stunned ghoul that no more time was to be wasted on such worthless treasures."

  nf_pro.4.d:0 "Boss Morghorl, lord of the mole miners and other creatures of Far Son, sank into his favorite chaise lounge with a slight sigh. His massive frame taxed the aging chair and it creaked loudly in protest. Ignoring its complaints, he reached for the highball glass that he’d filled with gin and poured a slug through the filter of his mask. It was a matured spirit and he savored its heat as his lair was filled with the soft sounds of violins coming from the battered holotape player that rested on his floor.\n\nSpeaking to the darkness softly he mused “When I was a child, mother claimed monsters do not exist. Today however I bear witness to her falsehood. For a monster am I. The monsters were never under my bed. Because the monsters were in my head. I fear no monsters, for no monsters I see. Because all this time the monster has been me.”\n\nHe then sat silent until the sound of thumping footsteps came echoing down the hallway outside his door. Heaving himself to his feet, the great mole miner shut off the music and poured the last of the gin down his gullet quickly. A thudding knock came at the door and he answered with a gargled “begourledoc?”"

Unable to tend to the brahmin or retrieve food, the creatures had inadvertently besieged the townsfolk. On one gusty morning however, an outbreak of gunfire and war cries signaled a turning of the tide as a well armed and numerous party of newcomers struck the bewildered deep dwellers from behind. The molemen panicked and fled back west towards their tunnels, as the people of Rawlins cheered for their saviors. It was not long before those outside the walls called for Rawlins to open the gates and send someone to meet their leader. \n\nSheriff Ophelia Mayweather stepped forth, the de facto leader of the Rawlins Township, head held high but heart filled with a mixture of relief and nervous energy. The leader of the newcomers was an unassuming older man with a hard face but eyes filled with compassion. He introduced himself as Chief Orange-Sky, and his people as the Arapaho nation. They had come from the northwest on a great journey south, but had stopped upon seeing the dire situation of the town. Speaking long into the night, their meeting ended with Orange-Sky as the head of a new coalition that would stand against the monsters from beneath Far Son until they were no more: the Highland Watch. \n\nWhat did the Arapaho bring with them in excess?"

  nf_sie.3.d:0 "    It had been only a handful of days since the scouring of Far Son and the rest of the mole men's lairs. Many of the Watch were still being treated of their wounds, or chasing scattered miners into the hills, but the most important matter on everyone's minds was what happened now. Back in Rawlins, many people were celebrating their triumph, breaking out steaks and bottles of Old Roamin' for the biggest party they could manage. While the streets buzzed with cheer and activity, there was a reserved tension within the town hall. Within, numerous figureheads gathered to decide the future of the Highland Watch and the two peoples who had come together to form it. \n\n Chief Orange-Sky and Sheriff Mayweather, naturally, were the leaders: the same heroes who had slain Boss Morghorl. The purpose of the discussion was to determine whether the time had come for the Arapaho to move on and continue their journey south, or if perhaps they should make a new home for themselves here with the people of Rawlins and to stay for good. \n\nMany had made their cases, each speaking before the chief in turn, knowing that his word would be the last. Two Eagles argued loudly that they had only barely begun their journey, that if they were ever to make their way to Oklahoma and find their southern kinsfolk they needed to move on as soon as possible. Water Fly countered by saying that no one was even sure the southern Arapaho still existed. \n\nWhen the last of the Arapaho had spoken, Sheriff Mayweather stood up to speak, her hat gripped tight in her hands and close to her chest. “Now, it ain't really my place to say too much about all this, but if ya'll decide you need to go, then you need to go. I think we all understand that. But I do want to say somethin', anyway: ya'll are the best damn neighbors we could have asked for, and we'd all be mole food or somethin' by now without you. Well, I don't know if they eat, really, but you know what I mean. We'd love for you to stay and help us bring this whole area back from the dumps. I ain't too sure if we can do it without you, though I'm damned sure gonna try either way. That's, uh-- that's my piece.” She sat her hat back on her head, respectfully withdrawing as the other townsfolk in the room nodded and murmured in agreement. \n\n When the room had gone silent it was time for Chief Orange-Sky to declare his decision."

  nf_sie.4.t:0 "Friendship"
  nf_sie.4.d:0 "It had only been a short time since the siege of Rawlins had been broken by the arrival of the Arapaho nation, but much had been done already. Walls were being repaired, pairs of scouts  had been sent out in all directions and the caravan of the new arrivals had been set up into a makeshift town of its own. Despite the threat that still hung over them all, the people of Rawlins had celebrated their deliverance with a feast of freshly slaughtered Brahmin and toasted their new Arapaho allies with whatever alcohol they had left. A hopeful and comradely air had quickly settled over both peoples, as they swapped stories and made plans for the future. \n\nWind rushed through the streets of Rawlins two days after the party, past two figures seated at a table near the center of town. Chief Orange-Sky and Sheriff Ophelia Mayweather shared lunch and cigarettes while speaking of what had happened and what was to come. Over them hung a banner that had been in place as long as anyone in Rawlins could remember, the faded words upon it reading 'Rawlins for a Clean and Quiet Wyoming'. Not far from the two were several arapaho warriors showing a group of the local townsfolk how to clean and service a motorcycle, and a group of children dashing about and playing 'shoot the mole'. \n\nAfter finishing the last of her steak, Ophelia asked the Chief what had been on her mind since she had first met the man: “Why did you risk your people to help us? Why are you still risking it?” \n\nChief Orange-Sky drained the last of his bottle of Old Roamin' Walkers Ale and looked away for a moment before fixing his gaze directly on Ophelia's. “When you are a leader, you will always be taking risks. It's choosing the right risks to take that are the important part. For me, and my people, this was always the right risk to take. Had we looked upon you in your time of need and turned away, we could not have looked each other in the eyes for shame. Leaving you now would be little better. Some of it is undoubtedly pride but there are words I have carved into my heart, words from a past elder.”  \n\nThe old chief's eyes went distant and wistful, as if he was suddenly somewhere else. Ophelia waited patiently for him, studying the lines in his face. Orange-Sky then shook his head lightly before continuing “He said to us, 'Always take care of one another.'” The two sat then in silent thought for a long while, one thinking pensively of the past and the other excitedly of the future."

  nf_sie.5.d:0 "Rawlins wasn't much of an active town, so when tin men wearing rusted power armor came through, it quickly became the talk of the town. For a short while, it wasn't anything more than something for porch sitters to gossip about, until the strange newcomers barricaded a hotel and refused to leave. Now it was something for Sheriff Mayweather to handle. Hat tilted low over her brow, boot-spurs jangling with every step, she approached the leader of the new arrivals. \n\nHis name was Paladin Wayne, and he and his men had deserted after a schism in the Montana Expedition of the Brotherhood of Steel. Though she had never heard of the Brotherhood or their oddball struggles before, she made a deal with him and the remnants: stay in Rawlins, help the people, and they would give them a home and hospitality like never before. \n\nWayne smiled, and held out his hand for a hearty shake.

For most, he was an asshole with a hat big enough to fit two regular men and only one of his ego-inflated head, but to some, they knew him to be nothing if not a practical soul. So, when he strolled right on into the gunsmith's shop, adjusting his mighty-fine belt as any self-respecting cowboy would, he had a simple demand: "Son, I'd like to see how you gun." \n\nAnd boy, were the gunsmith and his workers were more than happy to show him.\n\nWhen he was done looking at their ways, he rubbed his helmet's metal chin, humming a discordant off-beat western tune, and he turned back to the gunsmith. "Mind if I try?" \n\nAnd try he did. He tried so fast and hard-- and with a bit of cheating Brotherhood gumption-- he tried so good the boys from back around never needed to try again."

Word among his flock is that a vision told him of a machine, one so divine that he had traveled across most of the states to get here.

No more pretense was given; they Incarnationists, the Atomites, they were here to stay, and stay they would: as the new force of law and order. Her first words to the people were simple: "Look upon your weak! They break beneath the glow of a God who sees us not for what we are but for what we can be. Do you not wish to champion his wishes? Do you not wish to carry the blisters of his blessing? The succulent pustules of ichor shall drip from the very heavens and fall upon you and me, and grace us all as one.

  nf_sie.10.d:0 "Orange-Sky approached the finish line of the impromptu race track a number of his people had taken to using. Some days it was for practice, some for testing vehicles, others for leisure. Today however he’d been invited to meet a promising driver who wanted to ride with the Arapaho. And the old chief was certainly impressed; the driver clearly had a lead foot but handled every bump and turn with ease. Their time around the track was only a few seconds behind the best recorded times.\n\n“Well, let us meet with them,” Orange-Sky told those with him as he walked. “They’re a talented driver no doubt.” He stopped in place and shock ran across his face however as he watched a mole miner squeeze itself out of the cramped vehicle. The moleman appeared anxious as he shuffled forwards towards the speechless chief.\n\nThe arapaho youths who had brought him here crowded around Orange-Sky now, exclaiming to him “Chief hear us out. He’s a natural driver! And he’s friendly, not a mean bone in his body. We’ve been calling him Jerf.” Still incredulous, Orange-Sky remained silent until Jerf extended a gloved hand out towards him to shake his hand."

  nf_atom.1.d:0 "Along the borders of [ROOT.getname], refugees gathered in massive camps. The first thing our patrols could recall was the crying: more were sick or wounded than were otherwise. For those who saw them firsthand, common reports were lost limbs and people covered in radiation sickness-induced vomit. When the refugees were pressed for answers as to what happened, they said that the Highland Watch had fallen-- and in its place, monstrous zealots had taken over. The survivors called them "Incarnationists," a mad cult who believed the closest way to Atom was to become one with the very glow that destroyed the world. Many speculate they may be looking our way, soon..."

  nf_mrr.1.d:0 "The Marshall Republic draws its roots early: before the war, before the nukes, there were Free States-- anarchists, secessionists, doomsday preppers-- you name it, they were it. Though the movement that originated out of Appalachia, words of its prophetic calls were heeded by others, and in the wake of Alton Bourges' corporate ventures, they were anything but tolerated, especially as more and more of his work force began to identify as members of the movement. \n\nThe Free Staters stood as tall as they could, fighting back against strikebusters and psuedo-pinkertons with all their might, but they were losing fast. Things ended up becoming so bad that even the National Guard was called in as a response to the strikes and presentations across the state.\n\nIt was only when the bombs fell that the Free Staters were saved within their bunkers, and their enemies left to fend for themselves as nuclear winter settled upon the lands outside. It was in the ashes after the fallout that the Free Staters emerged, seeing their old foes in the National Guard having survived as ghouls. Surprisingly, they left behind their grudges, and they began to resettle the surface once more as brothers and sisters of the Free States-- or, as they would soon be known, the Marshall's Republic."

  nf_mrr.2.d:0 "The Baron and his Eyrie have long since lorded over the Wyoming Frontier, the Baron Augustus Bailey being yet another longwinded shadow of the corporate taint of pre-war America. As much as Jack Reed and other higher-ups in the Republic despised him, they knew his men had most of the shopkeepers, farmers, and scavs in his pocket. Resisting him was not an option...\n\nOr was it? After all, he's just one baron... And rumor has it that a couple of newcomers in the west have his eye."

Still, there are those with stalwart hearts and a care for what matters most: surviving in a world once-destroyed. Hushed whispers speak of the heroes of The Last Redoubt, the same who stand against the madness beyond the walls-- but some know better. They struggle to make it in there, but they are survivors for a reason. With designated meeting spots, we send quarantine crews to conduct trade operations with the denizens of the Redoubt, offering supplies and knowledge to one-another. \n\nThough it is a quaint thing, friends in the wastes are nothing to ever balk at."

  nf_mrr.4.d:0 "Across the Upper Missouri and beyond the wall lays an unusual ally of ours: the Marshall Republic, who have long-since met with some of our traders to give us objects from the outside in exchange for goods from the inside. Of course, they always do so in hazard suits, but such is to be expected when dealing with matters of plague."

  nf_mrr.5.d:0 "In years past, Rapids City had been a derelict shell full of raiders and tribals, dominated in large by the raging Four Fathers tribe. It was only in their fervor that we pushed east, sacking them out of their ancient home outside the mountain and pushing them north. \n\nSince then, the city has become a haven for the wayward-- a place where sensible people can come to make something of themselves. As such, it's led to an influx of people into our quaint little republic, all with their own ideas and machinations. Whilst many carried themselves with pride, others were more motivated by more primal things such as greed. Who did the people look out for?"

It was there we met the Four Fathers: fanatical tribals hellbent on worshipping a ficticious rendition of the Founding Fathers. We fought tooth and nail against them after their first 'divine movements' against us, but we only pushed them north. Their numbers are great, and it was only our firepower and experience that allowed us to break their hold on the region.\n\nEven now they rest, gathering strength to the north-- and they intend to return home soon. \n\nAs if things couldn't be worse, our friends to the south-- the Highland Watch-- are in danger. Supposedly, Mole Miners have burst forth from the ground and threaten to consume all of Wyoming in their wake! Though we may be able to send a helping hand, it would open us up for a quickened attack from the Four Fathers. It may be risky, but losing the Watch to monsters is a costly thing indeed..."

We have a chance here to do more than just defy the man, we could put together a small force to liberate some of our own goods he’s taken from us. If the Four Fathers weren’t always plotting we could maybe do more but a raid will have to suffice. Our soldiers will slip into the Eyrie and attack Baileytown while most of the family's thugs are off killing tribals and be out before they know what happened."

Those cowardly opportunists must have been emboldened by most of our finest soldiers being away battling the savage Khans. They look to be raiding storehouses and supply barns and causing a real ruckus. We’ll make them pay for this someday, but for now we need to decide how to respond. Men and workers could be rapidly conscripted to fight them off but it’ll likely be a bit of a bloodbath, or we can let the money and supplies go. What do we do?"

So a retreat was sounded, though one with their honour still intact. Though none of our misappropriated goods were liberated this act of defiance is still one worthy of celebrating, and perhaps it will leave the Baron in a weaker position against his other foes."

The storehouses raided were filled with a variety of goods, at least some of which were probably ours at some point and our soldiers liberated all they could carry. More than enough to have some left over after a celebration, not just for what they walked away with but for this successful act of defiance.
