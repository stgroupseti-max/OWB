tpm_minutes_of_madness:0 "Minutes of Madness"
tpm_minutes_of_madness_desc:0 "When the bombs dropped roughly two centuries ago, parish sheriff Alexander Callahan was just making his way into his home city of Lafayette. He ended up spending the next few terrible weeks picking up the shattered pieces of his life, doing his best to keep law and order in the radioactive remnants of his home. Why did a nuclear bomb fall on the explicitly civilian target of Lafayette, of all places? Nobody knows."
tpm_town_life:0 "Small Town Life"
tpm_town_life_desc:0 "As the decades rolled in, the refugee town that had been built on the outskirts of Lafayette started to creep inwards. After nearly half a century of exile, a handful of settlers with a vague background in forgotten sciences declared the city center safe for habitation once more. As our ancestors buried their forefathers, things began going back to something vaguely resembling normal. Life went on."
tpm_the_bluff:0 "The Scouring of the Bluff"
tpm_the_bluff_desc:0 "After a relatively lengthy period of post-war innocence, allowing Lafayette to rebuild itself, the first of many bandit gangs would attack the city in 2143, originating from a hideout in the forest surrounding the town of Moss Bluff. Some people got killed, but the good citizens of Lafayette rallied and formed a group of trusted law enforcement professionals to hunt down the bandits. And hunt them down they did."
tpm_gold_and_blue:0 "The Gold and Blue"
tpm_gold_and_blue_desc:0 "Since the formation of the Lafayette Patrolmen, a lot has changed, and a lot has stayed the same. The people of Lafayette trust the Patrol to protect them, affording the militia a level of latitude with regards to law enforcement that borders on corruption. Not that you'd be welcome to say it is, as that might get you laid low like the bandit you probably are."
tpm_trade_orleans:0 "Trade with New Orleans"
tpm_trade_orleans_desc:0 "New Orleans... What a city. It's amazing how a place can have such great music and such exquisit vibes while being completely overrun with organized banditry. But hey - Everyone's gotta deal with the devil sooner or later. To that end, some of our less morally-burdened merchants have struck a deal with the Orleans mob to get our hands on some of their fancier guns for a cheap price."
tpm_pirate_report:0 "Pirate's Report"
tpm_pirate_report_desc:0 "Looks like our brief foray into the Orleans underworld attracted some attention. And somehow, it wasn't the bad kind. Our merchants just struck a deal with some shady pirate-types from down in the Caribbean to keep an eye out for anything that might concern Lafayette going forward. Who knows, maybe having an extra private eye without moral qualms might be the ace up our sleeve we needed."
tpm_trade_memphis:0 "Trade with Memphis"
tpm_trade_memphis_desc:0 "Memphis is a strange city - or so we hear. Got some freak show circus running the place with a bunch of cult stuff on every block of the place. Robed fashion and all that - not exactly something you see every day. And yet, we've gotta admit they're not half bad at striking solid bargains. A handful of caps and we've got some slaves to turn loose as new citizens and some trinkets to justify the whole ordeal. Not bad."
tpm_skybound_designs:0 "Skybound Designs"
tpm_skybound_designs_desc:0 "Another one of those weirdos from Memphis showed up today with a backpack full of old world fighter blueprints. We're not sure where he picked up a list of designs this old, but he's willing to part with the whole package for a fairly moderate price. Who knows, maybe having a few planes lying around could come in handy someday?"
tpm_reinforce_legends:0 "Reinforce the Legends"
tpm_reinforce_legends_desc:0 "Gather 'round the campfire! Every year or so, the Patrol Chief likes to gather every man in the patrol (minus a skeleton crew to guard the city limits) to the city center to exchange stories. A neat, wide-open space with a few dozen fires for a few dozen parties of a few dozen people to group up and talk shop for a bit. Let's open up with a recent one. Y'all heard about that mutant pirate?"
tpm_cunningham_adventure:0 "Cunningham's Adventure"
tpm_cunningham_adventure_desc:0 "It's one of the Patrol's greatest points of shame that we weren't able to hold the city of Alexandria for any significant length of time after we seized the place back in 2243, but before the Gator Maws game roaring back into their old home we really messed the place up! The bastards had all sorts of weird and cruel stuff goin' on, and we probably saved hundreds of lives just by goin' in when we did. Sweet justice!"
tpm_george_adventure:0 "George's Adventure"
tpm_george_adventure_desc:0 "Some of the folks in the Patrolmen have been around for a fair few more winters than our younger members, and boy, do they have stories to tell. Sheriff George here took part in the Battle of Libercity, that time we humiliated the Rockets by doing their job for them. Bandits don't know borders, but for a price, neither can we. What an adventure!"
tpm_chiefs_contribution:0 "The Chief's Contribution"
tpm_chiefs_contribution_desc:0 "Callahan's not exactly a rookie to the service, but he ain't exactly a sage either. He got the title of chief directly from his big daddy, Old Man Callahan. That man was a legend, and our current chief earned his badge in that whole mess outside New Orleans... What was it, seven years back? Losin' track of time. Maybe the chief would be better to explain this one."
tpm_best_policy:0 "The Best Policy"
tpm_best_policy_desc:0 "Fact of the matter is the patrol ain't what it used to be. Leastwise, that's what the chief keeps muttering to himself, and it's startin' to rub off on the boys a bit. He's called a proper meeting of the patrol leads to get to the bottom of some of the issues he's been picking up on, and to be honest, nobody's really sure what to expect. I mean, I dunno what he's seeing, but things are goin' alright, ain't they?"
tpm_open_streets:0 "On the Open Streets"
tpm_open_streets_desc:0 "Callahan's been goin' mad! At least, that's the word on the street, but nobody'd dare say it to the guy's face. He's the Patrol Chief, after all. Still, he's been goin' around finding some of our lads seemingly at random and taking their badges from them right then and there. Maybe he's got a reason, but if he does, he ain't exactly publishing it in"
tpm_never_meet_heroes:0 "Never Meet Your Heroes"
tpm_never_meet_heroes_desc:0 "Turns out half the reason Callahan's been dumping some of our less productive patrol members has to do with cutting costs. Fair enough on that—he's taking the freed up funds and heading over to Dynamite Danny's to stock up on heavy weaponry! Man, we've been needing some of the fun stuff. Not for any real reason, we just wanna try it."
tpm_to_the_bottom:0 "To the Bottom of It"
tpm_to_the_bottom_desc:0 "Callahan's called two of our favorite practical jokers into his office for a meetup. Said somethin' about them goin' too far. Not quite sure what he means by that, but Kim and Tim Hardy are nearly pissin' their pants with fright over the whole issue. Hopefully they've got the right words to say to the chief."
tpm_callahan_revenge:0 "Callahan's Revenge"
tpm_callahan_revenge_desc:0 "Now that the chief's done making the rounds with the Patrol, he's called everyone together for a meetup. We all know what this is about — there's been a new wave of rumors floating about that the Cannery's keeping some of our boys as slaves from that raid up on Alexandria a few years back. Some are sayin' the chief's decided he wants to teach the Motors a lesson. And frankly? Most of the boys wouldn't object."
tpm_maw_wargoal:0 "Raiders to the North of Me"
tpm_maw_wargoal_desc:0 "We thought we punished the Gator gangs hard enough back in '49 that they'd stick to their own clay, but they've got a new leader and they're PISSED. That Sobek girl they've gone and put in charge of their band of bandits is causin' mayhem for anyone travelling through those swamps, and Alexandria's turned into a raider fortress we can't ignore. Gather the full Patrol—it's time to shoot some gators!"
tpm_maw_aftermath:0 "Here I Am"
tpm_maw_aftermath_desc:0 "One big part of the Second Battle of Alexandria ended up being just how quick the Chief was with his revolver. More than a few times, he saved one of our boys' lives just by bein' in the right place at the right time, with the right number of bullets sittin' in the chamber. Now that we've got a grip on the place, let's use it to get some better materials for our revolvers and figure out some training ideas to boot."
tpm_maw_side:0 "Sobek's Station"
tpm_maw_side_desc:0 "Sobek's throne in the heart of Alexandria's suburbs is a bloody thing. She's got butchered corpses hangin' from hooks and all that disgusting stuff you see in pre-war horror flicks. She ended up dyin' in that big last stand of hers, and we're pretty sure the Chief was the one that nailed her right between the eyes. He's feelin' awful bad about killin' a kid young as she was - but chances are he knows he did the right thing."
tpm_maw_core:0 "Dismantle the Chains"
tpm_maw_core_desc:0 "Just a few good patrols later and Alexandria's startin' to look like a normal town again. We've got settlers comin' up from Lafayette and the Lawmen are doin' a good job of makin' sure all the normal citizens who've been living in terror under the Gators know they're safe now. We did a good thing, here, and it feels like people can finally move safely through Alexandria's swamps once again."
tpm_bayou_wargoal:0 "Slavers to the South"
tpm_bayou_wargoal_desc:0 "'Cordin' to some reports one of our boys brought in on the Motors a few weeks back, he swears up and down he saw Ol' Patrol Lead Jenkins walkin' around the Cannery in chains doin' slave labor. We tried to confirm that report, but we can't get anywhere near it without gettin' shot at - and that's a guilty admission if we've ever heard one. It's about time we get our boys back!"
tpm_bayou_aftermath:0 "Stuck in the Middle"
tpm_bayou_aftermath_desc:0 "Stormin' the Cannery wasn't exactly an easy task. Real messy battle, but we got it in the end 'cause the Chief made sure he was in the planning room pointing out what trees were safe to hide behind and where we shouldn't shoot 'cause that'd damage the canning operation. Callahan's a strict chief, but he's got the right idea, and now we're the ones canning fish for the northern gulf."
tpm_bayou_side:0 "Resting Rumors"
tpm_bayou_side_desc:0 "So, uh... Well. \n After talkin' to a bunch of people for a long time, we're pretty sure there, uh... Um...  \n Well, we think there might've been some sorta misunderstanding about the whole "slaves" thing. Maybe."
tpm_bayou_core:0 "Patrol the Waves"
tpm_bayou_core_desc:0 "Stupid as that whole fight might've been, fact remains Lafayette's Lawmen are the new big dog running the Cannery, and it's probably gonna stick that way. After we got around to figurin' out the whole "slaves" thing that made us fight in the first place, most other issues went out the window. 'Course, there's still a bitter feeling from the locals 'bout what we did, but that won't stop us from protecting 'em."
tpm_tough_crowd:0 "With This Tough Crowd"
tpm_tough_crowd_desc:0 "With our two more problematic neighbors properly sorted out, Chief Callahan's got just enough time on his hands to start payin' attention to how things're goin' on around our humble city. Turns out, things aren't goin' great, and there's a monster droolin' over Louisiana that we've gotta be quick if we wanna not end up in a proper war with. Let's hope the Chief's up to the task."
tpm_elders_treachery:0 "The Elder's Treachery"
tpm_elders_treachery_desc:0 "That rusty rat Rusk! We'd hoped we could strike some kinda bargain with him and his bumblin' brotherhood, but he's gone and attacked us with our backs turned to 'im! Well, we're not the only boys in this corner o' the south who can pack a mean punch, and man, if Rusk ain't the guy that deserves a good punch right now, I dunno who is."
tpm_i_love_this_focus_name:0 "This is Stupid"
tpm_i_love_this_focus_name_desc:0 "Man, who here really wanted a war with Texas? I mean, what've they ever done to us, and what've we ever done to them? All they wanna do is take our stuff, and that makes 'em no better than bandits. We're gonna need a bit of time to get our boys up to scratch to deal with their armor, though. Let's just put up some barricades and see if we can hold what we've got for a bit before we try anything fancy."
tpm_obvious_tactic:0 "The Obvious Tacic"
tpm_obvious_tactic_desc:0 "The Brotherhood outa Dallas seems to all have the same thing in common—every last one o'them buggers is either wearing power armor or has a guy in armor right behind him. Sucks that that armor's immune to most of our small arms fire, and it double sucks that most of our guns count as small arms. Maybe we could get some bigger guns to punch 'em to pieces? Dynamite Danny's got us covered, for a price."
tpm_ALL_YOU_HAD_TO_DO:0 "Darnit, We're Heroes!" #WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN
tpm_ALL_YOU_HAD_TO_DO_desc:0 "Rusk's been at our gates for a while now, but we've shown we aren't afraid of him and his big tin bullies. But realistically, it'd be an awful lotta trouble to go take Dallas out from under 'em. Maybe the Chief can try to talk 'em down one more time, now that we've got things secure enough to give 'em time to think?"
tpm_the_dallas_meetup:0 "A Drive to Dallas" #in and out am i right
tpm_the_dallas_meetup_desc:0 "Callahan's decided to take a road trip to the old city of Dallas personally. He'll be back in a few days, but basically he's gonna have a chat with that Rusk fellow who's on the warpath over in Texas and startin' to look our way. We're hopin' he can be persuaded to have us as junior partners in his growin' sphere of influence, but if not, we might just have a fight on our hands." #riiiight
tpm_proving_worth:0 "Proving our Worth"
tpm_proving_worth_desc:0 "Well, we sure dodged a bullet with that one. The Brotherhood's made the call to let us be friends for the time bein', and it only seems right we make a show of proving we're worthy enough to be called friends in their eyes. Check this—let's get a bunch of our patrols and a bunch of their knights out and have a picnic or somethin'! We can do some joint patrols afterwards, as a treat. Sounds like a right splendid time for all."
tpm_armored_scouts:0 "Armored Scouts?"
tpm_armored_scouts_desc:0 "Man, that power armor the Brotherhood's got's pretty dang neat. One thing Callahan asked about after he and Rusk made their deal was gettin' our boys some of that armor. Rusk said he'd probably get shot dead on the spot if he gave us the blueprints without gettin' to know us a bit better first, but he slipped us some papers that oughta help us get started on makin' some fancier types of armor."
tpm_howdy_pardner:0 "Partners and Friends"
tpm_howdy_pardner_desc:0 "The Economic Union's got a buncha different groups in it by this point, but the three big'uns are Dallas, Lone Star, and Austin. We've been gettin' a buncha tourists comin' in from each of 'em, and some of our boys are startin' to form opinions about some of the cities just based on who they've been sendin' our way. Fun stuff!"
tpm_saints_and_sinners:0 "Peace in the Swamps"
tpm_saints_and_sinners_desc:0 "Well, thank God that's all over. What a mess. Texas ain't gonna threaten Lafayette any longer, and we've only gone and put a stone in Goliath's forehead to do it. This is why we patrol—to keep our home safe, and to make sure we get to keep on patrollin' 'till the sun don't shine no more!"
tpm_blackhat:0 "Donning the Black Hat"
tpm_blackhat_desc:0 "One o'the old traditions the Patrol Chiefs have got goin' for the last century or so is whenever things got out of control they'd take off their normal blue hats and throw a big black disc up top. Callahan's just taken out his great grandaddy's old black hat, and he's makin' a big stink about just how wrong somethin' with the patrol's income is. What are we, bankers?"
tpm_determined_defenders:0 "Determined Defenders"
tpm_determined_defenders_desc:0 "Huntsville's a nice town a little ways east of Austin. Callahan got word the other day that a gang a'mutant raiders was causin' havoc, and the Brotherhood was too busy to deal with it. The Chief packed up three patrols and drove directly to the place. Pretty sure we got all of 'em, but lost a few of our own guys in the process. Few more quit after seein' how angry the Chief could get when the cadets don't play ball."
tpm_steelhand_siege:0 "Steelhand's Siege"
tpm_steelhand_siege_desc:0 "Slappy Steelhand's one of the biggest bandit names in the Bluff. Somehow he'd managed to dodge our patrols in town for decades, runnin' the Bluff as if the whole place was his own little fief. But Callahan finally pinned the bastard to a concrete wall last night. After an all-night siege, we managed to take the bandit king out. That's one small victory for law and order that we needed right about now."
tpm_gunslingers_galore:0 "Gunslingers Galore"
tpm_gunslingers_galore_desc:0 "It's both a problem and a blessing that Texas was filled with Brotherhood lawmen before we signed on. Positives? Good gear and good training ready all 'round at a moment's notice. Negatives? They're a buncha roudy bastards with no self-control and no sense of respect. More than a few o'Texas's lawmen have wandered onto our turf and got themselves killed in silly duels o'er nothin'."
tpm_texan_attitude:0 "The Texan Attitude"
tpm_texan_attitude_desc:0 "Granbury's another little town just west o'Fort Worth. Not really anythin' too special. Least, not until Callahan just so happened to be in town with a patrol durin' a bank heist. The patrol leaped into action and right into an ambush. Bastards gunned down a good few dozen of our boys before we got the upper hand. In the end we saved the day and will be makin' good use of some of their gear goin' forward."
tpm_dismay_in_dallas:0 "Dismay in Dallas"
tpm_dismay_in_dallas_desc:0 "There's not really a right way to describe just how big a city Dallas really is. You forget there's a place outside of it, what with how much of it is concrete and asphalt. The locals aren't exactly fans of us, but realistically we ain't that different from the Brotherhood, so Callahan's been talkin' to a few prominent locals to smooth things over. Fingers crossed..."
tpm_cho_bang_stinks:0 "Cynicism in Lone Star"
tpm_cho_bang_stinks_desc:0 "Lone Star's one of those cities that just doesn't care about anythin' but money. They're pissed we took the place over, of course—who wouldn't be if it was Lafayette that lost?—but as long as they're still rich, they don't actually care. Let's slip a few extra caps in some of the right pockets and maybe it'll get some of their more annoying noises to quiet down a bit."
tpm_rusks_request:0 "Rusk's Request"
tpm_rusks_request_desc:0 "Old Elder Rusk's been seen wanderin' around Lafayette a little bit recently. Nobody's exactly sure what he's doin' here, but his visit's timed weirdly nice with a few reports outa Dallas about some of our boys stirrin' up trouble. Let's hope whatever they've gotta talk about ain't gonna hurt our lads."
tpm_open_for_business:0 "Open for Business"
tpm_open_for_business_desc:0 "Now that things've calmed down for a bit, let's take the time to really kick the Cannery's machines into gear. After all, who in all o'Texas wouldn't want fresh fish brought directly in from the coast? Wait, whaddya mean it's 110° outside even at night in Dallas?"
tpm_iron_exodus:0 "Iron Exodus"
tpm_iron_exodus_desc:0 "Since the Brotherhood's been pullin' out of Texas at large, a fair few of our lads who came onto our soil from the Brotherhood have decided now's the time to pull up their roots and move back west. Good riddance, we say—half those guys were probably bandits and the other half were just technogibbering morons who couldn't stand a patrol without their precious air conditioned suits."
tpm_texan_roulette:0 "Ain't Nobody Gonna Hurt My Home"
tpm_texan_roulette_desc:0 "Now that all's said and done, Patrol Chief Callahan's finally had a little bit of time to put his feet up and think about what comes next. The record ain't nothin' to scoff at: Bribes are at record lows, most of our boys are proud to serve, and a good number of 'em aren't even afraid of death anymore. If it means puttin' their bodies in between their bandits and their brothers? That's a pretty nice way to go."
tpm_desperados_wargoal:0 "The Menace of Shreveport"
tpm_desperados_wargoal_desc:0 "With the whole Texas thing dealt with, there's some bastards up in Shreveport we've been a bit salty with for a long time now. They ain't exactly as bad as Alexandria's Gators were, but they've got some real nasty ghoulish biker gangs we've been meaning to put down for helpin' the Gator Maws out back in '43. Rally the lawmen, and let's show those bandit biker's who they've been messin' with!"
tpm_the_goodies:0 "Garage Goodies"
tpm_the_goodies_desc:0 "With the Desperados taken down a notch, let's take a quick peak around Shreveport and see what we can find. There's a lotta buildings up here that look kinda like old factories, and this place either didn't get properly nuked or they've done a really nice joba hidin' the scars. Maybe we can turn some of these machines back on...?"
tpm_ghoulish_mechanics:0 "Ghoulish Mechanics"
tpm_ghoulish_mechanics_desc:0 "While it's not exactly lettin' the boys sleep easy knowin' the chief gave a buncha bandits a direct pardon, nobody's talkin' smack about Shreveport's mechanics or the bikes they've been makin'. We ain't exactly sure how useful lawmen on bikes would be compared to what we've normally got goin' on, but hey, some of these things are real nice to drive and they purr like mama's kittens."
tpm_this_is_a_reservation_focus_name_lmao:0 "A Moment Alone in the Shade" #can we please change this focus name, its bugging me
tpm_this_is_a_reservation_focus_name_lmao_desc:0 "Now that the patrol's got some time to itself, the Chief's sent out the order that we're to help out with some construction efforts for a bit. Nothin' too different than normal—sometimes a patrol needs to build a camp or a barricade or somethin' just as a course of the patrol itself. Still, it feels good to do somethin' a bit more permanent than just a treehouse in the middle of an empty forest." #im serious, and i know its such a petty and small thing but its bugging the crap outta me
tpm_big_iron:0 "A Hulking Mass of Iron"
tpm_big_iron_desc:0 "Few weeks back a big barge went and got itself beached down by the Cannery! It got abandoned pretty quick when one of our patrols started shootin' their guns in the air and its crew fled overboard and swam to a smaller boat off the shore flyin' the jolly roger, so as far as we're concerned, boat's fair game. Still, we should probably figure somethin' out before the bandits get it in their heads to come on back."
tpm_keats_clams:0 "Austin's Ideals" #Keats' clams, if only you could use grammar in ids :pensive:
tpm_keats_clams_desc:0 "Lotta folks over in Austin seem to like talkin' politics, and Lafayette's been taken aback by just how interested the men and mutants of the old Texan capital are with ideas of high governance. Callahan's delighted - apparently he's been hopin' the people here would get more interested in things bigger than themselves for a while, and he's hopin' a local political scene starts up soon. Most of the boys don't get him."
tpm_bangs_investments:0 "Lone Star's Investments"
tpm_bangs_investments_desc:0 "Lone Star's just got an endless supply of cash, it seems. No matter how many times Callahan thanks them but insists we really don't need their money, they just keep insisting on sending more caravans our way filled with goods we don't need somehow expecting to make a profit. They rarely do, but the caravans just keep comin'. Economics don't make much sense."

Who'd we be if we turned down good patrolmen just 'cause they've got an ironclad past? Nah, they're all fine boys, and they'll be even more fine when they've had to learn to survive a patrol without their fancier gadgets with 'em at all times."

tpm_made_me_pay_taxes_desc:0 "One'a the big issues Lafayette's been facing lately's got to do with our system of laws. We're lawmen, right? Our big job is to patrol around and make sure the laws don't get ignored. But for the last few decades at least it's always been the Patrol Chief that decides what the laws of Lafayette actually are, and it's about time Callahan got around to updating that mess. What'll he choose?"

It's not exactly a pretty thing, and while some more respectable folks here or there've tried to put a stop to it, they never succeed. We ain't got the brawn to beat the pirates at their own game in the heart'a the gulf, but let's pay a few local sailors to start patrollin' for us. Seems the least we can do."

tpm_good_soldiers_desc:0 "Orders straight from the Patrol Chief himself—if we see any Brotherhood-lookin' folks wandering aimlessly, we're to formally invite 'em over for lunch! Might be a half-jokey order, but given it's an order that gives the boys an excuse to take a break while on duty, it's an edict that'll probably get followed to the letter. Let's make the suits feel welcome!"
tpm_nobody_needs_to_know:0 "Nobody Needs to Know"
tpm_nobody_needs_to_know_desc:0 "Rumor's been goin' around one of our lads shot a paladin dead in the Efrafa Bar out by our border with the Rockets. Why? Guy thought the tin can cheated him in a poker game. That's it. Obviously Callahan's summoned the guy for a meeting, and some of the boys out back are taking bets on whether it's gonna be two or one man leaving that office after the fact."
tpm_what_it_is:0 "What It Is"
tpm_what_it_is_desc:0 "While the good citizens of Lafayette don't particularly care one way or the other that we've been reduced to a mere pawn in Texas's grand game, the Lawmen ain't forgettin' the level of freedom they once had. Gone are the days of romance and free patrols, of fighting bandits and making sure the law of the land got upheld at every turn. At the end of the day, our future will always lie with the Chief."
tpm_keats_buddy_pal_chum:0 "Friends in Green"
tpm_keats_buddy_pal_chum_desc:0 "Austin's super mutants have proven to be surprisingly generous friends. Most of our folks haven't ever seen a mutant—let alone fought one—but the few among our patrols who've gotten wires crossed with mutants and lived to tell the tell won't ever shut up about their experiences. Maybe now that we've seen the Texan brand of mutants, those nasty stereotypes will stop getting played up as much."
tpm_river_patrols:0 "River Patrols"
tpm_river_patrols_desc:0 "Lafayette's not exactly a seagoing city of sailors, but cross-contamination with Austin's culture is slowly shifting us towards that idea. If you've got a river nearby, why not take up a life of sailing the open seas? It's a far more free life than the rapidly-civilizing Texan countryside we're having to learn to live with, and there's plenty of bandits in the gulf to go hunt if we need more adventures."
tpm_heavier_industry:0 "Heavier Industry"
tpm_heavier_industry_desc:0 "While this was a pretty obvious consequence in retrospect, signing on with Austin's alliance meant a sudden influx of mutants curious to see how we've been living out in in Louisiana. Some of them have decided to stick around and become honest citizens of Lafayette, and their physical strength have made them excellent builders. Industry's booming with these big guys around!"
tpm_railroad:0 "The Austin-Cannery Rail Line"
tpm_railroad_desc:0 "One of Austin's few requests with regards to how we run our business involved the construction of a new set of roads connecting Lafayette and Austin directly, with most of the work running through the Brotherhood's old stomping grounds. They agreed to foot the bill for the project, but made it clear that it'd be awfully nice of us if we contributed more than we had to. It's an interesting idea, to be sure."
tpm_a_day_off:0 "Callahan's Day Off"
tpm_a_day_off_desc:0 "Callahan never really took to Keats like some other Texan leaders have. The guy's nice—nobody's disputing that—but Callahan's having trouble believing he's really that nice in a continuous manner. Like, come on, man, weren't you a soldier? How on God's green earth can you be so naively nice to everyone? We've gotta sort this thing out if we're gonna keep working with him."

###NEW STUFF
##LEFT
tpm_left_generic_opening:0 "The Way the Wind Blows"
tpm_left_generic_opening_desc:0 "Stuck between a rock and... well, an even harder rock, really. Only difference is the calibre. Best round up the boys and lay out a course of action that don’t end with us mashed into a fine paste."

tpm_left_offshoot:0 "Calling in Favors"
tpm_left_offshoot_desc:0 "The Lafayette Patrolmen have been around for well over a century – long enough to produce some tough ol’ geezers. Bit on the crusty side to be put on the frontlines maybe, but their noggins are as sharp as ever. The Chief will be making a few calls in the coming weeks, scrounging up as many of these retirees as possible."

tpm_left_diversifying_patrol:0 "Diversifying the Patrol"
tpm_left_diversifying_patrol_desc:0 "The Patrolmen have always stuck to what works– giving the hardest bastards in town who could be trusted to shoot straight a six-shooter and hoping for the best. But as our neighbours’ tactics evolve, we will have to follow suit. That process begins by sprinkling some variety into the force."

#OLD IS GOLD
tpm_left_old_is_gold1:0 "Old is Gold"
tpm_left_old_is_gold1_desc:0 "Lead Sheriff George Santos and Louis Fletcher, "The Shank" of Lafayette. Two men who could not be more different, both brought down by leg injuries sustained on the field – and both keen to prove their worth once again."

tpm_left_old_is_gold2:0 "Danny's Biggest Customers"
tpm_left_old_is_gold2_desc:0 "Dynamite Danny, the New Orleans scrapper with a bottomless pit of suppliers – and clearly even deeper well of high-society contacts with how often he’s walked out of nasty affairs with a big shit-eating grin - or so his aides say. Despite a few reservations from the Chief, the man has, ultimately, always come through for us - it's about time we formalise our business relations."

tpm_left_old_is_gold3:0 "Use Your Words"
tpm_left_old_is_gold3_desc:0 "A radio is, at the end of the day, a fairly straightforward little device – even a mutie could make sense of the wiring in a week’s training. We’ll just need a couple, tops!"

tpm_left_old_is_gold4:0 "Locked and Loaded"
tpm_left_old_is_gold4_desc:0 "We’ve got the experience, the equipment and the knowhow. Now we just oughta find a target for all that before some overeager greenie accidentally blows himself up – or worse yet, the cafeteria."
#ROBOTS
tpm_left_robor1:0 "The Chief's Annoyance"
tpm_left_robor1_desc:0 "Some of the boys patrolling up the Mississippi have come home hauling heaps of scrap from an abandoned RobCo facility decaying along the shores. Among them were semi-functional hunks of junk programmed with a seemingly bottomless pit of old laws and directives all too eager to spout... incessantly... into the early hours of the morning..."

tpm_left_robor2:0 "The Chief's Tolerance"
tpm_left_robor2_desc:0 "The fun-sized bots, also known as the newfound bane of the Chief’s existence, have reportedly served as an adequate base to reverse-engineer some apparently rather rare components. For that, they have just about delayed a therapeutic beating by a few months."

tpm_left_robor3:0 "The Chief's Acceptance"
tpm_left_robor3_desc:0 "The boys have made an astounding breakthrough, pinning down the bots' voice boxes and surgically removing them, to be preserved on the Chief’s desk as a cautionary tale. As a minor bonus, the eggheads reckon they’ve garnered enough of an understanding of their components to both replicate and upgrade existing enforcer functionalities. All’s well that ends well... eventually."

#CLANKERS
tpm_left_funding_clankers1:0 "Frontier Justice on Wheels"
tpm_left_funding_clankers1_desc:0 "Kron “Coolant” Rodriguez is a handyman first, a biker second and a patrolman last. He heads out on duty when he feels like it and attends meetings maybe once a month to complain about equipment rationing. And yet, his results speak for themselves. The Chief wants to capitalise on this potentially fat vein, offering Coolant a generous promotion – and bonus – with the hopes of formalising a proper motorised wing."

tpm_left_funding_clankers2:0 "Clanker Huts"
tpm_left_funding_clankers2_desc:0 "How can we hope to deliver justice on wheels when we don’t got the assets? With Moss Bluff becoming a hodge podge of odds and ends these days, a couple dedicated manufacturing plants won’t look too out of place."

tpm_left_funding_clankers3:0 "A Healthy Mind"
tpm_left_funding_clankers3_desc:0 "Between some of Coolant’s tipoffs on fuel conservation and general mechanical knowhow, the boys down in the workshops were able to work out wonders with nothing but a handful of scraps and rusty tools."

tpm_left_funding_clankers4:0 "Ready For Anything"
tpm_left_funding_clankers4_desc:0 "By scrounging together some old synthetic rubbers found in the depths of an abandoned Lafayette warehouse, we were able to reinforce the tyring on some of the heavier vehicles churned out in recent months. Should make off-roading easier if nothing else..."

tpm_left_the_best_little_garage:0 "The Best Little Garage"
tpm_left_the_best_little_garage_desc:0 "They say it’s easier to get richer the more loaded you are. A sound notion when it comes to cold, hard cash just as much as knowhow. As these top-of-the-line babies roar through the bayou, the ruffians of Louisiana will learn to fear us."

tpm_left_funding_clankers_offshoot:0 "Bearing Fruits"
tpm_left_funding_clankers_offshoot_desc:0 "It took a bit of elbow grease, but Coolant has finally come through, sharing a surprisingly extensive swath of streets smarts with the rest of the boys from the newly refurbished Lafayette town garage. Although the Chief’s gotta wonder how many are flocking to be lectured about engine tuning as opposed to gawking at the meticously preserved pinup posters..."

##RIGHT
tpm_right_generic_opening:0 "Life in Transition"
tpm_right_generic_opening_desc:0 "In the decades following the Great War, settling in a sleepy town of folks minding their own business was the best your average Joe could hope for.  That ain’t the case no more. These days, you’re dealing with federal governments, organised armies of freaks, and sprawling tribes specialising in a dozen different ways to kill. Either we find our own voice, or get left in the dust."
#OPENING UP LAFAYETTE
tpm_right_oepning_up_lafayette:0 "Opening Up Lafayette"
tpm_right_oepning_up_lafayette_desc:0 "These days, the ol’ Lone Star State is a stew of crooks, pimps and bandits – but merchants, businessmen and honest, red-blooded working Americans all the same.  When all is said ‘n done, opening up the gates a little can’t do us more harm than good - right?"

tpm_right_taking_refuge:0 "The Right to Refuge"
tpm_right_taking_refuge_desc:0 "Even with the drawbridge ever so slightly lowered, we’ve already got all sorts of folks clinging on the end, from refugees from the West and down South to the yuppies and loan sharks of Houston smelling profit. We ain’t about to hold up our nose to their perseverance."

tpm_right_refuge_SUF:0 "Great Minds Think Alike"
tpm_right_refuge_SUF_desc:0 "The Chief’s quite fond of some of the newest arrivals from Fort Summer. Tenacious, hard bastards they are, with the right spirit to boot. They’ll fit right in – and hopefully so will their working-age relatives."

tpm_right_refuge_LOS-CBN:0 "The Lost Lincoln League"
tpm_right_refuge_LOS-CBN_desc:0 "When looking at Los and Carbon, we can hardly complain about being squeezed on all sides ourselves. Strange folks they may be, we can’t turn a blind eye to them, not after what happened with their settlements – even if that means takin' in some, uh, choice characters."

tpm_right_refuge_PEC:0 "Home on the Range"
tpm_right_refuge_PEC_desc:0 "Tough, independent, and twice as smart as he could ever hope to be – Sheila Bowen is the Chief’s type alright. Tragically, date proposals had to be left on the cutting room floor in order to secure a sound trade deal with the ranchers of Pecos. And to think he'd slicked his hair for the occasion too..."

tpm_right_refuge_BOS:0 "They're Not All Bad"
tpm_right_refuge_BOS_desc:0 "Regardless of how we feel about the Texan Brotherhood, one thing remains a constant: We ain't too bigga fans of the hardliners. Obessed with their doctrines and exclusivity, the members leaning towards the old ways have never really melded well with us. However, recently a couple of them decided to bail, seemingly fed up with the affairs around Dallas. We're confident they'll adjust in time."

tpm_right_refuge_MOB:0 "Witness Protection"
tpm_right_refuge_MOB_desc:0 "Even with Rusk and his pals’ finger on the pulse, crime continues to run rampant across Texas, concerned eyewitnesses fearing for their lives as they tumble down the depths of TEU bureaucracy and paperwork. All they need is someone to watch over ‘em, be the heroes they need – well, here we are."

tpm_right_refuge_TUB:0 "The Show Must Go On"
tpm_right_refuge_TUB_desc:0 "Mr. Entertainment’s digs might be down in the dumps, but that don’t mean he’s without use. Over the years, XVIII Station has become a veritable cache of old world knickknacks, safely stored in an underground stash known only to the DJ himself. He’s happy to relinquish these in exchange for refuge for his followers as well as a halfway decent flat in the middle of town."

tpm_right_refuge_ASS:0 "Raiders of Circumstance"
tpm_right_refuge_ASS_desc:0 "Ah, they ain’t all bad when they don’t got to scrounge for food to get by. Let’s have ‘em hand over them funky-looking roller-skates and we can bury the axe... though some volunteering down at the stadium couldn't hurt community spirit."

tpm_right_refuge_CAR:0 "Hell's Kitchen"
tpm_right_refuge_CAR_desc:0 "The Carthaginians are quite the weird bunch. One group of savage raiders hellbent on eating their comrades, another bunch just wanting to barbecue in peace. 'Seems a third party went and took care of the former, and now a couple  of chefs have wandered on into Lafayette. Who are we to turn down free food?"

#ACTUAL INDUSTRY
tpm_right_actual_industry:0 "Rolling Up Our Sleeves"
tpm_right_actual_industry_desc:0 "Having been under the thumb of raiders and gangbangers for years, it’s little wonder that Moss Bluff has remained a backwater dump amid a sea of slightly more accessible dumps. But hey-ho; ‘least we’ve got a clean slate."

tpm_right_research_slot:0 "Banging Our Noggins Together"
tpm_right_research_slot_desc:0 "Well, maybe not that much of a backwater after all! On the outskirts of Moss Bluff was found an ol’ research complex left weirdly untouched by the raider folk and the handful of settlers alike. Old World equipment up the wazoo – enough to get some of the boys to knuckle down on some overdue homework."

tpm_right_hitting_fusion_cores_really_hard:0 "Hitting Fusion Cores Really Hard"
tpm_right_hitting_fusion_cores_really_hard_desc:0 "Due to the use of robotic deputies before the war, the Lafayette Police Department was absolutely filled with fusion cores. In these quieter times and with more time on their hands, some of the officers have kunckled down to make an inventory, recycle the malfunctioning components and test out the healthier batches. By the end of that rigmarole, we was left with a dang good haul."

tpm_right_we_dont_need_all_these_things:0 "We Dont Really Need All These Things"
tpm_right_we_dont_need_all_these_things_desc:0 "Right, we are quite literally swimming in fusion cores, to the extent that the storage unit back at HQ is overflowing. Hopefully we won’t be looking back at this investment with tears in our eyes when the rainy season comes around… and goddamn does it pour it here sometimes."

tpm_right_bending_the_bluff:0 "Bending the Bluff"
tpm_right_bending_the_bluff_desc:0 "End of the day, chow ‘s the beating heart of any society. And for that society to grow big and strong, the arteries have to follow suit."

tpm_right_unusually_popular_tatos:0 "Unusally Popular Tatos"
tpm_right_unusually_popular_tatos_desc:0 "In most cases, people tend to despise tatos. They often have the consistency of a brick and taste like wet, acidic cardboard. The only reason people bother growing them is because they crop up just about everywhere and require minimal effort to farm. Turns out a hearty side of gulf rad-tuna's all you need to make em pop."

tpm_right_we_are_set:0 "Spick and Span"
tpm_right_we_are_set_desc:0 "With power flowing like never before and the crop yields stretching beyond the horizon, Lafayette’s become a true beacon of the bayou. Now if only all the giant moths could piss off back to New Orleans..."

tpm_right_industryb:0 "Keep Cracking at this Farming Thing"
tpm_right_industryb_desc:0 "The folks of Lafayette have settled into this whole farming racket surprisingly snug for being largely a band of junkers and scrappers. Is mass-scale tato farming really what the future holds? God help us all..."

tpm_right_industryc:0 "Stronger Together"
tpm_right_industryc_desc:0 "Lafeyette can never fully proposer if the neighbouring settlements lag behind. The Chief reckons that a charitable donation is in order."
