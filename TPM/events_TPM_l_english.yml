    nf_tpm.1.t:0 "Why Here?"
    nf_tpm.1.d:0 "The lights were off in the Patrol Chief's office. Then the door squeaked open, a hand reached in, and the lights turned on. The chief opened the door fully, took two steps inside, hesitated, turned the lights back off, and closed the door. Then he staggered over to the hideaway bed he'd forgotten to hide away that morning and flopped face-first onto the thing. After a minute or so, he summoned the energy to pull himself full onto the bed, sinking his face into the pillow and groaning. He had a headache and he knew he wouldn't be able to sleep for a bit, but he'd still give it an fair shot. That effort was rather rudely interrupted when the chief felt something wet and scratchy stroking the edge of his left pinky finger."

    nf_tpm_events_continued.1.d:0 ""§o'Oh, come on, Callahan,'§!" the chief mimicked the cat saying, "§o'you can't go to bed yet, I need my food.'§! Heh, lil rascal." The chief sighed and waited another minute until the cat started impatiently pawing at his face. "Alright, alright. I'm awake." He sat up and paused for a moment to pet the old fart, then he stood up. He wandered back over to the office's light switch and flicked it back on again. Then he went over to the kitchenette the office came with and opened one of its cupboards. He pulled out a small can labelled "Bayou Beach Snapper" and dumped its contents into a bowl. He set it on the ground and waited. "Look, kitty, I can stand 'ere all night. You comin'?" After a moment of standing pompously on the edge of the bed, Sullivan III jumped down and strutted to his food, where he indignantly poked it a few times before eating it. The chief shook his head and sighed, then walked over to the fridge.\n\nHe stopped and stared at some of the pictures taped onto its time-stained surface. The one that always caught his eye was the flashy one at eye-level. A bright mushroom cloud rising over a city. He turned back to face the cat. "I ever tell you 'bout the time this city got bombed?" He had done so many times, of course. "Well, we still ain't sure what they had 'gainst Lafayette that made 'em so eager to blow the place to kingdom come, but it only took one big'un. Seems kinda pointless, if you ask me." He turned back to the fridge and opened it, pulling the last beer from the bottom row. He inspected the label just to make sure it was the right brand, then he closed the fridge and walked back towards his bed. "They were mighty stupid back then. So much death.""

    nf_tpm.2.d:0 "Sullivan III didn't pay the Patrol Chief any attention. "Well, what's this, now?" The chief had been pacing around the office when he noticed a binder sitting on his desk he didn't recognize. "What could you be...?" He gave Sully a glance—still eating his chopped-up fish—and sat down in his creaky chair. He took a moment to pry the cap from his beer. Then he paused, staring at it for a moment, pondering how strange it was that they'd strap a currency atop something so simple as a bottle of beer. He put the cap down and took a sip of the beer. He coughed lightly and chuckled. "Heh. Disgusting." He shook his head and took another sip before reaching for the mysterious binder. It was a normal, white, pre-war paper binder. There was a note in the front.\n \n §R"Sorry it took so long for me to get you this. I know your father wanted you to have it once you took over the Patrol back in '55, but to be frank, I just forgot."§!"

    nf_tpm_events_continued.2.d:0 "Callahan's eyebrows went up when he read the signed name. "Hey, uh, Sully. D'you see Franklin come in earlier?" He looked just in time to see Sully give him the feline facial equivalent of the middle finger. "Guess you must've been asleep," the chief muttered. He turned the binder over. There was nothing special about the back. He took another sip of his delightfully rancid beer and opened the binder to its first page. There was a sealed envelope labelled "Adam." The chief recognized it as his father's handwriting. "Man, I'm too tired for this." He pulled the letter from its sleeve and put it in the desk's top right-hand drawer. "I'll get back to you, dad. Gimme a bit."\n\nHe flipped the binder to the next sleeve and saw some pictures he recognized. Photographs of the first settlers picking through the rubble of downtown Lafayette nearly 50 years after the bombs dropped were a sight any citizen of the good city would recognize, and the chief could've sworn he'd seen these specific pictures somewhere when he was younger. "Those men knew how to take something bad and make it better," the chief told himself. "Wish I knew how they did it." Sullivan made a clinking noise, and the chief looked over. There was still fish in the bowl. Must've been the big guy's collar bumping against the bowl. "Y'know what those fine folks did, Sully?" He smiled, and the cat looked up for a moment. "They were smarter than I am." The cat sneezed and returned to its food."
    nf_tpm_events_continued.2.a:0 ""They built back what they remembered.""

    nf_tpm.3.t:0 "It Had to Happen Eventually"
    nf_tpm.3.d:0 "The chief spent the next few minutes flipping through the clear sleeves and looseleaf papers that made up the contents of the binder. There was a lot to go through, and he hadn't expected to get so caught up in it. The first few sleeves were filled with a handful of other pictures from the earlier post-war history of Lafayette. Some of them seemed happily familiar, and one picture of some settlers shaking hands with a small group of ghoulish traders struck the chief as having been on proud display in his father's office. The next few pages were transcripts from various meetings regarding the formation of the Patrolmen peacekeeper organization. The chief smiled when he saw one he recognized, and he stood up.\n\nSullivan had finished his fish and was staring into the bowl, clearly unable to understand that there was no more food inside it. "Hey, Sully, I think you're done there." The cat looked up at the chief, gave a sour look, and wandered back over to the hideaway bed. His majesty jumped up and immediately flopped sideways, fat and happy. The chief wandered to the other side of the room and opened a cabinet, pulling out a small box of old cassettes. He fingered through their spines until he found one with the right label, and he pushed it into the cassette player on top of the cabinet."

    nf_tpm_events_continued.3.d:0 "\"Well, we've gotta do somethin' about it! I mean, have you heard some'a the stories outa Texas? Cannibals! Like, the typa people that eat other people! We just gonna sit 'ere and do nothin' about it?"\n\n"It's not our fight! This is only the first time we've had a run-in with bandits since we rebuilt this city, and—I mean, come on. Texas is a big place with its own problems. You want us to go try and conquer the entire region just to slaughter some people doin' disgusting things?"\n\n"Nah, but we've gotta stand up for ourselves! Somehow. I dunno, maybe..."\n\n"How 'bout this. We've never needed cops, but a handful of sheriffs and deputies to patrol outside the city's limits couldn't hurt. Why don't you start some sorta patrol group to do that, like a town watch?"\n\nThe chief smiled as the recording played out. The Lafayette Patrolmen had always been a casual people's response to a deadly serious issue. He thought briefly about the raid on Lafayette that inspired that all-important meeting, and of how the average citizen went out of their ways to take up ancient arms to defend their homes without anyone having to tell them to do so. Sullivan meowed grumpily from the bed, pulling the chief away from his thoughts."

    nf_tpm.4.t:0 "Noble Beginnings"
    nf_tpm.4.d:0 "The chief sat back and kept listening to the cassette tape recording of the fateful Lafayette City Hall meeting that formed the organization his family would grow to head. When it finally ended and the cassette clicked out of its spot, the chief closed his eyes and let out a deep exhale. "Y'know, Sully. I wish you'd understand what a pickle I'm in. It'd sure help knowin' you'd know." He opened his eyes again and sat up straight. He glanced over to his bed to see Sullivan III hadn't even bothered to look the chief's way. "Alright, keep to yourself, then."\n\nThe chief grinned a bit. Then he remembered the envelope in his desk's drawer and his grin fell away. He waited for a moment, glanced around himself for no reason in particular, and pulled the drawer open. He gingerly removed the letter and opened it with as much care as he'd given his revolver that morning during its weekly inspection and cleaning.  He pulled it out and saw it was a generic pre-war birthday card."
    nf_tpm.4.a:0 "§gThere was a small, firm card inside.§!"

    nf_tpm_events_continued.4.t:0 "Noble Beginnings, Continued"
    nf_tpm_events_continued.4.d:0 "He opened it and immediately broke back into a smile. "Since you're not quite making bread just yet, here's a little dough to get you started!" An old American two dollar bill slid out of the card. Callahan's grandad always used to make jokes about those bills and how pointless they were, not that anyone cared. The chief set the bill aside and read the brief message inscribed under the cheesy built-in text.\n\n§B"Happy Birthday, Adam! If you're seeing this, I probably didn't make it out of that last op, and Franklin's probably the one that handed you this card. Bit of bad luck, that, but hopefully my death bought the patrol some much-needed time. There's some issues with bribes and stuff that've been going on, and you'll need every bit of time you can get to sort all that out. Still, I've recommended you to take over the Patrol, and I've got no doubts that you'll do an excellent job. You know your mom and I always loved you, and we believe in you. Make me proud, son. - Dad"§!\n\nThe chief felt tears starting to form at his eyes. He carefully put the card back in its envelope and put that back in the binder. He closed the binder, stood up, and picked up the two dollar bill. He stopped to think for a moment, then he walked over to the coat rack by the door. He picked his brown Patrol Chief's hat from the rack and tucked the bill inside its inner ridge, just out of view. He put the hat back in its place, then he walked over to his bed, grabbing his beer on the way. Then he laid down next to Sullivan and spent the next half an hour stroking, and the cat purred appreciatively the entire time."

    nf_tpm_act1.1.d:0 ""Alrighty, well, thank y'all again for comin' out tonight, and let's have a good time. S'mores ingredients are over by the grill somewhere off yonder, we got plenty'a firewood by the fence ova'there, and you've just gotta find y'all's leads to know which fire's yours. Enjoy!" The crowd of blue hats gave a brief applause before dispersing. Most of the boys split up and found their patrol leads by the fires spread around the Lafayette City Memorial Park, a few wandered aimlessly chatting with friends from other patrols, and a small cluster gathered by the grill to pick up their crackers and marshmallows. Callahan wandered over and pulled up a lawn chair alongside the campfire of 5th Patrol, Grenham's Guardians.\n\n"Heya, chief! You gonna join your old boys for a few stories?" Callahan flashed a smile at patrol lead Grenham. "Yeah, it's been a while since I've checked up on the fifth. Figured it'd be a nice way to see some of y'all again by hearin' the stories y'all've got to tell." He did a quick sweep around the campfire and gave a polite tip of the hat to any of the older lawmen he used to lead on patrols personally back when he'd been in charge of the 5th Patrol, Callahan's Clankers. "Who we waitin' on?"\n\n"That'd be me," a new patrol boy chimed up. His arms were full of various bags and ingredients, and he distributed the s'mores materials with as much haste as he could manage."

    nf_tpm_events_continued.5.d:0 ""Alright, maybe I'll start us off." Grenham leaned forward and waited for any objections. None came, and the chief closed his eyes to listen. "Well, this one's gonna be short, just 'cause I wasn't there for most of the fight, but y'all remember one certain Cap'n Crinkle?" A light round of laughs and nods went around the campfire. "Well, for the newbies with us, he's one'a them Texan muties. Came down from out west a good few years before that Attis guy showed up, and he put together a crew'a pirates. Just back in '63, he made a raid on the Cannery down south. Guess he just wanted some fish or somethin'." Light chuckles.\n\n"Well, the fifth got called down to help hold 'em off while the rest'a the patrol figgered somethin' else out, but we teamed up with the Cannery's guns and sent 'em packin'. The big chief led us in, and he got the daylights knocked out of 'em by an unlucky club to the 'ead just a minute into the battle, but the rest of us got 'em outa there and sent the muties packin'. Reagan—who here remembers Reagan?" A few folks raised their hands. "Reagan snuck away in the bastard's hold and blew up a big chunk'a dynamite before swimmin' back to shore. We don't think the bastards sunk, but we haven't seen 'em since, and we doubt we'll see 'em again." Grenham leaned back while he received a polite amount of applause from the rest of his squad. Someone's marshmellow fell off its stick and into the fire, earning a round of "ooh"s from the rest of the patrol."

    nf_tpm_act1.2.d:0 "Chief Callahan noticed the sun was no longer in the sky, and the fires were starting to be the main source of light in the park. Grenham looked around the campfire. "So, uh, who's next? Don't make me call on y'all." After a dozen seconds of hesitant silence and awkward glances, one of the older members of the patrol spoke up. "Alright, lemme show you young'uns how it's done. How many'a y'all remember the battle of Alexandria back in '43?" Three of the older members raised their hands, including Grenham.\nThe chief opened his eyes and sat up for a moment. "I heard the old chief's stories 'bout that battle. But I don't think I ever heard a perspective from on the ground. You were there?"\n\nCallahan nodded and leaned back again, though he kept his eyes open and stared at the emerging stars. "Back in '43, there was a guy named Kruger who joined the patrol. Came over from Texas and claimed to have been a part of the Texan Rangers, back when they were a thing. He was a good marksman and he seemed to want to settle down, so the old chief let 'em in. Turns out he wasn't only not from Texas, he had a contract with that old bandit leader Reanolds Claw up in Alexandria. Well, I'm sure you know the history so I'll skip the details, but this Kruger fella had been the one organizin' kidnappins in broad daylight in Lafayette, and when his cover got blown—by yours truly, of course—he shot two of our nicest guys dead on the spot and headed back on up to Alexandria. We mustered the patrol and followed 'em there. Fightin' in the swamp wasn't easy, and depite most of the Gator Gang bein' away on 'business,' the few guardin' the town put up a good fight.""

Buggers would find a muddy spot next to a buildin' they knew'd be searched soon, then they'd cover 'emselves in mud and lay down. When any'a our patrols walked up, they'd sit up and blast 'em then and there. Lost the entirety of the 7th Patrol to that stupid trick before we learned. But once the old chief got wind of the plan, he got news out to the boys fast enough, and we lit up any mud pile lookin' bigger than a folded bodybag."\n\nHe paused again, and a cloud rolled over one of the stars Callahan had been watching. "Well, in the end we found the folks they'd kidnapped. Most were still alive, but a few'd been shipped off to who knows where by that point. Rumor's still around they ended up in cannibal lands, but we don't know for sure." He ended on the solemn note. Grenham leaned forward and piped up with a smile. "But hoo boy, did we get a lotta loot outa that raid before the bandits showed up again!" That seemed to reset the mood, and some people got up to go get more marshmallows."

    nf_tpm_act1.3.d:0 "Patrol lead Grenham's eyes narrowed as he glanced around the crackling campfire. After a minute or so he locked eyes with Lead Sheriff George, arguably the oldest man in the 5th Patrol. George met the man's stare, smiled, and laughed. "Ha, alright, alright. You've been askin' long enough. I suppose you want the Battle O' Libercity?" Grenham shrugged innocently. "No idea what you're talkin' about, Gregory, but if that's the story you're gonna tell... Well, don't let me stop you."\n\nCallahan continued staring up at the stars. It was completely dark out, and he had a bit of trouble seeing the more distant twinkles through his shades, but that didn't particularly bother him. "Alright, we'll start at the beginnin'. Y'all know how Texas used to be a much nastier place that it is now, right? Cannibal culture ran rampant over there for about a century, startin' up about the time our ancestors finally resettled the heart'a Lafayette."\n\nHe paused to take a breath:"Well, since Attis's muties and the Brotherhood chasin' them showed up, the cannibals just can't seem to catch a break. They're still around in a few places down south, but that's only 'cause we showed 'em how the lay'a the land was back at Libercity. Spring of '39 and I was a newbie on the force. This was back in the days of the 9th Patrolmen, before the Orleans Affair brought on the 10th that our new chief's headin' these days.""

But credit where credit's due, there's some good folks livin' over there, and that made 'em a prime target for a cannibal rebellion. See, with the Brotherhood slowly pushin' the cannibals back in north Texas and with the muties too busy mutatin' and slaughterin' any humans they found in the south, there wasn't much room left for the cannibals to go raidin' in. We got a message sent by short-range radio of all things, and this Callahan's grandaddy led us on over to help them folks out. To be honest, there ain't much of a story to tell. We showed up on the outskirts'a town, surrounded the place in secret, then the old chief went in alone to talk to 'em. He told 'em we'd got 'em all surrounded and they could piss off or fight, and they chose the latter." The men grinned.\n\n"Pretty sure the chief expected to get shot then and there, but the cannibals let 'em return to our lines regardless. Maybe they thought 'e was bluffin'. Anywho, all I did in that fight was clear a two-story 'otel, and there was only one cannibal smokin' in the lobby who surrendered when we caught 'em. We rounded up the survivors of the cannibals and the townsfolk, asked 'em all who'd been seen eatin' people and who'd just been along for the ride, we strung up any of 'em who'd been seen chompin' on some poor man's liver, and the rest we disarmed, branded, and let go. Then we returned home; didn't even ask for payment. It was a good time for all." Grenham started the applause and smiled wide. "Well, we sure showed 'em even back then!

"Alright, I'll tell the only one worth tellin', and I'll let y'all make yer own judgements on who I am after the tale."\n\nHe rose: "Who here's heard how my old man met his maker?" Unlike so many other casual remarks made throughout the night, the chief's comment was only met with solemn silence. "Alright, I'll take that as mild approval. 'Bout two decades back my old man got word that some bandits outa New Orleans had been responsible for a particularly nasty bit'a battle over in the Bluff, and he decided we'd need to take 'em out where they came from. I was only twenty years of age, but I was leadin' the 5th Patrol back then, and we'd been given vanguard duty. 'Parently some mobsters over in Orleans caught wind of our plans—probly through a mole or somethin', though we never did figger out how—but they made a nice ambush for us.

The old Chief Callahan and the 1st Patrol rode up behind the mobsters on some'a them silent bikes we got for special business, and we ambushed the ambushers. But, uh..." The chief paused and adjusted his shades. "Well, it wasn't a flawless victory. We went over the bodies and found between the ambushers and a few other battles close by with similar results that we'd killed just 'bout everyone we'd come for without even settin' foot in Orleans itself. Maybe the mobsters knew to throw away some'a the men we wanted most just to keep us from bein' a real threat; I've thought about that quite a bit. But my old man got shot in the stomach durin' the rescue, and he bled out waitin' on his wife to come by with the stimpaks. But he didn't know she's already been killed in another ambush 'bout an hour before his battle happened."\n\nCallahan paused and sniffed. The rest of the 5th respectfully held their silence. "Well, I was by his side when he went on to the Lord's land. He told me to take good care'a my mom, and 'e told me to make 'em proud. Told me I'd save our good city someday." Callahan laughed a little and looked back towards the sky. "Blubberin' fool that I was, I kept tellin' him he'd be alright 'till the second he passed. Didn't even realize how much energy it must'a cost 'em to say 'I love you' at the very end." The boys nodded, and when the chief leaned back in his chair again, they all gave a respectable round of applause. The chief looked up and noticed some other eavesdroppers wandering away who must've been listening. "Serves 'em right," the chief muttered to himself."

"I'm guessin' y'all have had suspicions 'bout why I called y'all in for such a formal meetin'." The dozen patrol lead members took their seats. All but Old Man Franklin reached for one of the glazed donuts in a bowl that got casually passed around the table. "What, we gettin' a raise?" one of the newer members joked. Most of the men at the table laughed.\n\n"Well, uh, not exactly. Kinda the opposite, really." That got their attention. "See, I've been hearin' some troublin' rumors from y'all's subordinates, and a few do-gooders among the newbies to the Patrol asked me to check some things out." Callahan pulled up his chair at the head of the conference table and sat down. "Donut?" The tension loosened slightly as one of the patrol leads slid the nearly-empty plastic bowl across the table. Callahan reached in and plucked the slightly-less-shriveled of the two remaining donuts from its basin. "Franklin, not hungry?" The old man at the other end of the table shook his head and raised his right hand apologetically. "Well, more for me." He took a moment to chew and noted the donuts that morning were just a little too sugary for his tastes."

We—mmm—we've been meeting our quotas, the boys are happy, and we've been making more money than ever before. What's the issue?"\n\nCallahan's brow raised, and he lowered his sunglasses for dramatic effect. It was chief's policy to wear the uniform's shades at all times, after all, so even a brief sighting of the chief's emerald eyes was to be taken as either a great compliment or a source of great concern. The chief intended the latter. "That's part'a the problem. See, we've always gotten our fundin' from the good people of this good city, but I've been gettin' reports y'all have been takin' more than we've really needed. All we need's enough caps for food and guns, seein' as how we've got no issues with water an'the patrol barrack's enough sleepin' space for the whole patrol."\n\nThe chief glanced back and forth, noting which leads had looks bordering on guilt and which ones kept the pokerface. They'd all been doing it, he knew—even old Franklin. "But that's just the start of it, and I've let it all go on too long. Figured it's about time I set some people to fixin' some problems.

The lights were turned a cozy low, and the chief admittedly had a slight bit of difficulty making out some of the more haggard faces from beneath the shades that tradition demanded he keep mounted astride his face at all times.\n\n"Hey, Johnny!" "Howdy, chief!" The bartender waved back as Callahan walked up to the wooden bar that spanned the length of the back wall. The chief took a seat, gave the bartender a sideways glance, and the bartender nodded. He pulled one of the many glasses from the wall shelves behind the bar and rapidly filled it to the brim with a tap beer brought in from New Orleans. "Long day?""

Johnny looked up from the glasses he'd been dusting off and gave the chief a knowing smile. "Can't say I'm much surprised, boss."\n\nCallahan looked over. "Now wotchu mean by that?" Johnny laughed. "Well, what I mean by that's gotta do with the monthly fees I've been payin' your boys just to keep the place clean." He nodded towards the small crew of Patrolmen newbies drinking in the far corner of the bar. "See those boys? They're here to keep the peace and I pay 'em in beer and caps. Problem is, sometimes they're the ones who need the peace kept from. See what I'm gettin' at?"\n\n"Jeez, that ain't right." The chief took another long sip. "How long's it been like this?" "They've been chargin' about as much as the beer costs for a year or so now, but off and on crews like 'em have been goin' 'round makin' similar bargains since your daddy's day." Callahan gave the boys at the other end of the bar a long look. Eventually they awkwardly waved, and the chief awkwardly waved back. "Look, I'm gonna get to the bottom of all this. Somethin's gotta change. We're here to protect y'all by patrollin', not by loungin' about drinkin' y'all's beer. Gimme some time and I'll see what I can do." "'Preciate it, chief." Callahan finished his drink, plopped a trio of bottle caps on the bar, and left the building the same way he'd come in."

"Hey there, welcome to Dynamite Danny's, what can I get for you...?" The chief looked around at the various locked containers and sealed crates that littered the floor of the shop. Some had various Spanish markings that indicated probable origin from the Caribbean or Mexican dealers Danny was connected with, but the vast majority of his stock had always been and would likely always remain direct imports from the Texan industrial powers and the illicit gunsmiths of New Orleans."

"Well, well, well, if it ain't the chief. Been a minute since I've seen you 'round these parts'a town. What, your daddy's pistol jam again?" Callahan chuckled. "Nah, but I've got a lotta stuff that is jammed beyond repair. Seems the boys just never bothered tellin' me 'bout it and now I'm sittin' 'ere holdin' the bag." The chief walked up to the counter while Danny set his antique revolver and cleaning tools to the side. "I've got a bit of a proposition for ya, Danny. Been hearin' a lotta crap from some of my boys." Danny lowered his eyebrows. "Nothin' too bad about me, I hope." "Nah, you're in the clear. It's the boys I've been gettin' worried about. Quick question. How much they been chargin' you for protection over the last couple years?" Danny's face scrunched up a little and he did some mental math. "I... I can't say for sure. Changes each year. I remember it was just the twenty cap fee everyone pays back in your father's day, but these days I'm doin' a hundred a month. Tried turnin' 'em away once and a shipment went missin' without a trace. Figured I'd better pay up after that one."\n\nThe chief whistled a note of surprise. "Well, lookie here. I've gotta replace some of our crap gear that nobody's told me was crap 'till just recently. If you can exchange our broken stuff for some newer stuff, I'll make sure the boys don't give you any trouble for the next couple years, and it'll be back to the 20 cap fee after that." He extended his hand across the counter for Danny to shake. The dealer looked at it skeptically. "Look, I'm mighty sorry I let things get this bad. Honest truth, I didn't know. I'm tryin' my best and I'm makin' offers like these all over town." Danny waited for another moment, then grunted and shook the chief's hand. "Well, I'd better know what you're lookin' to do so I can get you wotchu need." The chief lowered his shades and grinned."

After about ten minutes of this back and forth game only one of the three players knew they were playing, one of them finally grew a pair and knocked. "Hey, uh, chief? You in?" "Yup! Come on in, boys."\n\nThe door opened slowly and a pair of young men walked in. "Take a seat, if you please." A pair of chairs had been set out in front of the chief's desk, and the two sat down. The tall patrolman with the bright orange puff of facial hair took the chair on the chief's left, and the shorter patrolman with the acne-ridden face took the chair on the chief's right. "You, uh... You wanted to speak with us, sir?" "Yes indeedy.

The chief looked back and forth at the increasingly-sweating pair before continuing with a closed smile. "Well, one'a the issues this patrol's been facin' lately comes down to a lack'a public trust. And that one really comes down to the boys askin' for more money than our patrollin' needs. Now, Tim, I been hearin' some stuff 'bout how you convinced the boys over at Delano's by the Bluff that his humble restaurant warranted a fee of upwards of a few hundred a month just for protection from the same bandits that other restaurants in Lafayette pay the standard twenty a month for. Now, why is that?"\n\nThe chief raised his hand as Tim opened his mouth: "Question was rhetorical; no need to answer. What's important is it ain't right and I'm sick of it." The chief turned to Kim, who was still waiting for his turn to be cowed. "I'll keep this brief, since I know the both of you's probably already paid in guilt enough over this, since I think the both of y'all are still good, decent men beneath all the dirt. Did you, Kim LeSeur, shoot a surrenderin' bandit in the head and bury 'em in secret back in '72?" Kim remained silent, but his head dipped and he started shuddering. "That's about what I thought." The chief stood up and pressed his palms firmly down on the desk. Neither of the sitting patrolmen raised their eyes to meet his shade-obscured glare."

Unfortunately, hundreds more had to stand around outside with speakers set up to extend the chief's voice that far. And nobody had decided to check their guns at the door, since nobody else was doing it.\n\nCallahan gulped and leaned into the microphone. "Hey, y'all." A rapture of applause went up from the crowd and he wanted to shrivel away. "I, uh... I ain't good at public speakin', as some'a y'all may know, so I'm gonna keep this short." He paused and gave an awkward smile while the folks settled back into their chairs. He silently thanked God he was still wearing those shades. "Heh.

Just wanted to remind y'all that we're 'ere to protect folks, not to rob 'em. alright?" That point was met with little more than awkward stares and downward glances. "Alright, I'll take the silence as y'all understandin'. Thanks for that. Anywho, now, onto the big problem. I've been hearin' a rumor goin' around lately. Remember that Gator raid that got by us a month or two back? Kidnapped a few of our finest citizens from under our noses." That got an angry murmur going. "Well, one of our patrols got a report the other day claimin' he saw the very folks that we lost." Silence. "Down at the Cannery." Hopeful murmurs. "Wearin' chains and bein' ordered 'round at the point of a rifle." Outrage.\n\nThe city hall exploded into a cluster of shouts, and a couple of the nastiest looking lawmen fired shots into the overhead ceiling. "Oi, calm down, the lottaya! We've tried askin' the folks down at the Bayou about this, but they've sent us packin' every time we got near. So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go down there ourselves, every last one of us. And then we're gonna figure out what they've been doin' in that cannery of theirs." Supportive cheers. "And while we're at it, we're gonna head on back to Alexandria. That Gator Gang's been makin' fools out of us for too long." Callahan could feel the sweat rolling down every part of his skin that wasn't in direct contact with his clothes, but it was of some relief that the crowd seemed on his side. "Alright, settle down. Last point on our agenda. If we're gonna be takin' this patrol to war—and I do mean that, war—we're gonna need our outfit to be a bit better across the board. So, I'm gonna need some volunteers for a bit of a side-project. Any takers?" Every hand in the room shot skyward in unison."

After a minute or so of labored breathing, he got himself under control and opened his eyes again. Sullivan III had jumped off the never-hidden-away hideaway and wandered over, sitting just in front of Callahan. The cat meowed indignantly.\n\n"Hiya there, old man." Callahan smiled and slapped himself a couple times on the cheek before standing back up. "Right, let's get you some food." He went to the shelf and grabbed a can of fish. "That's funny." The logo on the can was the same, but it sported a new set of gold and blue-painted steel revolvers underneath the normal lettering."

The chief stroked the cat for a minute or so before wandering over to his desk. "Alright, let's see here..." He flipped through a handful of notes and letters that had been delivered over the last couple days since he'd left to go on patrol with the Fifth. "Letter from the orphanage—that was a nice funeral, actually..." He flipped another one over. "Huh, forgot it was my birthday a couple days back. Should've remembered that." Then he saw a letter with the twin-pistoled crest of the Texan Brotherhood stamped onto it.\n\n"Well, if that ain't the most curious thing." He opened it and read the note inside. He looked down at his hand afterwards and saw it was shaking. "Hey, uh, Sully..." The chief's voice wavered in his throat. "Apparently the Brotherhood's got their eyes on us. Don't suppose, you, uh..." The chief stood up and felt dizzy. "Don't suppose you'd know why they're interested in us? We're, uh... We ain't Texan. Why..." He stumbled over to his bed and laid down. His head span for another ten or so minutes, but he calmed down when Sullivan hopped up and positioned himself next to the chief's hand.

The wife of one Sergeant Sebastian Keith had hand-delivered a message to the patrol chief's office requesting they do everything possible to end the war.

He looked to be unarmed, but the chief didn't trust that judgement.\n\nThe second was a super mutant wearing blue overalls and a plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled up. He had a typical Texan cowboy hat, but it had a chip taken out of its side and he wore it with a notable tilt to the right. He had a combat knife slid into a hole in his overalls, among other loose knickknacks.\n\nThe third figure was an ordinary lady in jeans, a collared t-shirt, and the brown vest that currently dominated Lone Star's fashion as an exclusive byproduct of mayor Cho Bang's choice of dress. She walked with a bounce in her step and a set of silver chains dangling out of her left pocket, which probably meant she was either a wealthy caravaneer or generational business owner."

The mutant sat down, and the bench buckled a bit. The lady sat down and nothing changed. The Paladin gave the bench a funny look, looked around—evidently not seeing the chief, whose brows were rapidly climbing his face—and tried to sit down. The bench held for a few seconds, then cracked, then collapsed. Callahan sat up quickly when he noticed the lady go down between the mutant and the Paladin, but the trio got back up without issue and had a good laugh about it. The chief smiled and shook his head. Then he took another sip of his lemonade. A pair of off-duty Patrolmen wandered up to the laughing trio and started talking to them and pointing at the bench.\n\nAfter a minute or so of casual discussion, the Paladin handed a few caps to the Patrolmen. They looked around and saw the chief, giving him a casual salute before wandering off. He saluted them back. The three misfits looked over at the chief and waved. The chief waved back to them as well, smiling as he did so. He took another sip of his drink and leaned back in the bench. He closed his eyes, and eventually the three outsiders wandered over. They were nice folks, and they had a nice chat. They apologized for the bench, and the chief told them not to worry about it. Benches could be replaced. It was a bit harder to replace friends."

"Well, since we signed on with the whole Texas thing there's been a lotta talk about gettin' Lafayette a formal set'a laws. We could always keep it simple and just not change, and that system's worked well for us in the past, but maybe it's time to set down some formal legal stuff. Or we could just use the TEU's old system. Seemed to work well enough for them." Danny just laughed. "Chief, there's a reason nobody's political in this city. Things are good enough as is.

Gary peered around the tent and saw the rest of the 5th slowly forming up in the clearing. He whistled a note of surprise. "They can put theirs down, too." He turned and shouted back into the woods. "Come on out, boys!" To Callahan's surprise, the entire 3rd Patrol group emerged from the bushes laughing. "What the..." "Chief, I dunno how you stumbled on us by chance, but we've been tryin' out a new typa bandit trap. C'mere." He motioned to the tent Callahan heard the snores coming from. Gary opened the flap of the tent, revealing a portable speaker making the noises. "Francis cooked this thing up for us a couple weeks back. We've already got two groups'a bandits tryin' to steal from the center of our bait hideouts in the last couple days. Was gonna bring it up in the meetin' this weekend, but it seems y'all beat me to it."\n\nGary gave a wide, proud grin, which was not something he normally did. Callahan took his hat off and rubbed his forehead. "Well, I certainly wasn't expecting to see y'all 'ere today." He paused, then put his hat back on and smiled. "No biggie, though. Here, we got the 5th and the 3rd in one spot on a patrol day. We caught a couple'a deer on the way over, what say we have a barbecue and tell some stories?" Gary grunted. "Well, can't say I'm a fan of our trap goin' unused, but I am hungry. The boys'll like it." He paused. "Speakin'a stories, one'a my boys had a good idea. We've gotta lotta stories across the patrol. It'd make for a nice book if we put some of 'em down to paper and printed it out. Might help with recruitment too." Callahan nodded and considered the idea before his mind drifted back to the topic of food."

Everyone knew the Bar on Particle Row was one of the few establishments in Lafayette with working television, and the Tubeheads' channel was one of the few channels the played anything on it. "Hey, Johnny! Flip the channel, Mr. Entertainment's on!" The bartender looked annoyed and didn't stop cleaning his mugs. "Mr. Entertainment's always on, to some extent or another. Wotchu want, exactly?"\n\nThe two lead sheriffs stared directly at Johnny, which Callahan thought was an amusing sight from his place at one of the tables on the side of the room. Rockwell spoke up. "Johnny, I've known ya since you were born. I've never asked for a favor. Do me a favor and flip the channel."\nJohnny's eyebrows went up, and he shrugged. He put down his mug and reached for the TV's remote control. He flipped the channel and turned up the volume."

The headline §o"Texas Economic Union merges member nations into the Provisional Republic of Texas!"§! repeatedly crossed the bottom of the screen. Mr. Entertainment was in the middle of explaining some of the new policies of the Provisional Republic, starting by clarifying that the armies and borders of the new nation would be combining into one legal entity. A constitutional convention would happen soon after the Provisional Republic's formation, and the Texan Economic Union's new goal would be to facilitate international trade between Texas and other non-Texan member states, of whom the Lafayette Patrolmen organization would be their first major customer.\n\nWhen Mr. Entertainment finally flicked off after an hour or so of political briefing, Callahan leaned back in his chair and sighed. He'd been drinking with patrol leads Grenham, Mack, and Francis, but Francis left halfway through the speech and Mack had long since passed out on the table. Grenham, still mostly sober and conscious, spoke up. "So... I guess that makes sense." Callahan shrugged. "Yeah. When I was up in Dallas a few years back I saw just as many Texan flags as Brother'ood flags. Kinda weird, but I guess they've been workin' toward this for a while."

But there were a few civilians meandering back and forth, which was a refreshing sight. Callahan walked up to the microphone. "Well, uh, howdy, guys!" The crowd cheered. "Well, I know a few people made actual efforts to run for the new position of Lafayette City Mayor—honorable mention to Deputy Pulp over there with a solid five votes..." The chief motioned to the side of the stage where Deputy Pulp was sulking after the general voter turnout proved to be rather uninterested in his plans of glorious conquest. "But I'll be honest, it wasn't really a contest. The second-place winner was Patrol Lead Franklin over there, garnerin' a hundred and sixteen votes, and he didn't even run." The chief pointed to Old Man Franklin at the foot of the stage, and Franklin bowed low in a dramatic fashion.\n\nThe crowd laughed, and that encouraged the chief enough to crack a smile. "Well, outa the three and a half thousand votes that came in, a solid two and a half thousand of 'em were from guys in the Patrol, if that tells you anythin' 'bout the political participation in our fine city." More laughs. "Still. With about 95% of the vote, y'all have decided that you want me to be your mayor." The crowd let out a healthy roar of cheers and applauds. The chief felt nervous, and he felt his heart racing. His vision started to blur. But he remembered that morning, when he had gone down to Clarence's pet shop and purchased a baby kitten. Sullivan IV was waiting back in the patrol chief's office, and somehow, that knowledge eased his heart a bit."

The crowd let out noises of dismay and Franklin's eyes went wide at the base of the stage. "But if we're gonna do this right, the mayor's gotta have equal say over the Patrol as the Patrol Chief has, so it's only gonna be for a year or so until I can figure out where the limits oughta be."\n\nHe paused and stared at one of the overhead spotlights before turning back to the crowd. "And there ain't a chance on Earth I'm lettin' Franklin take my office." That got some laughs and lightened the mood a bit. "Thank y'all for showin' up to vote, and I'll see y'all in a few years when we do this again. Have a good night, y'all." Mayor Adam Callahan stepped down from the stage and wiped the sweat from his brow. He stuck around to shake some hands, but he left for home as soon as it could be managed.

The old man led the chief behind a small pile of trash and rotting food. He made a motion to the other lawmen in the alley to leave, and they promptly did so. "Found 'er like this. For what it's worth, none'a the boys have piped up sayin' it was them that did it. Seems most of 'em aren't quite proud'a what we did here."\n\nThe chief looked down, took his sunglasses off, folded them, and slid them into his pocket. "I thought I gave 'em orders."

Sobek's eyes were still open, with the rest of her face in an expression of relaxed rage. Adam softly closed the girl's eyes, being careful not to touch the hole in her forehead. "It's probably for the best, anywho. If we'd caught her, most'a the boys probably woulda wanted to string 'er up. I wouldn't've been able to stop 'em." The chief stood back up. "And even if I had been able to convince everyone to bring 'er home, the only family she'd've had would've been her aunt, and she's on death's bed anywho." "It wasn't your fault she ran away," Franklin spoke up. "From everythin' I could gather at the time, everyone at the orphanage always treated her nasty and she was the runt of a runty litter. Had a chip on 'er shoulder, I guess."\n\nAnother moment of silence. "Heh, for what it's worth, our girl from the good city'a Lafayette was just so good at what she did that even the bandits bowed before 'er. That's gotta count for somethin', right?" Callahan offered a sad smile while he put his shades back on. "Maybe. Maybe. But let's make sure she gets a proper burial back home where she belongs. Ain't no reason a lifetime'a bad should make us turn on one of our own. Prodigal daughter and all that.""Amen," Franklin finished. The pair walked out of the alley and orders were given. A week later, a funeral for a lost child would be held in the Lafayette city orphanage. It would be a nice thing, for the nice girl that should have been instead of the bandit queen that was."

"Well, given where you're sittin', I really don't think that's much up to you, Mr. Chaco. Still, my apologies for the table manners." He wiped his mouth and settled back in his chair. "Mayor Ship-Breaker, do you know why we attacked y'all?" The bearded mayor gave a rough grunt. "Best we can tell, you just wanted our fish. We haven't got the slightest clue, and we did nothing wrong." "Well, we got reports sayin' you folks were keepin' slaves, and that some'a those slaves were our people the Gator Gang kidnapped a while back."\n\nThe hardened mayor and his scrawny assistant turned to stare at each other. Then they started laughing. Eventually they reminded themselves that people had died in the Lafayette-Cannery conflict and that they really shouldn't be laughing about it so soon. "Look, Mr. Callahan,"the mayor spoke up, "if you're telling the truth with that claim, someone gave you bad intelligence. We wouldn't have a need for slaves even if we could get them without causing a rebellion among our own people. It's hard enough to find jobs for everyone when the only industry we really have to our name is fish. You know how they'd react if we started outsourcing cheap labor? There'd be riots in the streets and I'd be out of a job faster than you could tax a new business. I keep my job because everyone else needs a job, and my biggest job is giving jobs.""

Most of 'em got away, but we took these two captives. We take them outside every day to let them get some time in the sun. To be frank, we just haven't figured out what to do with them yet." Callahan scratched his moustache. "Well, that would explain one thing. But one more thing. We sent boys your way more than a few times to try and ask about our missin' folks. And every time they got near y'all's island they got rebuffed and sent packin'. What's the deal if you didn't even have 'em?"\n\nShip-Breaker almost smiled. "What, we just had a big pirate raid on us and you thought we'd be party to letting strangers on the island? Everyone in your patrol wears the same uniform and half of them look the same even up close. Can you blame us for keeping quiet to likely pirate spies?"\nCallahan stood and shook his head. "Well, this has just been the worst misunderstandin' I've seen in a long time. We'll look into y'all's story, o'course, but if it's true, I am more deeply sorry than you could understand for the whole mess. You'll understand if I don't just hand the Cannery back over to ya to save face with the boys, but I'm sure we can work somethin' out."

There were angry shouts, a thud or so, and then a quick knock at his office door. The shouts continued while he shouted "Come on in!" He'd gotten totally off-track and lost his train of math with the papers he was filling out, so he pushed them to the side and told himself he'd fix the issue later.\n\nThe door opened and two men staggered in, dragging a third man by both arms. Callahan recognized the third man as Deputy Jim Lopez, older brother of the Lopez Twins that had been rapidly rising in popularity among the Patrolmen. The 27-year-old deputy—who had evidently been handcuffed and slightly beaten up—got slammed down in the seat opposite the chief's desk and held there by the two other men, who were both sheriffs in the 6th Patrol group that Jim was a part of.

This paladin buys in with a hefty bet, and he gets his cards. He immediately got a two pair'a aces and threes after Jim kept raisin' on his pair'a kings." He gave Jim another squeeze. "Jim immediately draws his gun, points it at the paladin's head, asks if he was cheatin' the paladin looked freaked out and said no, and Jim shot 'em dead right then and there. We've been walkin' for the last day and a half to get 'em here." Callahan's mouth dried up. "This true?" He faced the other sheriff, who nodded gravely. "I'm tellin' ya," Jim shouted again, "that tin can bastard was cheatin'! There's no way he coulda had two aces; I saw Leon's hand! He only got what he 'ad comin' to 'em!"\n\nThe chief looked carefully at Jim. "Jim, did you shoot and kill a member'a the Brotherhood'a Steel over a game of poker?" He waited for a few seconds. "And wasn't it just last year you got a red warnin' for killin' a bandit who'd already put his hands up?" Jim looked indignant. "For the last time, I'm tellin' you he was cheatin'! We're supposed to keep to the law; ain't there gotta be justice if someone cheats?" Carefully, Callahan pulled his desk drawer open. He pulled a jet black pistol with a silencer out of the drawer and pointed it up at the deputy, who suddenly froze and stared right down the pistol's muzzled barrel."

The ol' I-10, if you'd believe it. Back in pre-war days, the state patrol our uniforms are based on would use that highway quite often. Dad always figured it'd be a nice bit'a symbolism. Keep the 10th 'cause we'd been through nine big issues so far, but also because Lafayette's right next to the ol' I-10."\n\nFranklin gave the chief a low chuckle. "Now that is interesting. And I will say I'd wondered why the defeat at Alexandria never convinced the old chief to go up to the 11th. That's interesting." The two sat in silence for another minute.

The two patrol leads closest to Mack stood up, still giggling. Between the three of them, Mack got hauled out of the bar, placed onto the flat bed of a pickup truck outside, and finally taken home. Mack's family was in, and they had a rather worried laugh on their end when they'd heard what happened. The chief moved upstairs and helped the two leads haul Mack into his bed. As was tradition, they then had a last bit of fun with some face paint around the unconscious lead's closed eyes to mark the occasion. Then they thanked Mack's folks and returned to the bar to resume discussing the many quirks of the New Orleans mob while they finished their drinks."

Callahan leaned back in his chair and turned his gaze from patrol lead Franklin to his office's door. "Come in!" he shouted.\nThe door opened, and Deputy Trainee Andrews—the new-ish guy from the Texan deputy systems—quietly entered. "You asked to see me, sir?"\n"Yup. Have a seat."\n"Ok." Andrews closed the door behind him and sat down in the chair opposite the chief's desk. He nodded at Franklin, who nodded back. "I'm not in trouble, am I?"\nCallahan tilted his black hat forward an inch. "'Fraid you are, Andrews. I've been doin' some diggin'. See, we've been havin' trouble since my father's day with too high bribes, trouble bein' made for folks who didn't pay unreasonable fees, and civilians gettin' caught up in too many bandit runs. For the longest time I figured it was the patrol largely doin' their own thing and pocketing the change. And yeah, sometimes they did do that.

Franklin's eyes went wide in the corner—the chief knew Reagan was of Franklin's closest friends back in the day. He ignored the reaction and focused on Andrews' pokerface. "When Reagan kicked the bucket a couple years back, the payments went normal across the board for a few months. Then we took you on and Reagan's fees returned, and so did the trouble if they weren't paid. Now..." The chief laid out two pictures and passed them across the desk to Andrews, who leaned over to look at them. "We've got you pinned passin' Patrolmen protection caps off to bankers in Lone Star and mobsters in New Orleans. The Patrolmen were never a corrupt organization, at least not the extent we thought. It just had a few rotten members." Callahan sat up straight in his chair. Andrews shrugged and looked at the chief. There was a wait time of about two seconds before Andrews' right hand shot out of his holster with his revolver extended. There was a flash of light and a bang. Callahan's outstretched hand lowered while Andrews' body slumped in his chair. His hand was shaking, and he frowned. "Figured he'd try somethin' like that."\nFranklin stood up, looking rather sad. "You're sure about Reagan?"\n"Dead sure, I'm afraid."\n"Then give that private eye my regards. He saw what I couldn't."

He took a cigar from a small metal box on the desk and lit as he sat down. He pressed a button on his desk so a small, quiet fan would activate to make sure the room didn't start to smell like smoke. The second man was the Patrol Chief, a slightly younger man than Rusk wearing a blue uniform with a gold badge. He took his wide-brimmed hat off and set it down on the tabletop while he sat down in a the chair on the other side of the desk. Rusk inhaled deeply, then blew a small ring of smoke out of his mouth. He watched it drift lazily across the desk, then chuckled with the built-in fan sucked it to the side before it reached the other side. "That one never gets old." The patrol chief smiled as well."

    nf_tpm_events_continued.41.d:0 ""Well," the chief started, "I've been hearin' some rumors 'bout the politics up 'ere in Dallas. Now, it's an all-day drive to get from Dallas to Lafayette so I can't exactly speak to the reliability of what I've been hearin' but those rumors have been... uh... concerning, to say the least. Figured I'd come up and talk it over with ya myself. See where everythin' lies."\nRusk nodded slowly. "Yeah, I'm guessing most of what you've heard is true, to some extent or another. I've been managing a careful situation. What is it you've heard?"\nCallahan leaned back in his chair and sighed. "Well, for starters, a lotta the boys in Lafayette have been talkin' good on y'all for takin' care'a some'a the raiders and cannibals over in east Texas. 'Specially those guys up in Carthage. They've caused a lotta problems for us over the years, and the boys asked me to tell ya it's nice to know we ain't alone in wantin' to keep some peace'n quiet in the area." Rusk nodded appreciatively. "But, uh, if ya don't mind me sayin' so, I've been hearin' rumors y'all have been considerin' takin' a crack at Alexandria as well. Now, I been hearin' all these stories 'bout how you've been gettin' everyone high on believin' Texas can be a proper nation someday, but if ya don't mind me sayin' so, Alexandria ain't Texas. And if you're goin' for that, lotta the boys have gotten concerned Lafayette could be next." He paused for a moment, and Rusk looked down at his shoes while he puffed out another batch of smoke. "Well, that's why I'm 'ere. Seein' as how y'all might wanna take a bite outa non-Texan land, I've gotten my boys sold on the idea of joinin' y'all. If you'd have us, Lafayette's Patrolmen would like to join the, uh, that economic union thing y'all've got goin'. That, and I've been authorized to offer a little bit'a tribute to appease some'a your more aggressive folks, if that's needed." The chief leaned back and smiled.

He swirled the smoke around in his mouth for a moment, then blew a long, thin line towards the chief. It got sucked up by the fan before it reached the chief's face. Then he smiled "You've got yourself a deal," he said at length.\nThe chief looked a bit confused. "What, that's it?"\n"Well, yeah," Rusk explained. "My council's been empowered to make a set of decisions regarding the Louisiana issue, and you've got more sympathetic voices on that council than you'd expect. Lot of our boys like what you've been doing down in Lafayette, making sure the raiders never got so out of control that they joined up with each other to cause bigger problems. Truth is, the council's already decided it wanted to send you an offer of integration backed up by force, but they also gave me permission to do talking on their behalf. They'll be disappointed I won't be supporting their gambit to annex a solid chunk of Louisiana in the process, but if gets you in the Economic Union while also allowing military aid instead of fighting or a complicated integration, I'd frankly say that sounds like a much better plan." He stopped talking and turned to the computer console on the left side of his desk. "One moment."

It spat out a single piece of paper that Rusk briefly looked over before sliding to the chief. "Just a formality, you understand. We hand over any Louisiana land we happen to have, you join the Economic Union, we agree to help each other in future wars, you hand over that bribe you mentioned, and we renounce any claims on Louisiana in perpetuity, among a few other finer details.

He made an effort not to fall asleep, but he needed a break. A few minutes later, he heard a light tapping on his window. He opened his eyes and saw Patrol Lead Franklin outlined against the bright building across the lot. He sat his chair up, tried to roll down his window, remembered that implied power, and finally opened the door. Franklin backed up while the chief stepped out.\n\n"Well?" The chief stared deadpan at Franklin for a few seconds. Then he smiled. "We got it! Yes!" The pair had a good laugh and hugged each other. "Phew! Man, what a day. Heck of a drive." "I can imagine. Been a few decades since I was last in Dallas, though I imagine there's probably not as many bandits on the main roads these days." "You're tellin' me.

The chief's cat stopped sneezing from his place on the bed just long enough to meow at Callahan's entrance. The chief and the old man sat down on opposite sides of the chief's desk. "So really, how'd it go? We all started gettin' worried when we didn't hear from you for so long."\n\n"Man, it was a cakewalk. Glad I went though—turns out Rusk's council wanted to try to integrate us directly and woulda used force to back it up unless we came up with another offer. But ol' Eddie's a pretty decent fella, and he'd been given permission to accept any deal we came up with. Turns out our deal was a pretty good one." "I did tell you they'd be idiots to turn it down." "I know! I just—I dunno, maybe I've been thinkin' they are idiots. Shame on me, then." The two laughed a bit more, then spent a moment in silence. Then they picked up the conversation in a more casual manner that last for about an hour. After that, Franklin locked up and left, and Callahan climbed into his bed and fell asleep.

"Aye, makes sense. Still, thanks for hearin' me out on all this. Means a lot to me."\n"Of course; nothin' I wouldn't do for anyone else." Rusk raised his right finger suddenly. "Ooh, almost forgot. Gimme a second." He typed something up on the computer sitting on the left side of his desk, then had it print to the printer on the wall behind him.
