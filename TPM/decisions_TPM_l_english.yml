  patrol_home_descision: "Patrol Home Territory"
  patrol_home_descision_desc: "There's nothin' like a good, clean patrol around the fine city'a Lafayette. Patrols around the home front are usually uneventful training opportunities, but they more often end up turning into all-expenses-paid bonding exercises with one's own patrol. Open campfires at night, long hikes with friendly stories and group songs in the day, a bit of target practice on the local goose population when you get hungry... It's the lifestyle of the Lafayette Patrolmen that attracts most of our recruits, and as long as you like the great outdoors and are fine with occasional foot cramps, our corner of the "wasteland" is a very respectable one, and we'd do anything to defend it."
  patrol_bayou_decision: "Patrol the Bayou Swamp"
  patrol_bayou_decision_desc: "The Cannery is honestly a very nice place, and it's a darn shame we had to wage a war to take the place over. It's not the prettiest spot'a mud on the map, but it's got some pretty glades, the water's nice, and the people there are generally about as kind and respectable as the folks in Lafayette, just a bit more salty due to mostly being port towns. Patrolling the waters around The Cannery is a fairly simple task, and it'll be good to get our boys out on the open waves for a change—some of our guys are real landlubbers, but the remnants of the Motors' coast guard have really made us aware of just how refreshing a day in the calm waves of the Gulf can be. Let's go hunt some pirates!"
  patrol_maw_decision: "Patrol Alexandria's Jungles"
  patrol_maw_decision_desc: " Alexandria's always been a mess. Since even Franklin's earliest memories, he can't recall a time when Alexandria was a respectable city. Now, granted, since we took over the place we've been givin' it our all tryin' to turn that cesspit into a sister city for Lafayette, but our efforts have been... Less than successful. Bandits still roam the streets at night, children are basically feral in their behavior, and there's only a few stable families like you'd see in Lafayette holding the whole city together. But despite the issues, Alexandria's under the banner of our Patrol now, and it's our job to keep the peace and uphold law and order wherever we patrol. Alexandria, sadly, will not earn an exception."
  patrol_trade_rivers_decision: "Patrol the Mississippi Trade Rivers"
  patrol_trade_rivers_decision_desc: "One nice thing about having such easy river access is that a ton of trade heads up and down the Mississippi and its surrounding tributaries. Sending a few patrol boats out to do the rounds protecting merchant shipping is always a profitable venture, as it's pretty much inevitable we'll interrupt some half-bit river heist or another, and it's a lot easier to extract a minor fee from a recently-saved friendly merchant ship than to take the angry ship and its crew entirely. Plus it'll put some of our boys on the water, which'll be useful if we find a need to fight on the rivers while we're out there."
  hunt_bluff_bandits_decision: "Hunt the Bandits of the Bluff"
  hunt_bluff_bandits_decision_desc: "Moss Bluff's a nice town with nice folks, but we'd be lying if we said the forests surrounding the town weren't the biggest bandit nest this side of the Mississippi. Criminals from all over come to make little hideouts in those forests, fully aware of the danger the Patrol poses to them, and fully ignorant of just how many of those bandits we end up sniffing out despite their overconfidence. Every now and then we have to head down there and do the rounds to keep the bandit presence from spiralling out of control. Well, no time like the present."
  patrol_overlord_territory: "Patrol Our Overlord's Lands"
  patrol_overlord_territory: "While it's not the most ideal situation to have a bigger boss than the Patrol Chief, the one trick we always have up our sleeves is just going out and doing a patrol. We won't be able to get away with it too often, but as a political stunt, taking over some of the patrol duties our overlord's neglected on their home front could be a nice way to buy us some room to work with in terms of gaining autonomy. Let's head on over their and show their people how ineffective their army is by doing their job for them just to rub in how efficient the Patrolmen are at their namesake career."
  form_eleventh_patrol: "Reestablish the 10th Patrol"
  form_eleventh_patrol_desc: "Let's be honest about something—the current Community Council is really, really not up to the task of running Lafayette. Sure, the council members all know a bit about their own individual fields, but there's not a man in this city with any leadership talent who wasn't already a member of the Patrolmen, and they just have the knack for dealing with tough decisions that the civilian side of things never even had reason to try learning. Can we, uh... Can we just get Callahan to take over again? He's a nice guy and at least he'd know what he was doing with our current messy situation."
  tpm_just_another_patrol_category:0 "Just Another Patrol"
  tpm_just_another_patrol_category_desc: "From downtown Lafayette to the lonely Bar of Efrafa on our western border with the Rockets, everyone in our territory knows one thing to be true—if you get into some trouble, just yell for help and you'll get help from the Gold and Blue. Things aren't what they used to be, of course, but the patrols keep goin' out on a regular basis and the Louisiana Lawkeepers do their best to make sure bandits and mobsters don't get a hold in the land around the good city of Lafayette. It's not a perfect system, but it's what we got, and we'll do our best to protect our homes."
