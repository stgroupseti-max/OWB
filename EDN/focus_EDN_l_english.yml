  EDN_starting_from_scratch:0 "Starting From Scratch"
  EDN_starting_from_scratch_desc:0 "When we arrived here, we brought very little with us, nothing that couldn't be carried. The first few years were tight, but we managed to scrape by enough to lay the foundations for the future of our people."

  EDN_those_we_protect:0 "Those We Protect"
  EDN_those_we_protect_desc:0 "At first, we were few, but since we arrived here at the Vault of Eden, we have gradually accepted more and more into our ranks and undertaken greater responsibilities. Many small communities throughout Central Texas now depend on us for their protection."

  EDN_emergency_government_spending:0 "Emergency Government Spending"
  EDN_emergency_government_spending_desc:0 "While we typically don't demand much from the people we protect, every now and again, there results in some extraordinary circumstances which necessitate asking for just a little bit more to keep us going. Now is one of those times."

  EDN_emergency_draft:0 "Emergency Draft"
  EDN_emergency_draft_desc:0 "Our front lines are wearing thin; we cannot afford to wait for the next Wastelander who wants to die for their country to join the army. We need men and equipment now; it's time for every able-bodied man and woman to do their duty, whether they want to or not."

  EDN_scavenging_for_tools:0 "Scavenging for Tools"
  EDN_scavenging_for_tools_desc:0 "Procuring tools in Eden has never been an easy task. The land, even pre-war, was primarily used for ranching and agriculture. This lack of easily accessible pre-war sources, and our small capacity to produce them, means we must rely heavily upon scavenging to acquire our tools."

  EDN_working_with_what_we_have:0 "Working With What We Have"
  EDN_working_with_what_we_have_desc:0 "We have received reports of all kinds of old work tech and salvage in our territories; we should make the most of these scarce resources and put them to good use."

  EDN_internal_development:0 "Internal Development"
  EDN_internal_development_desc:0 "To improve the lives of our people, it is necessary, every now and again, to invest some resources back into the communities we draw from. We should encourage members of these communities to start small businesses and trade with each other."

  EDN_hire_construction_experts:0 "Hire Construction Experts"
  EDN_hire_construction_experts_desc:0 "When we arrived here, the majority of the people of Eden were living in Shacks made of scrap and in the remains of the old bombed-out pre-war buildings.

  EDN_ensuring_our_protection:0 "§REnsuring Our Protection§!"
  EDN_ensuring_our_protection_desc:0 "What's the use of planning for our future if we can't guarantee we'll have one? We should prioritize increasing our arms production to ensure that we have the means to defend the G.E.C.K. and our people."

  EDN_investing_in_our_future:0 "§5Investing in Our Future§!"
  EDN_investing_in_our_future_desc:0 "How do guns improve our people's quality of life? Protecting and maintaining the status quo will not cut it if we want our people to thrive.

  EDN_refining_our_tactics:0 "Refining Our Tactics"
  EDN_refining_our_tactics_desc:0 "The last time we fought a serious battle was over a decade ago, and while we've retained our fighting prowess, we have depended too heavily on our outdated tactics. We can remedy this by forcing our troops to train for different scenarios and promoting bright new officers with innovative ideas."

  EDN_we_need_more_guns:0 "We Need More Guns"
  EDN_we_need_more_guns_desc:0 "We'll need more guns, more boots, more helmets, and more power armor if we want to stand any chance of surviving the conflicts just over the horizon. The G.E.C.K. and our people must be protected at all costs."

  EDN_improving_old_designs_desc:0 "While we've contented ourselves over the past decade with using what worked in the past, there's always room for improvement.

  EDN_purchase_anti_material_rifles:0 "Purchase Anti-Material Rifles"
  EDN_purchase_anti_material_rifles_desc:0 "Sometimes a 5.56 bullet just doesn't cut it; some enemies are more heavily armored than others. To solve this dilemma, we'll purchase anti-material rifles from the Texan Arms Association and train our soldiers on how to use them effectively."

  EDN_expand_power_armor_training:0 "§PExpand Power Armor Training§!"
  EDN_expand_power_armor_training_desc:0 "While no army can function without infantry, power armor is the true core of our military. We should focus on giving more troops better training in power armor."

  EDN_expand_specialist_training:0 "§OExpand Specialist Training§!"

  EDN_the_unrealized_threat:0 "The Unrealized Threat"
  EDN_the_unrealized_threat_desc:0 "While many see Keats and the Unity of Austin as admirable in creating a society for both humans and mutants, they nonetheless pose a threat to the security of the G.E.C.K. and must be dealt with accordingly."

  EDN_old_allies_new_enemies:0 "Old Allies, New Enemies..."
  EDN_old_allies_new_enemies_desc:0 "While Scarlet got her start in the Brotherhood of Steel as an assassin of the Circle of Steel, her loyalties lie elsewhere. The Alamo Chapter and their obsession with technology remain a threat to Eden and the G.E.C.K. we protect. They must be eliminated."

  EDN_calix:0 "Calix's Resourcefulness"
  EDN_calix_desc:0 "We have discovered yet another of Vault-Tec's pre-war relics in the former territory of Shale's Army; an AI "vending machine" called Calix. Calix's purpose is to fulfill any request given to it by the customer; perhaps this sophisticated pre-war supercomputer may be able to help us repair the corrupted G.E.C.K."

  EDN_ironmongers_ingenuity:0 "Ironmongers' Ingenuity"
  EDN_ironmongers_ingenuity_desc:0 "Although the intelligence of most of those in the Ironmongers may be... below average, one cannot deny their aptitude for all things engineering.

  EDN_austins_knowledge:0 "Austin's Knowledge"
  EDN_austins_knowledge_desc:0 "Austin is a place of many great minds, their scientists being some of the foremost in all of Texas.

  EDN_naval_buildup:0 "Water Ward"
  EDN_naval_buildup_desc:0 "The waters we now border offer yet new ways to invade our home. Protecting them will take investment into a new type of warrior: one which wards the rivers and even the oceans if need be."

  EDN_industrial_revolution:0 "An Industrial Revolution"

  EDN_learning_from_the_best:0 "Learning From the Best"
  EDN_learning_from_the_best_desc:0 "There's no doubt that the Texas Arms Association are the best gunsmiths in Texas, perhaps throughout the entire Wasteland.

  EDN_the_matter_of_texas_desc:0 "While we may control much of Southern Texas, there is still the matter of the lands that sit on the bank of the Rio Grande, some of which are controlled by the Rio Grande Republic. It is best to address this issue before a conflict arises."

  EDN_cultural_exchange:0 "Cultural Exchange"
  EDN_cultural_exchange_desc:0 "Our increased cooperation with Rio has had some unintended consequences. However, not all of them are negative; quite the opposite.

  EDN_the_benefits_of_trade:0 "The Benefits of Trade"
  EDN_the_benefits_of_trade_desc:0 "While there's still a significant amount of trade conducted throughout the Wasteland, rarely are there official trade agreements signed between countries.

  EDN_the_houston_conference:0 "The Houston Conference"
  EDN_the_houston_conference_desc:0 "While relations with the Texan Brotherhood have been relatively warm up until this point, our recent annexation of the Unity of Austin has become a point of contention.

  EDN_advanced_technical_armor_development_desc:0 "It has been difficult for our scientists, brilliant though they may be, to work without access to a broader community.

  EDN_the_mechanical_tyrants_desc:0 "We have heard many tales of the evil mechanical tyrants south of the Rio Grande, who have no regard for their people and only care for their own goals. These malfunctioning, Machiavellian A.I. must be stopped before they conquer all of Mexico."

  EDN_the_liberators_of_mexico_desc:0 "No more will the evil A.I. tyrants oppress the people of Mexico; we have vanquished them once and for all. The people of Mexico will know freedom and prosperity under Eden and her soldiers, the liberators of Mexico."

  EDN_the_matter_of_texas_tex:0 "The Matter of Southern Texas"
  EDN_the_matter_of_texas_tex_desc:0 "While we may control much of Southern Texas, there is still the matter of the lands that sit on the bank of the Rio Grande, some of which are controlled by the Rio Grande Republic. It is best to address this issue before a conflict arises."
