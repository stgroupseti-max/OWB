  EDN_brotherhood_knowledge_desc:0 "The Brotherhood of Steel hold knowledge of the Old World, so when Scarlet and those under her command went into isolation to defend the G.E.C.K., they took several brotherhood records with them to teach those who would follow them."

  EDN_the_corpse1:0 "The Rotting Corpse"
  EDN_the_corpse1_desc:0 "Many years ago, Reese, a Cipher warlord, managed to steal a G.E.C.K. from a place known as "The Nursery." He used it across the Wasteland, transforming a long stretch of land from central Colorado to the Gulf of Mexico into dense mutated jungles. If it wasn't for Scarlet stopping him, he might have been able to transform all of the Wasteland into his hellish tropical paradise.\nIn recent years, while the majority of the mutation around the bombed-out shell of Corpus Christi - where the final battle between Scarlet and Reese took place - has been cleaned out, there is still the matter of the G.E.C.K. itself.\nWe were never able to destroy it, thus - Scarlet brought it to a secluded place known as Eden and with a small contingent of Brotherhood scouts have gone into isolation as they seek to prevent the G.E.C.K.'s influence from corrupting anything else."

  EDN_the_corpse2:0 "The Weakening Grip"
  EDN_the_corpse2_desc:0 "Although still formidable, the G.E.C.K.'s influence is no longer as strong as it once was. When cleared out, patches of brush and foliage do not immediately grow back."

  EDN_the_corpse3:0 "First Signs of Progress"
  EDN_the_corpse3_desc:0 "Though one may still look at the lands surrounding the G.E.C.K. and see a dense, mutated jungle, the truth is that it has receded greatly. There are now many places where light breaks through the now much thinner foliage, and some of the more dangerous creatures of the jungle, without as many places to hide, have increasingly fallen prey to our hunters. Our efforts to purify the G.E.C.K. are beginning to show serious signs of progress."

  EDN_the_corpse4:0 "A New Beginning?"
  EDN_the_corpse4_desc:0 "The area around the Vault of Eden has been cleared out; the only remains of the once hellish mutated jungle are confined to the vault's interior. The scars on the landscape are still visible but are now beginning to heal. We have made major breakthroughs in our efforts to purify the G.E.C.K. and are close to restoring it to working condition."

  EDN_the_corpse5:0 "Paradise"
  EDN_the_corpse5_desc:0 "We have finally done it, the G.E.C.K. has been purified, and the results have been nothing short of a miracle. Rolling fields of lush grass, not seen since before the Great War, now dominate the landscape, bringing people from all over Texas to settle in what's being referred to as the Garden of Eden."

  EDN_unprepared:0 "Unprepared"
  EDN_unprepared_desc:0 "Eden, wholly consumed with defending the Corpse for the past decade, is in no state to fight a protracted war. The few remaining officers lack basic training in tactics and warfare, the rank and file lack cohesion, and the army generally lacks equipment."
