  EDN_SCARLET_NAME: "Scarlet"
  EDN_SCARLET_DESC:0 "§t"Did you hear about the rose that grew\nfrom a crack in the concrete?\nProving nature's law is wrong it\nlearned to walk without having feet.\nFunny it seems, but by keeping its dreams,\nit learned to breathe fresh air.\nLong live the rose that grew from concrete\nwhen no one else ever cared.\nI am the rose that grew from the concrete. I am the thorn in your side."§!\n\nAbandoned at birth for being albino. Scarlet would've died had she not had a fortunate encounter with a mutant named Harold. She traveled the wastes with him as he recounted his adventures with the Vault Dweller. When she became an adult, she joined the Brotherhood of Steel, which trained her in the art of assassination due to her matching "Moral Ambiguity."\n\nDuring the dramatic events of the 60s, she hunted down Reese and ended his plot to poison the land with a corrupted GECK, saving both the B.O.S. and Keats. Not long after, she seized the mutant GECK and deserted the Brotherhood, Taking it to Eden where its power couldn't harm innocents--or be used for evil. Now she prowls the blood-red jungle as its undisputed sovereign, killing all trespassers silently, like a predator stalking prey."
