  OST_PATRIARCH_JONAS_NAME: "Patriarch Jonas Montgomery"
  OST_PATRIARCH_JONAS_DESC: "The plagues of God are known to weed out the faithless and weak from the folk; it is the place of Patriarch Jonas Montgomery to shepherd what is left. For centuries the Watchers have kept order in Sanctum, Patriarchs have come and gone through the sands of time, but Jonas has a vision. A vision bestowed to him as a young man, broken from his sleep in a cold sweat, he was commanded to build an army to protect the chosen from the upcoming wrath. This vision has carried Jonas from a lowly priest into the chambers of the Watcher, leading all who bow to God’s word.\n\nThe power vested into such an idealist has birthed the solution to the ills of this corrupted and fallen world. Jonas oversaw the creation of his new army, from the white walls covered in blue light to the training grounds on the outskirts of Sanctum, Jonas’ watchful eye was protecting his children. Soon he shall let loose his army of Angels to finish the work of the Army of Light once and for all."

  OST_ISSAC_HOTHAM_NAME: "Judge Issac Hotham"
  OST_ISSAC_HOTHAM_DESC: ""When the mortal plane is plagued by God’s trials, he shall send his champions to fight the minions of Satan."\n\nThat was the line Judge Issac Hotham remembers to himself when the rivers of blood fill his trenchline. Patriarch Montgomery yelled those words as Hotham and his fellow Judges led the so-called Army of Light into the depths of the Plaguelands. Their first contact with the tainted air of the Plaguelands would pierce even their ancient power armor straight into their souls.\n\nDay by day, month by month, the toll of their assignment would drag the souls of the twelve Judges. It wasn’t long before the cracked open and infested remnants of the Judge’s power armor would return to Sanctum. Hotham and his men were the last of the broken Army of Light. Hotham was far from the strongest, or even most knowledgeable Judge; he was the eleventh Judge to be picked. However, he is the last of God’s chosen shepherds, he will remain at his post as it is God’s will."
