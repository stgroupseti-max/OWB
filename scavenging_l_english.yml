  scavenging_decisions:0 "Reclamation Authority"
  scavenging_decisions_desc:0 "Producing our equipment is all well and good, but the Wasteland is also a treasure trove of ancient secrets waiting to be discovered. This knowledge is often hidden, guarded, and perilous to recover. We can send out search parties to find things in the wastes (risking their lives in the process) at the expense of some caps. Hopefully our teams will return with something we can use."

  scavenge.101.d:0 "Balancing the needs of different groups in our administration is a delicate task.

  # Scavenging start orders
  scavenge.102.t:0 "Scavenging Orders"
  scavenge.102.desc:0 "The Reclamation Authority suggests granting our scavengers operational autonomy to have the best chances of a successful mission.\n\nHowever, if [Root.GetLeader] thinks there is something specific our people need to prioritize finding, they can be given direct orders.\n\nIf a scavenging team is unable to locate what they were ordered to, they may return with something else of value. Nevertheless, potentially useful salvage may be overlooked in the pursuit of the current objective."

  scavenge.1.t:0 "The Scavengers Found Something!"
  scavenge.1.d:0 "In the ruins of a pre-war site, our scavengers found something that caught their eye. Time will tell whether it was worth the blood and sweat they paid for it."
  scavenge.1.a:0 "Better in our hands than our enemies."

  scavenge.2.t:0 "The Old World Blues"
  scavenge.2.d:0 "Our scavengers have failed to find something, spending weeks in the Wastes in pursuit of old dreams. The scavengers are so obsessed with the past they can't see the present, much less the future, for what it is. And so they wasted their times on a fools errand, for what?"
  scavenge.2.a:0 "Finding nothing, they stare into the what-was, guttering and spent."

  scavenge.3.t:0 "Deathclaws Ate Our Team!"
  scavenge.3.d:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader], terrible news. A pack of deathclaws set upon our scavenging expedition, stripping their flesh like gecko on a stick. The few bloody survivors have sworn never to visit that site again. "
  scavenge.3.a:0 "This is a terrible day for our men and nation."
  scav_deathclaw_tt:0 "§gSome of our team managed to make it back to our lands, bringing with them horrifying tales...§!\n"

  scavenge.5.t:0 "The Scavengers Triumph!"
  scavenge.5.d:0 "In the ruins of a pre-war site, our scavengers found something that caught their eye. A caravan of trucks is bringing the expedition's plunder back to [Root.Capital.GetName]. This is a great triumph for us!"
  scavenge.5.a:0 "A mighty step into the future."

  scavenge.6.t:0 "Our Scavengers Found Nothing!"
  scavenge.6.d:0 "Despite the flat tires, the blood lost, and the fuel spent, we found nothing in our scavenging expedition. But perhaps [Root.GetLeader], the real reward was the friendships formed?"
  scavenge.6.a:0 "Get out of my office."

  scavenge.7.t:0 "Deathclaws Ate Some of Our Team!"
  scavenge.7.d:0 "It appears that a deathclaw ate one of our motorcycles and the people on it. The survivors fled as quickly as possible, but more of them were left behind when the trucks drove off. This is pretty embarrassing."
  scavenge.7.a:0 "Maybe we should have given them power armor instead."

  # Power armour scavers
  scavenge.9.t:0 "Our Scavengers Return in Triumph!"
  scavenge.9.d:0 "Neither raider nor deathclaw nor super-mutants will stop our scavengers. They have returned to [Root.Capital.GetName], their power armor caked in blood and grime. Let this example show the potential for our future."
  scavenge.9.a:0 "Time for some new world hopes."

  scavenge.10.t:0 "Scavengers Return Empty Handed"
  scavenge.10.d:0 "Apparently providing a power armour escort to our scavengers kept them safe, but it made them no more successful. Oh well, it's not like we needed that armour for our military. Did we?"
  scavenge.10.a:0 "Well that was pointless."

  scavenge.11.t:0 "Power Armour Scavengers Attacked!"
  scavenge.11.d:0 "I don't understand how, [Root.GetLeader], but our scavengers were attacked. A band of raiders in power armour launched a coordinated strike upon our scavengers and created an epic battle that left dozens dead. The ensuing battle wiped out a nearby village, and many of the raiders died, but we had to retreat."
  scavenge.11.a:0 "How can raiders field power armour?"

  # Scavenging project initiated
  scavenge.15.t:0 "The Reclamation Authority"
  scavenge.15.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has decided to construct a Reclamation Authority, devoted to promoting scavenging in the Wasteland. This will give our nation expertise in scouring the Wastes."
  scavenge.15.a:0 "The Old World's secrets will be ours!"

  # Scaving dismantled
  scavenge.16.t:0 "End Scavenging"
