  MXS_INVESTOR_NAME: "The Investor"
  MXS_INVESTOR_DESC: "The de-facto warden of Max Sec, the Investor, oversees the prison's labour system. Extremely rich and completely lacking in morality, the Investor will stop at nothing to extract every last cap from his prisoners."

  MXS_WHOZ_NAME: "Whoz"
  MXS_WHOZ_DESC: "An intelligent super mutant, Whoz rose to prominence after his capture by NCR forces. While they had originally planned to execute him, a small band of Max Sec officers offered to pay for him in exchange. Since his time in Max Sec began, Whoz has led a prominent gang of super mutants from inside the prison walls. However, unlike most of the other super mutants in Max Sec, Whoz has maintained a decent standing amongst other human prisoners. This trait paid off following his escape from the prison, as his ability to negotiate with rival gangs allowed him to form a larger army. For now, Whoz is the de facto leader of the area. That could change at any minute however, as the former criminals of Max Sec were never known for their loyalty."
