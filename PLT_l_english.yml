  PLT_FRANKIE_DESC:0 ""Elections? Qualified individuals? Electoral state or not, answer this for me: what do most of the people out here in The Katch do? Smudge up everything with their greasy fingers and lick doorknobs? I'm not letting anybody else in my chair unless their last name is 'Chase,' and that's that." -Maxwell Chase, Mayor of Pleasantdale\n\nFrankie Chase, the eldest and only remaining child of Maxwell Chase, has been forced to step up to the mayoral seat in the wake of his recent disappearance. While nervous and still only a teenager, they're trying their best to maintain the same steady composure and finnicky sense of control their father once held."
  PLT_HOPE_DESC:0 "§M"Howdy there! I'm your new personal assistant— for life!"§! \n\nHope, much like her sister Destiny, was an AI created by MANIFEST. Whereas Destiny was meant to serve as the main 'enforcement' force, Hope was intended for a far more supplementary role. While she has little interest in following her own directives, Hope LOVES helping people. In fact, she loves it so much that she's maintained a large majority of MANIFEST Saskatchewan! She and Maxwell Chase achieved great things together, from the Faeries to the Lucifers that make Pleasantdale such a terrible paradise."
  PLT_BARKFACE_DESC:0 "§YWelcome, Olivia Baxter.§! \n\n§RSUBJECT: 'BARKFACE'§! \n\n§YBarkface is a Generation 2 Faerie, which means that she's old enough to become a victim to the Arborification, except it's only affecting her head for whatever reason. While we'd like to study this, we can barely get close without her threatening to slice us up in pieces. Hopefully we can get a little data before she turns entirely.§!"
  PLT_CATCAT_DESC:0 "§YWelcome, Olivia Baxter.§! \n\n§RSUBJECT: 'Catcat'§! \n\n§YNow this is a weird one, despite Catcat being a fairly old Generation 3 Faerie, she shows no signs of aggression, rather she defends her friends when they're training together. While we have no way of actually studying this without risking killing her with our experiments, it's interesting to note nevertheless.§!"
  PLT_HOLLY_DESC:0 "§YWelcome, Olivia Baxter.§! \n\n§RSUBJECT: 'Holly'§! \n\n§YHolly is another odd case, despite her friendliness and kind nature towards the other Faeries, during battle she is, as described by her instructor, 'a beast'. While she's very eager to get out there and fight for us, perhaps her brutality is a little too far, with reports saying that it seems like she enjoys the killing. I'd hate to be those guys she fights!§!"
  PLT_BORSEY_DESC:0 "§YWelcome, Olivia Baxter.§! \n\n§RSUBJECT: 'Borsey'§! \n\n§YBorsey is one of the younger Faeries, though she moves in halting fashion like one much older. Medical inspections have implied that a number of her joints are mutated, causing her joints to stiffen and grind painfully against her bones, though we have been reluctant to perform any invasive procedures to confirm our suspicions. Borsey has performed well in intelligence and toughness tests however, and has done good work so far. Porsey is her 'sister', though only in an adoptive sense, and they are one of the few pairings we suggest supporting for operations in the field.§!"

She never stops moving and fidgeting and has difficulty paying attention to orders and instructions. It's recommended to provide her enrichment regularly to keep her from destroying the facilities idly. Borsey acts like an adoptive sister to her and seems to be good at keeping her under some kind of control as the more hyperactive Faerie is unwilling to leave her behind. Recommend keeping them as a pair.§!"

Well, that's not us, but what is sane these days? \n\nGiven how the world likes to operate, you probably stumbled through and are pleased with the fact that nobody was trying to shoot you on the way in, so I'll go ahead and give you the schpeel. I'm Maxwell Chase, Mayor of Pleasantdale. \n\nNow, you might have heard of us if you're from one of the nearby towns, so let me clarify a few things just to ease the air. First, yes, we do have the highest infant mortality rate. Luckily, that doesn't put a dent in you or me, pal, so we're good to go. Moral of the story, if you hate kids, we're perfect for any enterprising child-free wastelander. What else?... Oh, right. If anyone told you about the consequences of Red Fern usage, I wouldn't sweat it. If you're really worried, just don't smoke it! It's that simple, folks. \n\nIf you're from Dundurn, my wife has a biased outlook on how we operate. So, don't listen to her. She's crazy and wants to put your brain in a metal box.§!"

  nf_plt.2.d:0 "PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE FROM §GMAXWELL CHASE§!\n\nSUBJECT: §GTHE Faerie PROGRAM§!\n\n§BSo. Lots of people want me to clarify a few things about the "who, what, where" of the Faeries, our amazing and stalwart protectors. Pleasantdale has no standing military. I mean, look at us. We aren't fighters— we're looking to live a happy life away from the rest of world, and whether that means playing mini-golf in the middle of a blizzard or eating a Mutfruit Pie outside the Red Heels Club, I'm here for it. I'm not one to take a punch to the jaw and let it simmer, either, so when Toboggan came through and told me "75% of the babies in your town are dying," I told him he can shove his data up his rear and that I'd be the first one to worry about issues in Pleasantdale. And I don't ever worry, so I fixed it. We can always identify if a kid has the symptoms as the others that were going to die: if they have pustules, a cough, or anything else, we take them and we prevent them from dying. How do we do that? The Faerie Program. \n\nBelieve me: if we didn't come through, they'd have died and just made everything worse for everyone. This way, they're not only serving the community, but we're getting some kind of use out of the whole thing. I mean, what are we going to do, open a big private cemetery for ever Jane and John's four month old carcass? That'd be absurd. \n\nThe Faeries are our highly-capable and happy protectors, and that's that. If anyone has an issue with it, I'm sure they'd love to hear the geopolitical takes of a random dirt-faced wastelander!§!"

It's a great narcotic, and we can make even better chems with it. It's got everything an aspiring wastelander could want— it induces a high enough to kick an Umbravore out of the dark, and it's got medicinal properties out the wazoo. The lab boys find something new with it every weekend, I swear. \n\nWhat's really outstanding about it, and probably the best export we've picked up on, are Lucifers. Little cigarettes we can sell that induce a sort of temporary 'mutation' in the bloodstream, or something like that. Anyway, when you take a smoke of it, you might find yourself slinging a bit of fire from your fingers, or maybe you can smell a thousand more smells than you did three seconds before. That's not the high, that's the mutation. Don't light your friends on fire for a joke. And yes, it has happened. Many times. \n\nThe point of the gist, folks, is this: we sell psychic powers you can get from just a puff of smoke. If that isn't the magic of Pleasantdale at work, I don't know what it is, folks— but let me tell you, it sure does make for a great festival or two.§!"

We light to keep the lights on around here, and unlike some pre-war yahoos, I don't get to throw caps at some doofus at the plant and hope for the best. We had to make our own. So! That being said, we have to make sure it actually stays on, or else we're just another junkerville in the blizzard waiting to die. \n\nOh, and if the power goes out and you see Deborah, you hit her on that dome of hers so hard her brain does a somersault. Don't worry, she won't hit you unless you tell her you wanted to do it— if you don't say anything and just give her the ol drive-by, she'll know it was from me.§!"

As it turns out, these folks like to fashion themselves as 'political influencers,' and 'prescribed geniuses.' Let's hash some details out.

A raider. A shithead. I've lived like it, too. If I'm being wholly honest, I don't know really if I regret it, either... But I can think of a few things that I do regret. I never treated you well. I spent more time dragging your mother through the dirt and greenlighting life-ruining bullshit that made money. \n\nI know you haven't forgiven me about Nancy. I haven't forgiven myself either.

On one hand, they're great at what they do— bastards can leap off a wall and hold onto a signpost like it's nothing. They're complete freaks, and they're even better hunters. With the amount of infants that up and die around here, you'd think we'd be out the wazoo in numbers— but no, it's just not that simple. Thought it was, and it seemed well and alright at first, but like everything else there was a caveat: boys and the Faerie growth serums did not go well at all. Maybe it was testosterone, maybe it was something else, but the little bastards became meaner than a raider hooked up on super psycho within weeks. \n\nIt was completely horrible. Had to decommission the entire generation and start again, this time with just girls. They were almost perfect, but having only fifty percent of every dying kid in the city be able to be used wasn't ideal. Not that we could do anything about it— it was just the way things went. Of course, we could always just start nabbing every baby, but the boys in the lab tell me that wouldn't go very well either."

One of the last male faeries, he'd escaped the purging of his generation and always on the verge of lashing out at the world. Pattywack was hoping she could show him how to hide and seek better by showing him how to be quiet and wait.\n\nThey were seeking another faerie, one hopefully patrolling on their own. In the darkling hours before dawn they found one, a shaggy haired and lumbering faerie dragging a gun behind her. Pattywack cupped her hands and loudly whispered from the alley “Psst, Sissy is here, come and play!” The other faerie looked up in surprise, her face hidden behind long dirty blonde hair, and lurched towards them. “Come and follow us!” Pattywack added as Twinkle twitched and glared out into the street with his one eye.\n\nA shout came from further down the street “Hey, BB where are you going?” The shaggy faerie stopped and looked back and forth from Pattywack and to the man coming down the road, a handler assigned to ensure she didn't wander off. As soon as they came into sight Twinkle hissed and charged out of the darkness to pounce upon him despite Pattywack's protests. BB started to wail, confused at the situation. Pattywack wasted no time, ushering BB away with soothing words and calling for Twinkle to leave the dead man."

They half shut the curtains again and looked back into the dim room, the temptation to close them fully and go back to grieving tugging at the young Chase's heart. After what felt like an age but in reality was half a minute, Frankie turned away from the shadows and opened the window wide.

Not that it was too small, there were plenty of people including actual friends of the Chase dynasty, but a number of the attendees seemed to have come for the sake of appearances judging by their bored expressions and brief words of condolences. Manitoban exiles, scientists from the Orphanage, and travelers from Stoon and Dundurn were among these cold attendees but standing out the most to Frankie was their own mother, Gloria Chase.\n\nShe sat near the front of it all, with a disdainful expression on her face, only beginning to pay some attention when Frankie stood to give a eulogy. Undeterred by the lukewarm crowd Frankie gave an impassioned speech in the name of their father, espousing all of his better traits and telling stories of some of his festival antics that got the crowd laughing in the end. Afterwards, as people began to filter out, Gloria made her way up to Frankie. “It was a good speech,” she said, the praise prompting her child to reach out for a hug. Gloria accepted, but added as they embraced “a better one than he deserved.”\n\nFrankie bit their tongue as they pulled away, responding only with a curt “Thanks mom.” Gloria left a moment later, leaving her child alone as the rest of the funeral emptied out."

Everyone in the society is heartbroken over it.” Before Frankie could thank her she pushed on “Really that's why I'm here. The White Birch Society would like to extend their friendship and support to you.”\n\n“I'm flattered, and don't get me wrong I'm glad to hear it.” Frankie took a seat, and gestured at a shelf of drinks that Miss Blanche helped herself to. “Why though, if I can ask?”\n\nShe took a drink of scotch before answering “Well dear old Maxwell was good to us, a real friend, and we think his child will need all the help we can give in these tough times. In particular we'd love to help you put a crosshair, “she pantomimed holding up a scoped rifle “on those mad folks in the Cabal. I quite doubt they're going to make life easy for you, rather the opposite and we've not gotten along well with them lately.”"

  nf_plt.24.t:0 "A HOPEful Conversation"
  nf_plt.24.d:0 "Frankie sat before HOPE's display, in the cushy chair their father had occupied many times. They'd been talking for hours about anything that came to mind; the faeries, events in Dundurn and Stoon, Gloria, managing Pleasantdale. More often than not though the conversation returned to Maxwell Chase.\n\nEventually Frankie asked “Did my dad talk about me much?”\n\nBrightening as she answered, HOPE said §B“Oh yes! At least once a week and more often sometimes. He would speak about how you were growing up or interactions that you'd had. At times he would say that you were a 'good kid'.”§!\n\nFrankie smiled “Good to know he didn't always forget about me. Did you like him HOPE?”\n\n§B“I did! He was my friend and good company. Maxwell also made it very easy for me to know what to do and when which is always helpful. Now that he is gone, I hope that I can be friends with you.”§! The eyes in her display twinkled as she answered, reminding Frankie of the stars."
  nf_plt.24.a:0 "§YMe too, Hope...§!"

  nf_plt.25.t:0 "An Old World Threat"
  nf_plt.25.d:0 "HOPE played the message for Frankie a second time, displaying a figure obscured in shadows introducing themself as a “friend within the rightful power structure” and offering to provide HOPE with much needed direction after the passing of Maxwell Chase. They referred to themselves as the CSIS and it was clear as day to the young Mx. Chase that they had the worst of intentions, hinting at a vague desire to “make things as they should be.”\n\nFrankie seethed in their father's chair, not only affronted at this attempt to corrupt HOPE towards some mystery plot but also at the implication this CSIS considered the Chase heir to be such a nonfactor that they'd be able to make such a bold move. In the end however Frankie let the anger go and said to HOPE “Thank you for showing me this, you're a good friend. We need to act fast now, see if you can figure out where the message came from.”"
  nf_plt.25.a:0 "How odd..."

  nf_plt.26.t:0 "Dealing with the CSIS"
  nf_plt.26.d:0 "HOPE had managed to trace back the source of the CSIS message, though not as quickly as Frankie had hoped. Once she did though, they'd wasted no time in gathering a group to storm the hideout it had been broadcasted from. That hideaway turned out to be somewhere within a shuttered storefront in the middle of nowhere, easy to overlook and far from settlements, with a faded old sign advertising general goods. It was locked up tight but Frankie had brought along two of the biggest faeries in Pleasantdale, who made short work of even the steel shutter.\n\nSmoke began to leak out of the building however as the shutter was battered down, and it was soon revealed that a fire must have swept through the place recently. Keeping their mouths covered they moved through the ash and nearly dead embers to find a previously hidden trapdoor leading downward. At the bottom was a chamber in which Frankie found burned out computers and servers, still giving off heat, as well as piles of debris and bits of charred paper. The place had been thoroughly cleaned out or trashed.\n\nFrankie wasn't exactly satisfied as they left the ruins, but decided that whatever the CSIS had been planning they'd decided to tuck in their tails and run rather than face up to any resistance. It would have to do."

  nf_plt.27.d:0 "§B“You've got an opportunity to change things. At the end of it all my head was too stuck up my ass to do anything about it. Things don't have to be so terrible in Pleasantdale.”§! Frankie switched off the recording; they knew it by heart at this point. As they pressed the button though and thought of the words that came next, Frankie started to cry. Tears of sorrow but also of happiness and catharsis.\n\nThey reflected on everything that had happened since they'd first heard his final words. Striking up a friendship with HOPE, regulating the Lucifers and reforming the Faerie Program, driving out the Cabal and CSIS, uniting the electorate and putting a stop to the bloody madness, even Gloria giving her reluctant support to their leadership. Frankie felt then in that moment that if their father had been there to see it all, that he'd bluster a bit and maybe try and take some of the credit but underneath it all he'd be impressed as hell.\n\nFrankie turned the tape back on and let it finish playing §B“And... hey kid, I believe in you. You didn't need to hear it from me, but... yeah. For what it may be worth... I love you.”§!\n\nThe tears continued to flow as the recording finished, Frankie missing him badly but sure that they'd made him proud. “I love you too.”"
  nf_plt.27.a:0 "§YRest easy, Dad.§!"

  nf_plt.29.t:0 "Mx Chases' Many Suitors"
  nf_plt.29.d:0 "Frankie sat in a quiet office, drink in hand and leaning back in the still cushy but fairly threadbare armchair that dominated the room. On the table next to them was a small pile of messages, sent from both the republicans of the south and the kingdom to the east. The letters were all quite cordial, politely requesting that the Pleasant Electorate aid them in their great struggle to either end or prolong the crown. Each describing the threat that the other posed to the region, and making arguments on how Frankie and the Electorate would benefit from an alliance.\n\nThe Kingdom had been a rival to the Electorate for as long as both had existed, and the republicans were keen to argue that a resurgent crown was an existential threat to its neighbours. That was true enough as Frankie saw it, but the Kingdom had its own proposals to make; guarantees of independence as well as a place of honour among Gunn's allies. Manitoba wanted something in return though, the delivery of Pariah Hawkmoon who had struck against the Crown more often than any other living soul in the Electorate.\n\nIt was not something to consider lightly; if Frankie picked the wrong side it could destroy everything they'd worked for and it was hard to say that either was entirely trustworthy. It was tempting to throw all the messages into the fire and leave Manitoba to whatever future lay ahead of it. The drink had been refilled and emptied twice before Frankie decided:"
  nf_plt.29.a:0 "The Crown would be a powerful friend."
  nf_plt.29.b:0 "The Kingdoms time was over."
  nf_plt.29.c:0 "The Electorate would stand alone."

  nf_plt.30.t:0 "Chancellor Frankie Chase"
  nf_plt.30.d:0 "Frankie took a couple halting steps up the stairs, steadying themself against the wall as they went. Their head was swimming, from a mix of drink and a day spent with barely a moment of peace to think within. They passed a mirror and stopped. Chancellor Frankie Chase stared back at them. How strange the days had become, Frankie thought.\n\nIt had been strange enough for them to throw the Electorate's lot in with Manitoba but to get a message back declaring Frankie a noble? Who could have pictured that? The young Chase was fairly certain it didn't actually mean much, but it hadn't stopped the White Birch Society from throwing their newly noble friend several parties to celebrate. It had gotten rather wild but Frankie had switched to Nuka-Maple partway through the festivities to keep from completely losing their head; they didn't need to follow in all their father's footsteps after all.\n\nLeaving the mirror behind, they made their way to the bedroom and sat on the edge of the mattress. At least it was a sign that Manitoba was sincere in their offer of friendship, it would have been an unlikely gift from a King plotting betrayal. Before they drifted off to sleep, staring into the dark, Frankie did have to admit to themself that Chancellor had kind of a nice ring to it."
  nf_plt.30.a:0 "The Noble Chase Dynasty"

  nf_plt.31.t:0 "Fairly Odd"
  nf_plt.31.d:0 "Frankie opened the door warily, the knocking on the other side had been both loud and manic. It was barely open a crack before a thin, ragged shoe forced it all the way open. On the other side stood a rail-thin man in a patched shirt and slacks, a loosely knotted tie dangling below cracked glasses. A toothy smile stretched across their narrow face and his hair was lank and greasy but his eyes were full of fire. In his hand was a long net with a number of unidentifiable gizmos attached. Tentatively Frankie asked “Can I help you?”\n\n“Yes! You can and you should help me. I’m told that you’re the local expert on faeries!” His face twitched violently as he nearly shouted the last word.\n\n“Umm, well I don’t know if I’m an expert. I’m not a scientist. But there should be a few just down at the corner that way.” Frankie gestured down the street towards a corner the faeries often patrolled. The man thanked Frankie, already dashing off down the road without a second look back. Shrugging, Frankie went back inside and took down a book from the shelf to try and relax. They’d barely gotten two sentences in when a hideous scream rang out from outside. Running outside and after it they found the odd man dead in the street, stood over by a grumbling faerie trying to rip itself free of the net that had been thrown over her head."
