  arb_supply_problems_desc:0 "Our unprepared and disorganised retreat into the North had many consequences, but the biggest problem is our lack of equipment. We were not equipped to act as an expedition, and few trained artisans and mechanics joined us in the revolt. Due to this, we struggle to maintain adequate supply. However, our soldiers relish getting their hands on any enemy equipment they can."
