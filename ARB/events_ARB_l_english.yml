  nf_arb.1.t:0 "Shooting My Shot"
  nf_arb.1.d:0 "The mercenary life is a hard one. Most people view you as a raider with a contract, and treat you just as well. All it takes is one bad contract to leave you face down in the dirt and snow. But, if you are tough enough, skilled enough, and lucky enough, you can make it big. My shot came when a few contracts came calling for poor saps who knew how to shoot a gun and follow orders. I didn’t ask too many questions, always a risk in doing so, but I had a good look over who was calling before I made my choice. And oh boy, I was glad I did."

Soon, I had enough caps to form my own group, and we became the best around. Nobody else could match us in quality, training, or skill. And it was all thanks to me, my hard work and my skill. Yet, people still treated us like dirt, and it pissed me off badly. So much, that when the Kingdom came calling for a mercenary band to help in its war against the rebelling Republic, I saw an opportunity to change that. Success would mean that I finally..."

I've lost almost everyone, and all I’ve got with me now are a handful of soldiers, and some irregulars and stupid farmers who can barely shoot! Now that I've made it up north, we should be able to hold. Hold out until help can come, and get us out of here."

  nf_arb.4.d:0 "The Arborg Junta is an army attempting to be a state. Filled with mercenaries, militias, and uneducated Manitoba loyalists, they can't sustain themselves with what land they have. With the hostile Three Rivers to the south, the Junta scrapes by with imports from Manitoba over the often frozen water. If not for the iron hand of O’Brien keeping the military together as a threat, they would surely have collapsed. Nevertheless, they have a job to do, and if they wish to reclaim the Republic for the crown, they need to rearm, reorganise, and resupply."

  nf_arb.5.t:0 "A Message from Arborg"
  nf_arb.5.d:0 "We have received a message from the Arborg Junta, in which they express their willingness to support us in the ongoing civil war. Although the specifics of their support remain unclear, it is likely that they will provide us with either currency or equipment. Regardless, we can ensure that only we will have access to their mercenary forces and soldiers.\n\nHowever, there is a catch. Arborg has requested a shipment of weaponry as a condition for confirming the deal. Despite our attempts to negotiate, they seem unwilling to budge on this particular demand.\n\nBefore we make a decision, we need to weigh the benefits of Arborg's support against the cost of providing them with weapons. It's important to consider how their assistance could tip the scales in our favor, and whether the potential outcome of the civil war justifies the transfer of arms."

  nf_arb.6.d:0 "Our loyalty to the King during his time of need has not gone unnoticed, and we are to be rewarded for our efforts. [BRA.GetLeader] and his advisors have proposed several options for how we may be rewarded.\n\nOne option is to grant trappers the right to come to our territories and hunt for furs. In exchange for this privilege, the taxes collected from these trappers would be given to us, which could significantly boost our economy. This option has the potential to create a new industry within our territory, providing jobs and opportunities for our people.\n\nThe other option is for the Kingdom to bestow upon us a ceremonial gift of resources. The specifics of this gift are still being discussed, but the ceremony and tradition inherent in the bestowment would be appreciated by many monarchists within our territory. The gift would likely be of significant symbolic value, and could serve as a tangible representation of our loyalty to the King.\n\nBefore making a decision, we should carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of each option. Granting trappers the right to hunt within our territories could lead to increased competition for resources and potential conflicts with local trappers. On the other hand, a ceremonial gift may not have any immediate economic benefits, but could bolster our reputation and strengthen our ties with the Kingdom."

  nf_arb.7.d:0 "Yorkton has expressed gratitude for the aid that we have been providing and wishes to compensate us properly for our valuable efforts. To show his appreciation, he has proposed several potential rewards for us to consider.\n\nOne option that he has suggested is to teach our manufacturers to develop and produce weapons faster and more efficiently. Yorkton recognizes the unparalleled experience of Langenburg in this regard and believes that sharing this knowledge with us could significantly improve our military capabilities. This option could provide us with a significant advantage in the ongoing conflict and would likely result in long-term benefits for our military.\n\nThe other option that Yorkton has presented is to allow his propaganda machine to operate within our borders. This would involve disseminating information to our people to motivate them to further support our military efforts. Additionally, projections suggest that this could lead to an increase in donations of scrap metal, which could provide a significant boost to our industrial capacity.\n\nBefore making a decision, we should weigh the benefits of each option. Learning from Langenburg's expertise could enhance our military capabilities and positively impact our manufacturing sector. Additionally, allowing Yorkton's propaganda machine to operate within our borders could bring enthusiasm for the wars which we inevitably must fight."

  nf_arb.8.d:0 "The recent revolt in Yorkton has come to an end, and we were fortunate enough to have supported the winning side. Our contributions played a significant role in their victory, and we have been receiving numerous delegations from the victors expressing their gratitude for our support in the war.\n\nThe victors have assured us of our status and prominence in the new Manitoban society that is developing, recognizing the significant contributions that we have made towards their success. Our territory has become an important topic of discussion in even the highest circles of the Kingdom, cementing our position as a key player in regional politics.\n\nThe impact of our support in the war has been significant, with the victors recognizing our contributions as valuable and essential to their success. As a result, we have gained considerable influence in the new society that is developing, with many seeking our advice and guidance on matters of governance and politics.\n\nThis newfound prominence has been a source of pride for us, and we have already begun to see the benefits of our support in the war. We must now work to ensure that we continue to maintain our position and influence in the new society, and that we leverage our newfound status to secure the best possible outcomes for our people and our territory.\n\nIt feels good."

Our mistake is likely to have significant repercussions, damaging our legitimacy and influence in the region for years to come.\n\nOur misstep has left us in a precarious position, with many questioning our judgment and reliability. The victors, in particular, are unlikely to forget our mistake anytime soon, and we must work hard to prove ourselves and regain their trust.\n\nRebuilding our reputation is going to be a long and difficult process, requiring significant effort and resources. We must take immediate action to repair the damage that has been done and demonstrate our commitment to the new order that is emerging."

  nf_arb.11.d:0 "Our Wasteland Dogs have returned early from their expedition, missing part of their number and most of their supplies. According to their commander, they were attacked at night while resting near a frozen lake by Icelurks. They ambushed the camp and dragged away a few soldiers, and before our troops could respond, an Icelurk Queen emerged from the ice and destroyed their supplies. They barely fought her off before trudging their way back home, not having nearly enough food and ammunition to attempt to continue on. Might take a few days to gather enough supplies to send out another expedition."

  nf_arb.12.d:0 "The black spires of smoke and flame can be seen all across the Arborg-Republic border, and the smell of death permeates the air downwind. The sun, normally a pale yellow, was now red through the ashen streams. The small number of survivors who managed to flee their burning homes quickly spread the news of what happened, and with it, fear. Over the night, a raiding force from the Junta crossed the border unseen, and began to sack every settlement they could find. Homes were burnt, people were slaughtered, and their remains were left to freeze on the cracked frozen ground. Along the entire border rose an endless line of smoke and fire, showing the wrath of the Junta. Word spread quickly come morning, and soon a wave of people began to flee the border region, fearing for their lives. Even those within the lands of the Junta began to vacate the area, out of fear of Republican reprisals. Tensions are flaring, and soon open warfare may once again blight the North."

Its pursuers quickly end their chase, watching as the truck of stolen weapons and supplies slowly vanishes from sight. Just before the break of dawn, a small force of Arborg mercenaries stowed over the border and made their way to a local garrison. Exploiting the Republic troops' exhaustion, they quickly neutralise the guards before robbing the place blind. Attempting to leave in a stolen truck, the mercenaries drive straight into a Republican relief force, which quickly gives chase. The latest in a series of raids, tensions continue to grow between the two states, with more and more Republic soldiers arriving to reinforce their frontier with the Junta. All know that the war is coming, it's only a matter of when."

  nf_arb.14.t:0 "Ghoul Horde"
  nf_arb.14.d:0 "A small group of our Wasteland Dogs have returned early from their expedition, missing a lot of their number but still having most of their supplies. From what we can piece together from the survivors, they were setting up camp inside an old Pre-War building when a section of the floor collapsed, leading into an old survival bunker. The noise awakened a feral Ghoul horde located in the bunker, who swarmed their camp and killed most of their group. A few managed to escape, hiding while the horde flooded out and dispersed into the town, before gathering their supplies and heading home. It's gonna take a while to get the manpower to send out another expedition."

  nf_arb.15.d:0 "O’Brien looked down at the valley through his binoculars, observing the cornered raiders prepare and build defences to keep his forces out, their back to the giant stone wall of a pre-war dam. It had been a hard campaign to push the Dammed out of the north, but taking out these raider bastards felt good to him. His men milled around behind him, anticipating what was to come. A radio buzzed to life on his belt. It was time. He picked up the radio and brought it to his face. \n\n"Drown the rats."\n\nA moment's silence, shattered by a series of explosions running up the dam's surface. Rubble rained down on the raiders, sending them scrambling for cover, as the monument to the old world collapsed under the weight of the river behind it. Even from his position high above the valley, O’Brien could hear the crashing sound of the water as it swept through the Dammed camp, sending stone and bodies tumbling away as the river reasserted itself. Before long, it was over, no sign of the camp or the raiders left in the flowing blue waters. O’Brien turned to face his troops, before firing a shot into the air.\n\n"Double rations for everyone!""

  nf_arb.16.d:0 "O’Brien read the latest report that had been delivered to him, leaning back on his chair with his boots on the desk. New recruits, production reports, scouting findings, and, what really caught his eye, tax reports. He let out a low whistle as he saw the total number of caps the locals were bringing in, exponentially higher than his own paycheck. The Kingdom is certainly gonna love these numbers. He tosses the paper aside and leans back a bit more, his hands behind his head. He was living the life. Probably the best job he had ever taken in his career.\n\n"Shame it has to end..."\n\nO’Brien frowns slightly at the thought of his contract ending. What to do then? The Kingdom probably won't have much use for him after that, and though he was loath to admit it, he was getting on in life. He stared up at the ceiling, a new thought entering his mind. He could just take the land for himself. It’s not like the Kingdom would have the means to stop him. He let the thought stew for a bit.\n\n"Maybe... maybe...""

This is a momentous occasion, not just for Angers but for the entire Kingdom of Manitoba. Celebrations have erupted across the Duchy and beyond, as people rejoice in the restoration of a legacy long thought dead.\n\nWhile our success has not been without its challenges, we have shown our unwavering devotion and loyalty to the Kingdom's cause. By restoring the Duchy of Angers, we have demonstrated our commitment to building a stronger and more united Kingdom.\n\nOur efforts have not gone unnoticed, and the Kingdom has recognized our contributions by granting us the title of "The Eastern Marches". This title signifies our important position on the Kingdom's eastern border and our crucial role in defending the Kingdom from external threats.\n\nThis is a great day not just for Angers, but for the Kingdom as a whole. With the restoration of the Duchy, we can now begin to integrate more fully into the Kingdom and work towards a brighter future together. We will continue to build on our successes and work towards a stronger and more prosperous Kingdom for all its citizens."

  nf_arb.18.d:0 "O’Brien stood in the lobby of the capitol building in Arborg, hearing the muffled cheers of the crowd outside. He adjusted his shirt collar and shifted awkwardly, not used to being dressed so well. This was a special occasion, however. After years of work, his contract was complete. He had taken the north back for the Kingdom, and now the new Duke of Arborg had arrived to relieve him of his duty. The door unlocked, and in walked Duke Tobias, flanked by two Mounties from the Kingdom. O’Brien stands up straight, returning a solute from the two Mounties, before the Duke walks forward to shake his hand.\n\n"O’Brien, I presume? Glad to finally make your acquaintance. We would not be here today if not for your actions and that of your company. The Kingdom thanks you greatly."\n\nO’Brien returns the hand shake, hoping his smile didn’t look as forced as it felt. "Another job well done, that's what I always say, Sir."\n\nTobias laughs and clasps O’Briens shoulder.\n\n"Glad to hear it, my good man. I know you have already received your final payment, but please, take this from me personally."\n\nHe hands O’Brien a heavy purse of caps, before moving past him to ascend the balcony. Honestly, he didn’t know what to think, or what to do. He just stared at the purse as he walked out the back door."

At first we ignored him, until we saw the remnants of the Wasteland Dogs emblem on his rags. Bringing him inside, we attempted to calm him down and hear his story, but all we could piece together was something about some woods the expedition made camp in, and that something had torn them apart. He wouldn't, or couldn't, say what it was, and just pointed at an area north of Langenburg on the map. Whatever's there is dangerous, and we will make sure all our future expeditions avoid it."

  nf_arb.20.a:0 "Three cheers for the soon to be victors!"

  nf_arb.21.t:0 "Offer of Support Rejected"
  nf_arb.21.d:0 "Those fools at [FROM.GetName] have made the unwise choice of rejected our offer of aid, believing that they can deal with this war on their own. A rather foolish belief, but one that we can't sway. What we can do instead is reevaluate our options. Perhaps their competitor would be more amenable to a deal? Or perhaps we should just open our markets to both sides and let the war play itself out? While this is an obstacle, it is by no means a dead end."

  nf_arb.22.t:0 "The Northern Peoples"
  nf_arb.22.d:0 "We’ve received a contract from the Kingdom to send an expedition north, to make contact with the Nunavut people. Job is to establish contact and relations with them, and chart a path between the Kingdom’s land and theirs, for potential future trade. We gotta be careful though, they know these frozen lands better than anyone else, and could easily ambush us on the snow or ice, and rumour has it that they don't take kindly to outsiders. Our Wasteland Dogs, however, are the best in the business. They will get the job done."

After arriving in Nunavut land and setting up camp, our troops awoke to find themselves surrounded by Nunavut troops, somehow remaining completely undetected by all our sentries. Thankfully, they were able to de-escalate the situation, and make contact with the Nunavut commander in the area. After a short discussion and a show of good will, our men were allowed to leave with a letter inviting diplomats from the Kingdom for discussion.

The purpose of their mission was to find valuable resources and technology to aid their regime and improve their relations with us.\n\nArborg has offered these findings to us as a gift, in the hopes of strengthening our opinion of them and their own regime.

Rumour has it that he controls an army of Rad-Roaches and is running amok, answering to no one. Kingdom wants Wasteland Dogs to determine if Three Rivers has any plans to ally with him in the coming war, and if so, prevent that. It's an odd job, but our troops should get it done.

The man is absolutely mad and attacks anyone who tries to get close to him. And that's where the bad news comes in. That army of Rad-Roaches he has is a serious threat. There were thousands of the things, and our men barely made it out of there. He may not threaten the Kingdom now, but it would be smart to keep an eye on him."

Rumour has it that a group of Power Armoured soldiers have arrived in Montana in force, and began setting up shop. The Kingdom is worried, downright scared if you ask me, and wants us to investigate who they are and ascertain any threat they may pose. This may be a tough one. If they are as well armoured as rumour says, our troops better be careful, lest they get wiped out."

From what we could gather from a distance, they are part of some sort of military group from the American Midwest.

He groans and rolls over, falling off the couch he had passed out on and knocking over some empty bottles. Cursing, O’Brien manages to get his feet under him and walk to the bathroom, stepping over the sleeping bodies of his soldiers, all drunk out of their minds. Gripping the sink, he stares into the dirty mirror, trying to remember the events of the last few days. Through the still pounding headache and the smell of spilled alcohol, O’Brien recalls their party, celebrating their victory of the Republic. No... not their victory. His victory. He smiles and wipes the mirror clear. He still had it, the fire that helped him make his name in the mercenary world. It was that fire that got him hired by the Kingdom, and that fire that led them to survive in Arborg. Maybe he didn't have to retire after this job. O’Brien scratched his beard and fixed his hair. Nah, he thought, I can keep going. After all..."

Battle scars left by the monarchist people who had not been too happy about his refusal to submit the land to the Kingdom. Although his company had been quick in securing Arborg and the surrounding areas, rebels still rose up and attempted to force them out of the city. Naturally, they were crushed, though O’Brien was a bit annoyed at the damage they had caused. He sipped from his flask, looking towards the horizon as the moonlight reflected off the buildings. The Kingdom could try and come to take back their land, but he knew that if they were able to, he would have never been hired. O’Brien smiles at that thought. No, the Kingdom was helpless to stop him, and now all the wealth of Arborg was his, far more than the pocket change he was being paid before. He raised his flask into the air, and gave a toast."

This had led to Tanner picking up some of King Gunn's administrative duties, the amount increasing ever so steadily. While he'd prefer to be in the field rather than pencil pushing, in the end it made the King's day easier; and for that he was more than willing. Unfortunately, it meant that sometimes Tanner would have to be the bearer of bad news, and he knew this event would be more frustrating for the king. With a gentle knock—received with a polite response—he entered Gunn's room and braced himself.\n\n"Tanner, I hope you find yourself well today?" Gunn asked politely, seemingly preoccupied as he stared out the window.\n\n"Not exactly, Sire, things have taken a rather unsavoury turn as of late," Tanner said quietly.\n\n"When have they ever gone well for us?" Gunn muttered bitterly.\n\n'Like a bandaid,' Tanner thought to himself. "Yes Sire, I hate to bring you more unfortunate news but it seems—" Tanner hesitated. "It seems that O'Brien has seen fit to betray us; they've formally declared their independence from the Monarchy." He winced slightly, preparing for the king's response. Gunn hesitated for a moment, looking at Tanner with a face of shock which quickly turned to full blown rage.\n\n"How dare he!?" Gunn erupted, slamming his fist on the table, "after all the funding we provided him, the equipment! He sees fit to cut ties with us?! I should have him hung! Drawn and quartered! That vile fiend! He will pay for this," Gunn huffed. He panted loudly before flopping back down in his seat. His head fell into his hands, breathing out a sigh. "When are we ever going to catch a break Tanner?" Gunn asked, desperation in his voice.\n\nTanner wanted nothing more than to comfort him, to tell him that it would all be okay. It was pointless.

He has declared a revolt, and has ordered every patriotic citizen to join his cause. While this cuts off any potential supply shipments from Manitoba, it's not without benefits to us...\n\nWe can use this opportunity to really prove our loyalty to the Crown. If we back the winning side, they are sure to shower us with praises and rewards, and be far more willing to send support our way. We might also be able to supply weapons and equipment to one or both sides - nothing like a quick war for a quick buck.\n\nHowever, we must also exercise caution.

The fall of the Kingdom had been a huge shock to not only the locals, but to O’Brien himself, his pay suddenly cut off. However, he had been quick to act, declaring himself the head of the lands of Arborg as its own state. His company was quickly able to secure the land and town, but they were not without resistance. Some pro-monarchist tried to protest his actions, though to what end was beyond him. He sipped from his flask, looking towards the horizon as the moonlight reflected off the buildings. It was a nice place, and he already knew how wealthy it was. O’Brien smiled briefly as an entertaining thought entered his mind. For the first time in his mercenary career, he was glad his employer died while he was on the job. Now it was all his, to set him and his company up for life. He raised his flask into the air, and gave a toast."

Job is to head to the Electorate and investigate rumours that the town of Pleasantdale has its hands on some powerful Old-World American tech. Kingdom wants us to investigate these claims, and, if possible, get our hands on some of it. Now, we gotta be extra careful here, Kingdom doesn't want to start a conflict with Pleasantdale or the other Electorals, especially since much of Pleasantdale’s population came from the Kingdom, and could be a good ally in the future. As long as we keep our heads straight, we should avoid any issue."

  nf_arb.38.d:0 "Operation Pleasant Day, Commanders log, entry 1.\n\nWe have arrived in Pleasantdale. Journey here was uneventful, just a few Ferals and animals that tried their luck against the caravan. No Raiders this time, probably saw our gear and backed off. This place gives me the creeps. Everything is so clean and tidy, like one of those pre-war postcards, and it just feels unnatural. All locals are too friendly, and seem to have no idea what it's like to live out in the wasteland, it’s unnerving. And those faeries... Those weird things have been following us the whole time we have been here, watching us with those glowing eyes. I hope that they weren't the reason the Kingdom sent us here, cause I'll be damned if I have to look at those things ever again.\n\nWe camped outside the town in order to avoid any issues with the locals, and I only brought a few men with me armed with pistols, to show we don't mean any harm. Yet, nobody officially would come and meet with us. From what we could gather, the Mayor hadn't shown his face in ages, and any attempt to contact him was met with silence. I was about to call it there and head back to camp when one of those Faery things came up to me and directed us to follow it. It refused to say where we were going or who sent it, but we didn’t have any other options to complete our objective here, so we followed it to a small house near the back of the town. \n\nWhen we arrived at the house, the Faery left and a big screen turned on, showing the flickery image of a woman on it. The woman called herself HOPE, and said she wanted to help us. After questioning her, I learnt that she was some sort of robot intelligence, and she had some involvement in the Faery program here in Pleasantdale. I don't fully trust her, but she has offered to lead us to some places with other pre-war tech we can bring back to the Kingdom. If it means I get the job done, I'll see what she has to offer."

  nf_arb.39.d:0 "Operation Pleasant Day, Commanders log, entry 6\n\nHOPE has led us to yet another pre-war location with some fancy tech. I have to admit, despite my apprehension in trusting her, she has been extremely useful. This has been the 4th location she has led us to, filled with enough supplies to keep us stocked and to bring back home, as well as the tech within. The Kingdom should be happy, and that means we get paid. Another successful job completed by the Wasteland Dogs.\n\nThough I must confess, some of the technology HOPE has brought us to seems a bit less than useful. Automatic coffee makers, robot floor sweepers, hands off moustache groomer. It all seems a bit old-world luxury, though I guess the Kingdoms elite would take a liking to them. Still, I was hoping to find something we could use against the Republic, help the Boss win the war without a bunch of us dying. Maybe we can strap more blades to the automatic lawn mower. \n\nI asked HOPE, using that modified pip-boy she gave me back in Pleasantdale, if she could take us to something a bit more substantial. She said there was one final place we can scavenge, something really big from before the war. She called it MANIFEST North, a huge pre-war experiment that would change society forever. I see no reason to doubt her claims now."

  nf_arb.40.d:0 "“What is this place?”\n\nThe light of the Pip-Boy illuminated the ruined signage on the wall, its meaning indecipherable and lost to time. The Commander looked around the room, a lobby of sorts, while his men searched around for anything useful. A cheerful voice responded from the Pip-Boy.\n\n§M“This is the location of MANIFEST. It shall help and care for humanity, allowing it to prosper.”§!\n\nThe Commander sighed, as that’s what the AI had said the last three times he had asked her. Nevermind, he thought, the building was huge and looked scientific. Probably had a bunch of supplies they could take back to the Kingdom, and finally end this expedition. It had gone on much longer than anticipated, but the haul had been good. He was about to call out to his men when HOPE spoke again.\n\n§M“Please head into the lower chamber of the facility with your men. All of you will be needed.”§!\n\nThe Commander looked down at the device on his wrist, confused at the sudden request, but HOPE had led them true so far, and he had no reason to doubt her instruction. Calling out to his troops, they made their way down a dark stairwell, littered with debris and dark stains. The lights were shorted out, but a dim light was emanating from the doorway below. As they entered the room, they saw enclosed pods with tubes flowing out of them, dozens of them in a grid pattern. Some appeared to be broken, with a dark stain leading from them into vents and holes. The troops murmured uneasily. HOPE spoke again.\n\n§M“Please connect me to the terminal, Commander.”§!\n\nHe was unsure, his instinct told him that this room was dangerous, but he reasoned that nothing could get the drop on them in this enclosed space. He connected the Pip-Boy into the terminal, and watched as it flickered to life and began showing a stream of code. A voice then echoed around the room, as glass screens rose up and separated the Commander from his troops.\n\n§M“MANIFEST online.”§!"

  nf_arb.41.t:0 "For the Good of Mankind"
  nf_arb.41.d:0 "§M“Please enter the pods to resume the experiment immediately.”§!\n\nThe troops banged on the glass in an attempt to free themselves, but the tempered screens merely reflected their blows. The voice repeated its demand, as the unbroken pods opened to reveal the atrophied and mutated remains of people inside them. The troops began to panic, as the bodies inside the pods began to stir and move, all while MANIFEST repeated its demands. The Commander turned to the Pip-Boy.\n\n“HOPE, what is this? Shut it down, now!”\n\n§M“The experiment must be complete. MANIFEST will provide and care for all of humanity. No longer will humanity have to work or struggle. MANIFEST will provide.”§!\n\nThe Commander desperately looked at the terminal in an attempt to find a way to stop the awakened AI. The stream of code was endless, cycling far too fast to read or alter. The trapped soldiers panicked more, some firing at the mutated creatures, while others fought off robot arms attempting to place them into the pods.\n\n§M“The experiment must be complete. MANIFEST will provide. MANIFEST will provide.”§!\n\nThe troops began to scream in terror, while the voice of MANIFEST continued to vibrate around the chamber. The Commander had hesitated long enough. Tearing out the Pip-Boy cable, he unloaded his weapon into the terminal, ignoring the protesting cries of HOPE. The voice of MANIFEST began to slur and stutter, the lights in the room flickering and sparking. The glass screens began to slide down, allowing the troops to free themselves and kill the last of the mutated creatures. Fleeing from the building, HOPE spoke once again with more rage than the Commander thought possible for a machine.\n\n§M“Why? MANIFEST would have saved humanity. Protected it at all times. You would have been happy and cared for. Why ruin the experiment, after centuries of planning and waiting. Why!”§!\n\nThe Commander ignored her cries, undoing the straps on his wrist and letting the Pip-Boy fall to the floor. As they left the building, all that could be heard was HOPE’s cries of anguish."
