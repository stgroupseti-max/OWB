  arb_more_than_guns:0 "More than Guns"
  arb_more_than_guns_desc:0 "Guns and swords aren't good enough - after all, the most powerful armies of the prewar world built mighty tanks and battleships as well.

  arb_reform_unit_doctrine:0 "Reform Unit Doctrine"
  arb_reform_unit_doctrine_desc:0 "A proper, well functioning army is not simply a bunch of guys with weapons. The best armies integrate logistical companies, field hospitals, demolitions teams and more. We should look into integrating support companies and reforming our doctrine."

  arb_declare_duchy_restored_desc:0 "With the land of the Dammed now under our control, we have the full territory of the former Duchy of Angers. By forming ourselves into the Eastern Marches we will prove to Manitoba and the world that Angers is back."

  arb_manitoban_business:0 "Business From the Kingdom"
  arb_manitoban_business_desc:0 "By attracting businesses from Manitoba, we can strengthen our admittedly weak local economy. This may have the consequence of making us more dependant on Manitoba, but surely that won't be any problem."

  arb_incite_monarchist_revolts_desc:0 "There are still plenty of monarchists in the land of Three Rivers. Many of them simply want to keep their heads down and live quiet lives, but if we show them there's a chance of victory than many of them will rise up in revolt."

  arb_play_them_off:0 "Play Them Against Each Other"
  arb_play_them_off_desc:0 "We should begin to expand our shipments to each of the factions in this revolt. The more aid we give them, the longer the war takes, and the more money we can rake in. It's a win-win situation!"
