  DES_ROGUE_RANGER_NAME: "The Rogue Ranger"
  DES_ROGUE_RANGER_DESC: "§R"The seventy-first, was the year. The Rangers one, together, near.\nWealth and power, they were blessed. Yet evil's might did not rest.\nThrough the wasteland, wickedness spread. Horrors and fear, innocents bled.\nAbigail wept, were they inept? Here they slept, while wickedness crept!\nBy her own rite, she brought a fight. Wickedness feared her, Rogue Ranger's might"§!\n\n2271 was the year that the NCR and Desert Rangers unified into a single organization, bent on protecting the best interests of the people of the wasteland.\nAt least, some would say.\n\nFor Abigail Lee, that was something she could never abide by. To her, the idea that the Desert Rangers would surrender their sovereignty, that they would turn a blind eye to any innocent just based on their nationality, was repulsive.\nOver time, she began to become emboldened by her views as she watched as innocents died in Brotherhood raids deep into NCR territory, how raiders continued probing into the frontiers of the NCR’s territory, as cities like Shady Sands and New Reno turned a blind eye to the evils of the world.\n\nTaking on the mantle of the Rogue Ranger--the Ranger that defied the Unification Treaty and sought to stand by her ideals, no matter what--Abigail gathered a small group of fellow rangers and travelled to the wasteland of Esmeralda, hoping to make a difference in a way that she couldn’t under the banner of a corrupt government."

  #Advisor Descriptions
  DES_charming_jack_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§1"Never attempt to win by force what can be won by deception."§!\n\nCharming Jack had worked for many people, but none had paid as well as the NCR. He saw politicians rise and fall, neighboring governments crumble, and rowdy barons suffer unfortunate accidents. It was work that made him very wealthy but never left him feeling particularly satisfied.\n\nFollowing Abigail Lee was more of a passion project. Jack had spent many years neck-deep in the corrupted mire that was NCR politics. When he heard murmurs about a band of Rangers who had rejected unification to bring their own justice to the wastelands, he quickly gathered the few things he needed and headed for Ranger Citadel. Now Jack works tirelessly to cover the Rogue Ranger's weak points. Where she can be a hammer, he can be a knife, gathering intel on their neighbors and exploiting weaknesses outside the battlefield. The Rangers must be experts at all forms of combat, so political espionage should come naturally, no?\n\nEven while the fighting in Arizona heats up, Jack's attention will never leave the bear slumbering to the east. Whether his former employer becomes a friend or a foe, Charming Jack will be ready."
  DES_scribe_theresa_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§9"My thirst for knowledge cannot be quenched with caps."§!\n\nScribe Brown, caught in a Lost Hills raid on a Cultist gathering, was given an option many before her were provided: Be sent out on a research mission for pseudo-exile or be killed by the Circle of Steel. Seeing as her thirst for knowledge had gotten her into this mess, she decided to venture to the long-lost Guardians to record their history and attempt to guide them back to the codex.\n\nHer mission was cut short by a Ranger conquest, and in the fog of war, she managed to hitch a ride with the Rangers, transforming her mission from observation to active exploration for lost knowledge. Although unsanctioned by Lost Hills, there's not much they can do from their besieged bunkers to a woman they had exiled.\n\nThe Rangers, for their part, cautiously welcomed the Tin Woman into their libraries and field research teams. Her future will surely be marked with boredom, low-quality tech salvage, and fixing laser rifles. But at least it beats being dead."
  DES_kai_cooke_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§G"Put it on the tab of Abigail Lee!"§!\n\nKai is a mechanic with a lineage longer than that of the wasteland itself, and upon her father's death when the title of Head Mechanic passed to her, she vowed that under her watch, no bolt would go untightened. When the NCR came knocking, she could tell it was a scrap heap even her father couldn't fix, so she stayed the course; despite how low the Rangers fell, Kai was there to fix them back up.\n\nAfter every lost settlement, Kai steeled her resolve ever more, hoping she could stem the desperation until the Rangers were back on their feet. Only those closest to her truly knew the weight of the despair she burdened, and often those closest was a bottle of whatever liquor was cheapest and whichever rookie mechanic was roped into helping her off her bender.\n\nSo when Abigail announced the renewed plans to secure back Nevada, Kai jumped head first into it—meticulously planning the exact placement of every nut and calculating the weight of the soldering wire by hand. Her optimism was a relief to both the Mechanic Corp and Barmaids alike."
  DES_jane_maddocks_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§8"If you really want Blast Radius, put in a request for the next shipment, and I'll see what I can do."§!\n\nBeing a smuggler is often a thankless task... No, it's even worse than that; in one ear, you'll hear a Ranger complaining about undue attention; in the other, that same Ranger will be asking for extra rum rations. It's often said you can't please everyone, but to Jane, it seems you usually can't please anyone.\n\nBut as much as she or the Rangers will moan, and they often do; they all know that without her, the Rangers would often be in positions of complete disarray. Supply was a tactic in the war back before plasma was wielded, and that surely won't change due to a few lousy nuclear bombs.\n\nAlways the busy bee, Jane fears the day she's no longer needed; luckily, she doesn't have much time to daydream with all the ridiculous requests she has to deny nearly constantly.\n\nI mean, really, a Fat Man?"
  DES_rogue_ranger_army_chief_desc:0 "§R"The criminals who came with fear were all too sly. The people they terrorized surely did cry...\n\nThe innocent who didn't resist were tolled. Those who did were broken, robbed, and sold...\n\nOne day the fort upon the hill received a call. Out came the soldiers to bring them to crawl...\n\nThe soldiers did ride, with guns at their side, bolstered by pride, all that stood before them surely died...\n\nAnd for protecting those strangers, from all of the dangers, they were dubbed the §YDesert Rangers§!..."§!\n\nThey used to say that every shadow in Arizona has a Ranger in it, waiting for a reckless drunk or an overly handsy scumbag to cross their path. The people respected the Rangers because the Rangers were the only thing keeping their small communities safe. Evil was able to thrive once the Rangers left for California, letting raiders and armored lunatics galavant from town to town. However, the time for corruption and chaos is over. The Rogue Ranger has defeated her internal and external foes, and the sheriff has returned to her post. It is time for the dastardly to feel fear once again."
  DES_rogue_ranger_high_command_desc:0 "§R"One riot, one Ranger."§!\n\nIt is said that the Rogue Ranger once tracked Zygore the Hog across 100 miles of open desert to gut him in front of his followers. The evil that the Rangers face is far more extensive and more dangerous than any they have before, but it is the Rogue Ranger's enemies who should be afraid. Nothing will stand between the Rogue Ranger and justice across any terrain, through any battle, and during any weather."
  DES_snake_vargas_country_leader:0 "§Y"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."§!\n\nBeing the original signatory for the Rangers during the Ranger Unification Treaty, he had initially retired from active duty to the NCR town of Sac City when tales of the Rogue Rangers first reached him. Well aware of the danger Abigail posed, the mockery her acts of resistance made of the noble cause the Rangers once stood for, Snake Vargas took up his old mantel and the battered old cowboy hat with the gold star once more.\n\nHernán 'Snake' Vargas is a capable Ranger in every aspect. He earned his nickname, Snake, for being a magnet for snakebites - and surviving them every time. Another explanation is that Vargas was so calm under pressure as to seem cold-blooded. After his legendary showdown with Abigail Lee, Vargas walks with a cane, but he is far from helpless; with his sharp wit and seemingly endless wealth of knowledge, he now leads his iteration of the Desert Rangers from the rebuilt Ranger Station.\n\nVargas is a legend among Rangers, both for his achievements as a field Ranger and a commander, however amongst the men and women under his command are many of those that opposed his decision to unify the Rangers with the NCR. For now, they follow his orders, but their loyalty to the Ranger cause remains to be tested, and while Vargas remains adamant in his beliefs that they will come around, the revolver with numerous barrel notches and pearl grips is kept in immaculate condition, just in case."
  DES_snake_vargas_army_chief_desc:0 "§Y"The flame of civilization must not be snuffed out!"§!\n\nWith Snake in charge of the Ranger's armed forces, he can finally bring the organization back and renew training for their Veteran Rangers. His reforms will shape the Rangers into an elite force surpassing even the NCR Rangers in strength.\n\nSoon, the fine men of both the Republic and the Rangers will be marching over the Colorado River and seizing what was taken from them. No matter where you are, the Rangers will lay roots and grow a community that can never be uprooted."
  DES_snake_vargas_high_command_desc:0 "§Y"I was a golden boy back home. Not for the gun skills I've since grown famous for - I didn't have those yet - but for my talents as a medic, which I learned at my mother's knee, she being the only doctor in town."§!\n\nSince his elevation to Ranger General, Vargas occasionally takes more of a back seat to things, acting as a Dispatcher giving out new missions to Rangers and authorizing field promotions. When he isn't doing either, he likes to check in on Rangers in the field and tell them stories of his days back east. And the stories he has to tell are numerous...\n\n'If you could shoot, understand orders, and follow them, that was good enough.'\n\n'I met my future squadmates pretty early in the training program, each with a sillier name than the last - §LAngela Deth§!, §tHell Razor§! and §2Thrasher§!. Honestly, we didn't get along that well at first.'\n\n'For a while, the four of us just lived the daily grind of the Desert Ranger - scouting and foraging missions, patrolling our territory, and checking in on the towns and farms under our protection, but then, way before we were ready, something serious came along. It started as just another patrol, making the rounds to Highpool and Ag Center...'\n\nIt might have been boring. There may not have been enough fighting, but that's what real life is like. It might not be interesting, but there's always more to a story than they won and then moved to a new home."
  DES_rusty_shackleford_army_chief_desc:0 "§Y"No man in the wrong can stand up against a fellow that's in the right and keeps on a-comin'."§!\n\nRusty Shackleford lived in Texas for most of his life and was raised believing Texas was the world's greatest place left. He was a member of the Texas Rangers, an organization that has existed since the 19th century. He would also see their destruction at the hands of Attis’ army. Once the Rangers were gone, he left on a ship to California, hoping to start a new life in San Francisco. He would find the Shi’s technology and culture overwhelming when again he left, hoping to create a new life. He would find the Rangers and join them, telling them of his time serving in Texas. His stories of having all he knew destroyed by an unknown threat were all too familiar to the Rangers, having seen the rise and fall of the Master and Enclave. People found him amusing and began imitating his accent and style.\n\nSupport for him grew to a point where Texas Company was formed, with Rusty Shackleford at the center. Over time, Texas Company grew in recognition, their flashy persona making them celebrities within the NCR. It’d turned from an honest group of hardened soldiers into a traveling act around California. Despite their great reception, Ranger's high command was not happy. They were starting to make the Rangers look like a joke, and it was decided to dissolve the company and reassign all its men to different posts.\n\nTexas Company became just a memory, and with no hope of ever returning, its Rangers set down their ten-gallon hats for good. Randy Shackleford was again given hope when he was told that Texas Company would return under the banner of the Rogue Rangers."
  DES_henry_dundy_theorist_desc:0 "§P"Never shy away from a good fight!"§!\n\nHenry Dundy is the kind of person you know, no matter what happens, they will make it. For years he’d served at inconsequential outposts and stations. That changed when he was sent to Phoenix, Arizona, to reinforce the Ranger garrison. Upon arrival, the city was under siege. Mortar fire slammed against the ancient buildings, sending them tumbling down the busy streets below.\n\nWhile the Rangers tried to aid the citizens to escape, the Legion made their first move into the city. The shelling continued, and the Legion had begun setting up sandbags and carts in intersections and alleys. Assessing the situation, the Rangers knew it was hopeless, but they set up in fallen buildings waiting for another advance.\n\nOnce the Legion started their second march, the Rangers opened fire. The Legion battalions’ organization had completely fallen apart in the shock, and they were sent back, running every which way through the city streets. A new team tried to rush the Ranger’s position but failed again. This pattern continued several times until half of the Legion’s invasion force began to pour over the position. The Rangers were forced into retreat, half dying in the race back. Phoenix then became just another piece of the growing empire of the Legion, and what remained of the Arizona Rangers became the Cowboy Country. Henry Dundy then retired from the Rangers, only returning when asked to join the Rogue Rangers."
  DES_dexter_cunningham_theorist_desc:0 "§5"A good leader can make any idiot with a gun a proficient idiot with a gun."§!\n\nNever much of a fighter, but a mind made for war, Dexter Cunningham shows all the qualities a Ranger strives for, most prominently cunning. Having been an early graduate of the Ranger Academy, Dexter Cunningham was tasked by §tHell Razor§! himself to clear out an underground slaving operation being conducted in Klamath. Upon arriving with a team of four others, they searched and found the base of operations to be the old Ra’at cave.\n\nOnce cleared out by the Chosen One, it’d become a hub for one of the worst slaving operations California had seen. Throughout the next coming weeks, a plan was made; they soon posted a sniper, laid a few traps, and went to work. The waning hours of the night were filled with the ringing of gunfire and the shrieking howls of slavers. The Rangers were victorious, the pens were emptied, and the enslaved people were brought back to their families .\n\nThe plan had been created by Cunningham himself, and because of that, he was awarded the most for his work. Once the Rangers had divided, he’d be personally asked by the Rogue Ranger herself to join them, which he accepted most graciously."
  DES_the_way_of_the_ranger_theorist_desc:0 "§YAnd we'll keep on fighting\nFor there's wrongs to be righting\nAnd our victories grow year by year\nCause despite all the dangers\nThe old Desert Rangers\nWell the world knows that we persevere\n\nYes, the Rangers abide!\nWe fight side by side!\nThrough darkness and chaos and fear\nFrom the dawn of Year Zero\nThe world's needed heroes\nSo the Rangers must still persevere.§!\n\nFrom the Texas Rangers, to the Arizona Rangers, to the Desert Rangers, to the NCR Rangers, to the Nevada Rangers a Ranger does what's right. The cause inspires the Rangers, and they always use what's available to them to get the job done.\n\nBut it's important to know something else, that no Ranger who dies in the line of duty will ever be forgotten, nor will they have ever died in vain... or unavenged."
  DES_john_ashbourne_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§G"Er-go-nom-ics. Do you get what that means? Means it feels good in your hands!"§!\n\nThe 12 gauge autoloader. The .45-long slide, with laser sighting. Phased plasma rifle in the 40-watt range. If you can think of it, John Ashbourne has taken a man's life with it. Ashbourne is, in every sense of the word, a gun nut. He can take apart an assault carbine with his eyes closed, install a caliber conversion sleeve with one hand, and put together a service rifle's bolt assembly with just his mouth.\n\nStories differ on where he picked up this obsession, even his; maybe it was that his late father's parting gift was a nine millimeter handgun, maybe it was when he realized the raw power at his fingertips after he fired a minigun for the first time. Unfounded rumors claim he paid a prostitute with a bullet, and the experience crossed his wires the wrong way.\n\nWhatever it is, it's turned man into a living weapons encyclopedia, a skill which brings with it lots of insight into how weapons ought to be made and how arms factories ought to be built."
  DES_herschel_smith_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§6"How about we settle this over a drink?"§!\n\nHerschel Smith is a man you could call loose in every regard; he's loose with the rules, his lips, his organization, and especially his drink.\n\nBefore his time in the Rangers, Herschel spent his days as —in kind terms— a charismatic local with a penchant for drink. It just so happens that being the local drunkard meant Hershel knew a bit about everybody and had built up little ill will amongst the rangers beyond a few unwelcome offers to a 'late night rendezvous'. So, when the search for a diplomatic 'lets-all-get-along' type concluded, there were no better candidates than boozy ol' Herschel Smith.\n\nHis office is constantly draped in a thin coat of disorder with both his desk and the floor covered in papers, his furniture always situated at strange and uncomfortable angles, and his terminal filled to the brim with little files full of nonsense typed while intoxicated.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the only well-kept thing in his life is his liquor cabinet."
  DES_thrasher_sagarra_army_chief_desc:0 "§2"Good tactics can save even the worst strategy. Bad tactics will destroy even the best strategy."§!\n\nWith his new post as Chief of Army, Thrasher is ready to start detailing battle plans for the battles to come. It may take him a while to think one up, but once he is finished, no expense is spared, and no possibility is left out. As for the Rangers' enemies, they will soon find out what it means to pick a fight with the Desert Rangers."
  DES_thrasher_sagarra_high_command_desc:0 "§2"Today's tactical victory does not guarantee tomorrow's strategic success."§!\n\nA bona fide giant among Rangers, the 6'6 (2 cm shy of two meters) Thrasher has been Snake Vargas' strongest and most loyal teammate by far. He preferred melee combat, the kind of man who brought fists to a knife fight and knives to a gunfight. He was part of the Ranger Team Alpha that invaded Base Cochise and paid dearly for it; He was severely wounded and eventually lost his leg despite treatment. Still, he considers it a bargain. Otherwise, he would've been dead before thirty.\n\nWhile not fit for combat directly, he likes to sit on the radio sometimes to advise field commanders. Often he'll recommend overperformers to be elevated in the chain of command.\n\nWhen Thrasher originally heard that Abigail Lee was headed out into Nevada with a band of Rangers and that Snake Vargas was not far behind, he followed suit, waiting to see what would come of it."
  DES_thrasher_sagarra_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§2"Everything outside our little triangle has become terra incognita. Our influence is shrinking when it should be expanding."§!\n\nThrasher, at his old age, has been around since the roots of the Rangers were first placed down in Nevada, he has been around long enough to witness the good they can do for the wasteland, and he has been around to know what things were like back in Arizona. Thrasher spends many of his days writing up detailed maps and reading over old books on strategies. He tries his best to pass off some of his accrued knowledge to other members of the High Command in the Rangers' military.\n\nAlthough he might be old and fat, he is still a powerful man. You can tell by looking at him that he could still easily remove his prosthetic leg and beat any young recruit."
  DES_hell_razor_army_chief_desc:0 "§t"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly."§!\n\nWith Hell Razor at the head of operations he will stop at nothing to crush the remaining Raiders within his sphere of influence. No punch will be pulled and no expense made. It's time to take back Nevada, Utah, and Arizona for the People. It's time to put all the Evil of this world to rest. A new age for the Rangers is at hand with Hell Razor at the helm."
  DES_hell_razor_high_command_desc:0 "§t"No matter where evil may hide, Justice will find it in the end."§!\n\nBorn in 2060 on October 20th, Hell Razor was a member of the ranger team along with §YSnake Vargas§!, §LAngela Deth§!, and §2Thrasher§! that invaded and destroyed Base Cochise. He was notable for his berserker combat style and desert survival skills, complementing the team's skillset. His brash manner and lack of self-control didn't endear Vargas to him at first, but ultimately, it worked out for all of them.\n\nIt helped that Razor was a Ranger to the bone, a soldier who could never live anywhere else but on the battlefield. After Cochise fell, Razor just took his rifle and a pack of smokes then and went out on another patrol. After Angela Deth was promoted to lead Team Alpha, Razor stayed with her for a while before becoming a lone wolf and one of Vargas' most dependable operatives. Though he could go dark for weeks, he always returned with results.\n\nWhen the Rangers were pushed out of Arizona, he didn't hang up his iron, he knew that there were people who needed brough to justice everywhere. So when Abigail Lee and Vargas marched into Nevada he wasn't far behind them."
  DES_hell_razor_theorist_desc:0 "§t"You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you."§!\n\nBrigand Team got its name under Hell Razor's leadership because of their brutal tactics. Laying in wait for an ambush, poisoning the chem supply that raiders rely on, and even sending back captured prisoners strapped with explosives. If a trick is dirty, you can expect it in their tactics book.\n\nIn Hell Razor's mind, the best way to beat out the evil in this world is by using their techniques against them. That's true Justice, in his opinion, is whatever gets the job done most efficiently."
  DES_angela_deth_army_chief_desc:0 "§L"An old military facility from before the war, and one of the biggest fights the Rangers ever had. There was some crazy computer in there that kept spittin' out robots and sendin' em off to kill people. We had one hell of a fight puttin' it down. Earned our stripes that day - literally. That's when I became Captain Deth."§!\n\nDeath, or victory. One can never be sure what Angela is seeking when in the field. But there is also a softer side to Angela, the one that cares deeply about her comrades and the friends she made all those years ago.\n\n"§YSnake§! was one wild ass son of a bitch back in the day, but I think the weight of his responsibilities squashed that out of him now. He hasn't been in a decent bar fight in... shit, a decade, maybe?"\n\n"§tHell Razor§! didn't talk much. Didn't make friends easy. Wasn't big on the social graces. But he was as loyal as they come, and when the shit started flyin', he was the guy you wanted at your back. He didn't win that name by accident. Sharp as a razor, scary as hell."\n\n"Funny, back in the day §2Gilbert§! seemed like this big ol' growly bear. Strong as an ox and just about as articulate too. But then he got all torn up during our fight with the robots from Base Cochise, and he couldn't go on patrol anymore. And wouldn't ya know it? Turns out the ol' bear has a knack for cartography. Who'da thunk it?"\n\n"§1Ace§! and me... well, we'd been fightin' side by side for nigh on twenty years. I didn't let him die unavenged.""
  DES_angela_deth_high_command_desc:0 "§L"I'm Angie. You, kids, must the new recruits ol' Vargas trained up. Lord, y'all just babies. You remind me of us - Snake, Razor, Thrasher, and me - back when we were starting out. Thinkin' we were gonna save the world for the future. Thinkin' none of us would ever die. I..."§!\n\nThe stereotype of the rebellious redhead is alive and well in Angela Deth, probably the most famous living Desert Ranger-if she is still alive. Raised in a small, highly religious community, Angela had a falling out with the town elders when she decided that if there was a God, the inherent suffering of the Wasteland meant that God was evil. She left and never looked back.\n\nAs a member of Ranger Team Alpha, Angela fought her way to glory in the first Cochise conflict. In the years after, she assumed command of Team Alpha from Snake Vargas, and her name became synonymous with the Desert Rangers. Eventually, she was forced to leave Arizona behind along with a lot of the Rangers, being forced out by the Legion\n\nWhen the Ranger Unification Treaty was signed, Angela joined up with the NCR Rangers thinking that she had some debt to repay for being given a second chance. And when §YSnake§! said he was leaving to settle a score with an upstart bunch of rowdy Rangers in Nevada, she bit her tongue, knowing that she might lose yet another one who was so close to her. Eventually she received the news that Snake Vargas won out in a chance duel, becoming Ranger General of that rowdy group and renegotiating the terms of the Unification Treaty. Now Angela has the chance to be part of the team that made history all those years ago once again."
  DES_angela_deth_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§L"Godammit, Ace. Y'never shoulda put down the wrench and picked up the gun..."§!\n\nAngela is not a woman known for fear, apprehension, and sadness about death; unless, of course, you ask her about Ace.\n\nAce is the name of Angela's late partner, a skilled mechanic, demolitions man, and lover. (One would have to be to tame such a wild spirit as the Angel of Death.) He was killed on his last mission before retirement, a supposedly routine job to attach repeater units to major antennas in Arizona. He went alone, and he never came back.\n\nAngela carries on his memory in many ways, not the least of which is some of that mechanical expertise she picked up from him while he was alive. Among the skull tattoos that cover Angela's arms, there is a single heart, and within that heart, a single name, §1"Ace"§!."
  DES_elias_wordsworth_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§3"A good deal can move even the Sierra Nevada."§!\n\nElias isn't so much loyal to the Rangers as he is dedicated to their potential. There isn't enough room in Redding or Shady Sands for an up-and-coming baron like himself. So after a meeting with Abigail and 40 years of advanced pay, he went to work fulfilling the Ranger's material demands for war and pocketing a hefty profit.\n\nElias may be the most well-connected man in Nevada. While many do what he does, only he can cross an NCR or Vault City checkpoint without being shot for treason or arrested for smuggling.\n\nOne day, the Great Basin will be settled either by the NCR or some other power yet to be seen, but until then, Elias will continue to nickel and dime every pound of scrap."
  DES_randy_aldgate_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§L"We're not looking for cowboys out here; we're looking for men with the courage to stand up against the odds and the skills to back it up. If you're the type to run from a fight, you're not the type we're looking for."§!\n\nRandy Aldgate began life glowing, sick with radiation poisoning. The story of his onset struggle for life would become his favorite tale to spin, with each iteration a little bolder than the last. Having been born into the Rangers, he’d been surrounded by the bravest and most fearsome warriors the wasteland had to offer and often the most braggadocious. The stories of raids against slavers, battling death claws, and scouting out Enclave patrols exercised young Aldgate’s mind. He took up writing and soon had his book printed at the NCR’s presses. The 114 Page §Y"New Adventures in the Old West"§! did wonders for the popularity of the Rangers.\n\nNew recruits began flooding in, asking when they get to kill their first Deathclaw or stomp out some secret enclave bunker. Randy Aldgate became the head of public relations for the Rangers and the most outspoken critic of NCR-Ranger unification. In his eyes, the NCR was too soft and would only limit the Ranger's ability to fight the wasteland’s evils.\n\nNone of which mattered in the end, and with the formation of the Rogue Rangers, Aldgate left with them. Having lost most of their previous workforce, Aldgate would step up as the recruiter for what’s left of the Rangers."
  DES_doctor_verdrehtnerv_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§0"The dead don’t learn from their mistakes... but I do."§!\n\nBorn in Shady Sands and raised on a Brahmin ranch, Doctor Verdrehtnerv was as Californian as they come. However, deep inside, there sat a longing for something more. The Shady Sands medical center was too clean and professional, and worst of all, it was a bore. This growing hatred accumulated in a severe medical malpractice case and a bounty for the doctor’s head.\n\nWhilst living on the outskirts of New Vegas, Verdrehtnerv founded a business providing aid to the fringe of society. Once the NCR began to move into Vegas, it was time again to pack up and leave. Wandering through the desert for days, he eventually encountered the Rogue Rangers. After boasting his skills, he was given a tent and put to work.\n\nIf any place was to be safe from the ire of the NCR, it’d be a society built on opposing it."
  DES_patrick_fitzpatrick_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§t"In the wasteland, there is no such thing as a fair fight. It is a fight to the finish, and only the fittest will prevail."§!\n\nRaised in the remnant of Bunkerville, Nevada, Patrick Fitzpatrick was the fourth son of a family of gecko trappers. Being the smallest of his family, his role was to oversee the maintenance and upkeep of the various tools and weapons needed for the hunt. Day through the dusk, spears were fitted, and cages tooled. Through their sale, these craftings made a name for the Fitzpatricks, but Nevada is no place to become recognized. On one usual hunt, a gang of raiders appeared and decimated the family save for Patrick, who remained oblivious at home. Eventually, the Rangers showed up and took Patrick into their ranks.\n\nDeemed unfit for service, he proved more useful back at the base than on the battlefield. Initially set for rifle cleaning, the job was completed within a week. Soon enough, every firearm within the Ranger's arsenal wound up spotless. Leaving every other quartermaster with an empty workload, he’d subsequently be promoted to the head of the whole department.\n\nAs long as something needs to be done for the Rangers, no matter what they call themselves, he’ll be there."
  DES_mr_manners_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§6"Manners Maketh Man."§!\n\nThere was a time when men were taught proper manners. Don't kill your neighbors, don't steal from children, floss regularly. Sadly it seems those days are long over, but some still pine for somebody to teach them how to be proper; Mr. Manners is that man. Raised in a Shady Sands suburb, Manners idolized the image of the prim and proper.\n\nWhat started as a personal quest for Manners became a marketable skill. As it turns out, politicians, he'd out raiders, and rogue sentient robots alike all wished to be sophisticated, or at least appear to be.\n\nA new age of wasteland chivalry was beginning to emerge, and Mr. Manners was going to ensure it was centered on his visions of nobility."
  DES_mark_anderson_high_command_desc:0 "§7"There are two types of people in this world; those who can see the value in a well-executed plan, and those who are nothing more than pawns in a game they will never understand."§!\n\nAn imposing figure who’s always one step ahead. He’d arrived at the citadel one day clutching a fistful of bounty papers and a bag of wanted heads, which he traded for a position in Ranger high command. Typically reserved and mild-mannered, he’s prone to bouts of rage regarding the unpredictable. A cunning tactician, his skills regarding prediction and effective reaction made him a valuable asset.\n\nFor some, enough was enough. All his wrath brought was more destruction, an apparent disrespect to the core values of the Rangers. A plan had been raised by a collective within the Rangers to depose and kill Anderson in his sleep. The plot ended with the disappearance of every conspirator the night before the attack. The rest of the high command decided to keep him, choosing him as their friend rather than foe. Soon enough, however, with the separation of the Rangers, he would become their enemy nonetheless.\n\nMark Anderson left the Rangers with his loyal supporters, where they formed the short-lived Anderson Warband before being absorbed into the Rogue Rangers later."
  DES_koal_morales_high_command_desc:0 "§R"Let’s level the playing field!"§!\n\nKoal Morales is a skilled tactician devoted to destruction. He’d already lost both legs to a landmine within a month of serving the Rangers. He returned to the citadel, studying what had taken his ability to walk away. Once he was field-ready again §G(fit with a shiny new pair of prosthetic legs)§! he led a campaign of establishing minefields, trapping buildings, and making Molotov cocktails, all to be used within raider territory. This scheme ran for years, proving its worthwhileness every day.\n\nWhen the NCR pressed its influence on the Rangers, the organization’s fracture had Koal Morales deciding the NCR-Rangers was a better fit. Fundamentally, they were more potent and practiced more traditional Ranger values. The fracturing of organizations coincided with the promotion of Morales to a member of the army's high command. Yet, it seemed the NCR hadn’t known the main facet of his strategy when they deemed using firebombs and unmarked minefields a war crime.\n\nWhat had been the backbone of his system had been barred from him to use. To Morales’s eyes, this was just the first sign of the NCR overstepping its boundary. The next night, he packed his things and made way for the 'real' Rangers."
  DES_veteran_ranger_trippy_army_chief_desc:0 "§g"Wake me when the sun sets, and I’ll handle those problems of yours."§!\n\nRanger Trippy was always considered a little off by many of his comrades, with a habit of slipping out at night and sleeping most of the day, but they paid it little mind as long as he did his duty. And do his duty he did. He was the best night operator around and often given special missions that reflected that expertise.\n\nIt was when a fateful accident exposed a small pharmacy's worth of Cateye bottles in his footlocker that suddenly his star fell. It wasn’t enough to have him drummed out of the Rangers, but afterward, many others avoided him or treated him like a junkie. Feeling alienated, Abigail’s crew won over Trippy at her insistence that he’d be treated like the valuable asset he was.\n\nSecretly, he’d have preferred to stay and work with the NCR, but such is the way of things sometimes."
  DES_tycho_jr_jr_army_chief_desc:0 "§O"Leave your worries in your pack, boys and girls; you’ve got not one but two Tycho’s at your back. That counts for a hell of a lot!"§!\n\nThe grandson of the famous Tycho who walked California with the Vault Dweller and the son of Tycho Jr, a respected Ranger in his own right, Tycho ‘Junior’ Jr came along with his father to lend their aid to the Rogue Ranger.\n\nA charismatic and affable young man, ‘Junior’ is popular with the rest of the band and Abigail touts the support of the Tycho’s as a sign of her moral superiority. In truth, ‘Junior’ is cynical at heart, remembering the stories of the Legion coming to destroy the Ranger Citadel and not wishing to be anywhere near their warpath.\n\nIf that means following his distant and doubting father off into the wilds of Arizona to tag along with a rebel company then he’ll take it."
  DES_veteran_ranger_holstadt_high_command_desc:0 "§Y"When you can cross the desert on a single canteen, kill four raiders in six shots and come home in one piece, you can call yourself a Ranger."§!\n\nErnst Holstadt has been an active Ranger and teaching new ones the tricks of the trade for most of his life, a long enough span that he can remember when half the upstarts around him were toddling about with snot dripping from their noses.\n\nDozens of Rangers learned their way around the desert under his watch and went on to keep the people of Nevada safe. It’s a legacy he’s damn proud of, and the idea of his beloved Rangers becoming soldiers for cap-grubbing desk jockeys squatting in the ass end of California was more than he could take. Holstadt was among the first to pledge his revolver to her cause when Abigail left to become the Rogue Ranger.\n\nUnder her banner Holstadt does much as he did before, taking prospective Rangers out into the wastes to learn how to survive and thrive firsthand."
  DES_frederica_mercury_air_chief_desc:0 "§4"Did it hurt when I fell from heaven? No, I had a parachute."§!\n\nFrederica once was a raider, one of the Sky Reavers that haunt the empty deserts between the NCR and Utah. Abigail Lee captured her in one of her last missions before the fateful treaty that would drive her to rebel.\n\nOn her way out the door, the future Rogue Ranger offered to set the one-time Reaver free if she wanted to get out of this shithole. With few other options, Frederica took the ranger up on her offer and decided to follow her north.\n\nNow Frederica is one of the younger Rangers in Abigail’s crew, having been given a crash course on being one by the Rogue Ranger herself. Frederica’s experience with the Reavers gives her insight into those devices that soar the sky that her comrades do not, and it could prove invaluable."
  DES_veteran_ranger_rigby_navy_chief_desc:0 "§B"Dammit, we need to find our way to the coast someday. Can you imagine setting a whole army out to sea? Must be quite a sight."§!\n\nCraig Rigby grew up on the banks of Lake Tahoe, building rafts and boats to ride the water as best he could when the Mirelurks weren’t trying to eat him anyway. When he was grown, and many of his friends headed to Reno with dreams of becoming gangsters, Rigby instead headed south with dreams of becoming one of the fabled Desert Rangers.\n\nWhile many of his old friends likely ended up dead or junkies, Rigby’s plans came true, and he wears the title of Veteran Ranger with pride. He didn’t dream of becoming a private policeman for the New California Republic. When Abigail packed up and left, Rigby came along as well.\n\nHe still remembers his old days of taking to the water and has much to share whenever the rangers find a river or lake to bypass."
  DES_tycho_senior_jr_theorist_desc:0 "§O"A Ranger’s training isn't simply teaching them how to survive... it's about giving them the skills required to improve things for innocent folks... Well, it used to be, at least."§!\n\nTycho Sr. Jr. has been a Ranger since birth, following his father’s footsteps, the legendary Tycho of Nevada. Much to the objection of his mother, he accepted this, becoming almost famous amongst recruits as a genius tactician and inspiring leader. But, on her death bed, his mother shared a secret she had kept to allow the good Tycho Jr. brought to be still done; Tycho wanted to escape the Ranger life and give his son a safe life away from the dangers of the wasteland. This revelation destroyed Senior, who had recently become a father himself.\n\nWhen the Legion came, many looked to him for guidance, and when they knocked on Ranger Center’s door, he ran, kid son in arms, tail between his legs. But still, with his renown, he motioned many Rangers into joining the NCR, being a chief supporter of the unification.\n\nWithin the Rogue Rangers, he has become little more than a drill instructor, begrudgingly accepted by Abby, he believes the rangers still his duty, as well as the guidance of his son, Tycho Jr. the third, Tycho himself being nicknamed “Senior” in jest. Coward or not, he will fight for his family till death, and family means Rangers...\n\n§YAfter all, there's still some good to be done before he dies.§!"
