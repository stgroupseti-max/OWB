  nf_lum.1.d:0 ""The Great Glowing One, Blessed Be His Will, No One Need Question His Holiness" - Prayer For The Misled, Book of the Glow, 5:19\n\nThe figure of the Luminous Ones, the necromancer known as The Great Glowing One, does not talk or discuss his life before the Glow. Nor do any of his followers. Some of his closest advisors do not believe he himself even remembers. However, he talks of things only those born or having lived before the Great War could know. The decadence of America, the greenery of the land, the civility and mundane nature of life in a nation that was only years away from recovering or collapsing in on itself. \n\nHowever, the Great Glowing One was not always so great. Unbeknownst to all his followers, aside from his closest and most trusted devotees, the Great Glowing One remembers being sickly and ill. He remembers machines made for monitoring health beeping wildly, cries of sorrow, and looks of solemn regret. A long droning wail, followed by a series of sudden beeps. He does not know why he was sickly, but those memories of mortality give him all the reason he needs to never submit to weakness ever again, made reality through his becoming of a Glowing One.\n\nIn truth, the Great Glowing One's time before the Great War was marked by..."
  nf_lum.1.a:0 "...a struggle with a vicious disease, possibly cancerous."
  nf_lum.1.b:0 "...the near-fatal experience in not having eaten for days."
  nf_lum.1.c:0 "...wounds suffered from an undetermined conflict, perhaps even self-inflicted."

  nf_lum.2.t:0 "Staring In"
  nf_lum.2.d:0 "The Great Glowing One, after the Great War, spent much time wandering the new wasteland that America had become. He saw ordinary animals become mutated beasts. He saw those like himself go mad with rage, sadness, or worse, never to recover. He was shot at by early survivors, who did not understand or care for the green glow of their visitors, lest they potentially contract it themselves. At times, the Great Glowing One once again suffered between the knowledge of if he even needed to consume food or drink.\n\nAll of these and more factored into the eventual descent into madness of the Great Glowing One. Visions of things that weren't there, grotesque distortions of otherwise normal or unassuming sights, even cries and calls from an androgynous voice, begging him to 'come back'. He was on the brink of becoming like those he had seen, feral, beastly, and mindless. It was only with the arrival of a lucid and slowly deranging Great Glowing One to a radioactive wasteland just outside the Cordon Sanitaire of Nebraska. \n\n"Ho! On Yonder! A Brilliant Vision Engulfed The Mind And Cleared The Eyes Of The Great Glowing One! He Set About To Bring This Vision True!" - Chant of Clarity, Book of the Glow, 3:13"
  nf_lum.2.a:0 "He saw the Earth, and all people on it holding hands in unity."
  nf_lum.2.b:0 "He saw the mass of military, tens of thousands of ghouls, armed to the teeth, ready for war."
  nf_lum.2.c:0 "He saw a bright light seemingly fracturing reality, promising the secrets of the universe."

  nf_lum.3.t:0 "Shepherding The Lambs"
  nf_lum.3.d:0 "From the ashes of despair and the depths of madness, the Great Glowing One emerged with a newfound purpose, as radiant and unyielding as the Glow itself: He would be the shepherd of humanity's radiant future. His travels took him far and wide, seeking wisdom and truth wherever it could be found. One pivotal stop was Gravestone, where the Bishops of Plutonius taught him the sacred rites of atomic reverence. There, he learned to wield radiation as both salvation and weapon, to split ignorance like an atom under pressure, releasing the cleansing light of conversion. When he left Gravestone, it was with their fiery blessing: 'In the Glow, all are reforged!'\n\nReturning to the Cradle, the Great Glowing One began his mission in earnest. His silver-green tongue worked tirelessly, preaching to humans and ghouls alike, proclaiming the inevitability of ghoulification as humanity's next holy step. One of his first converts was the Glowing Father, once a Pre-War Buddhist refugee and living embodiment of the tantric mysteries, who had wandered the wastes for decades in search of peace. The Glowing Father’s tranquil demeanor and deep understanding of suffering brought a spiritual weight to the Great Glowing One’s burgeoning movement, and together, they traveled the wilds, bringing followers back to the Cradle.\n\nWhile the Glowing Father prided himself on converting through compassion and reason, the Great Glowing One, haunted by memories of his encounters with violent and hostile wastelanders, took a different approach. He began constructing a private sanctum where he could experiment on faith, humanity, and the Glow itself. There, he performed rituals of conversion on the unwilling, their screams echoing through the Cradle as flesh and faith were reforged into something new.\n\n"Witness, my disciples! The unworthy shall be stripped of their weakness, their fragile humanity split apart like an unstable isotope. And from this radiance, a devout ghoul shall emerge, baptized by the light of the Glow!" - The Great Glowing One, Book of Eternity, REDACTED"
  nf_lum.3.a:0 "The Great Glowing One used his silver-green tongue to bring converts to the Cradle."
  nf_lum.3.b:0 "Whether converts could only be found by land, sea, or air, the Great Glowing One would find them."
  nf_lum.3.c:0 "The Glowing Father grew concerned at the amount of time the Great One spent in his lab..."

  nf_lum.4.t:0 "The Father and the Great One"
  nf_lum.4.d:0 "The Glow's Cradle, having grown and grown over the years, slowly went from a radioactive wasteland into a near military-industrial complex. Crucifixions were set up upon the mouth of the most radioactive pits, for conversion of the most devout humans. Armories, barracks, and armored churches sprouted up across what little land could be settled on. Sermons of peace and prosperity were slowly replaced with angry shouts of 'conversion for the unworthy' and 'gifts for the ungifted'. \n\nThe Glowing Father, having gone on longer and longer individual missions, slowly realized the militant conversion of the faith he had once been a harbinger of, and sought to make things right. Taking the Great Glowing One aside after a sermon, the Glowing Father referred him to a location across the river that could be the next step in expanding the faith, with Pre-War water treatment facilities and abandoned uranium mines that could make for a new conversion center.\n\nIn reality, the Glowing Father had only visited the location once, deeming it worthless and unable to be properly restored by anyone, even his own followers. It was with this knowledge that he sent the Great Glowing One and the majority of his militant mass on their way. After they had crossed the river, he and his peaceful acolytes built outposts and barricades across the river, ensuring it could not be crossed, and locking the newly Luminous Ones to their side of the river.\n\nThe Great Glowing One had only realized the trickery after several weeks of lost contact. He set his followers out to claim the heavily irradiated ruins of Cheyenne while establishing himself at the Red Mountain, in preparation for conflict with those who had taken to a very hostile reapproach to his faith. The Baggers, due to their belief that no one should be forcefully converted to any religion, let alone forcefully Ghoulified, and the Withered Dogs for their experiences with religious charlatans in the past."

  nf_lum.5.t:0 "A Special Sermon"
  nf_lum.5.d:0 "The Great Glowing One looked over at the former leaders of the Baggers, Goddard and Coleridge. The two of them had been stripped of their garments, save for the religious robes donned on them by the Great One's acolytes. They were hung in large iron cages, high over a radioactive waste pit.\n\n"It Is With This Great Victory, Feeble Humans, That I Cast Thee Into Eternity. May It Have Mercy On Your Souls."\n\nWith that, the cages slowly descended. Coleridge was the first to suffer exposure, beginning to vomit on his robes, his brown hair fluttering off as though it were a wig. His skin slowly sagged until it came falling off, making the man resemble a melting art piece than a human. Goddard suffered worse. He screamed even before the cages began lowering, rattling the bars for help that would not come. The screams only died down, as Goddard's screams became more primal and feral. By the time the cages had reached their lowest point, both had become agonizing monuments to those who wronged the Luminous Ones. They could not even be determined as still being sane or feral, their ear-piercing screams continuing to dominate the ongoing chants and praises of the gathered crowd.\n\nThe Withered Dogs, as they were already Ghoulified, did not have to suffer the fate of the Baggers. They had simply been affixed with large metal crossed nailed to their bodies and outright tossed into the radioactive waste pit. Although it was a waste of good men to the Great Glowing One, it was necessary to ensure his men had no other leaders to follow besides him."

  nf_lum.6.t:0 "The Glowing Coronation"
  nf_lum.6.d:0 "The Great Glowing One sat, adorned in his special Luminous Power Armour, on his former Cradle Throne. The throne had been one of the only objects brought from the Glow's Cradle, being the main source of the immense amount of charging power needed to recharge the Great Glowing One's suit. Restored to functionality now that the conflict was over and resources could be spared, he once again wore the armor he had personally crafted decades ago to empower himself in a dangerous Wasteland. His royal advisers stood closest to him, with his Luminous Warriors close by, to ensure the full compliance of the gathered crowd in front of and behind the Great Glowing One.\n\nAlthough the Glow's Cradle had yet to be recovered, the victory over the Baggers and Withered Dogs was significant enough for the Great Glowing One to decide to undergo his coronation as the King of Luminescence. The Chained Adviser brought out the crown, the modified and reforged Luminous Power Armor helmet that had been recovered so long ago, in the early days of the Great Glowing One. \n\n"I Humbly Accept My Crowning As The King Of The Kingdom Of Luminescence! NOW BOW TO ME!"\n\nThe Undying Knights readied their weapons, activating the radioactive green glow of them, as the crowd began to cheer and celebrate, with the few who were remotely non-compliant quickly joining in on the celebration.\n\n"I AM YOUR KING, I AM LIFE AND UNDEATH ITSELF. I AM THE GREATEST OF THE GLOWING ONES!" WE. ARE. ETERNAL!"
  nf_lum.6.a:0 "With that, the crown was set on head of the King of Luminescence."

  nf_lum.7.t:0 "The Passion Of The Great Glowing One"
  nf_lum.7.d:0 "Dead Man's Junction, after having several years of true peace and prosperity under the Glowing Father, now was once again the site of militaristic chants, angry sermons, and now, bloodied and wounded ghouls, mostly of captured, converted, or outright killed heretics of the Glowing Father. The Glowing Father himself was collapsed under the Luminous Power Armored foot of the Great Glowing One.\n\nThe Great Glowing One continued looking straight ahead, putting pressure on the head of the Father. "You Tricked Me. You Betrayed Me. You Almost Humiliated Me." The pressure increased.\n\n"But You Have Done One Favor To Me. Before, I Was A Fool To Trust Others To Do The Work Of The Faithful. You? You Only Made Me Mean." The Great Glowing one removed the foot from The Glowing Father's head.\n\n"Warriors, Pick Up This Wretch Of A Follower. Let Me Show Him The Meaning Of Eternity."\n\nWith that, the Glowing Father was disrobed, his rotted and near-naked body on display to the whole of the Glow's Cradle. After some preparation, a tall, metal, electric crucifix was set up, ominously looming higher and farther than any crucifix next to it.\n\nThe Great Glowing One beckoned to his Warriors, who began the process of nailing the former Father to the cross. He turned to the gathered crowd.\n\n"WE ARE VICTORIOUS OVER THE HERETICS!"\n\nThe crowd cheered.\n\n"FOR OUR VICTORY, REJOICE AND MAKE MERRY! WE SHALL CELEBRATE THIS DAY FOR DAYS TO COME!""
  nf_lum.7.a:0 "As the crowd left, only the Glowing Father hung on the electric crucifix, never to die, but never to truly live again."

  nf_lum.8.t:0 "Needs of a King"
  nf_lum.8.d:0 "The Great Glowing One and his Advisors, The Chained and The Adorned, were gathered around the metal table within the Great Glowing One's old sanctum. The Advisers had spent several days drafting potential sites for the new capital of the Great Glowing Castle, a monumental cathedral to the majesty of the Great Glowing One.\n\nThe Adorned spoke first, gripping his radioactive pendant. "Your Kingliness, The Chained and myself have come up with several sites, but we have narrowed it down to two or three sites throughout your Kingdom."\n\nThe Chained spoke up, pointing to the first site. "Your Kingliness may find it prudent to build it here in Dead Man's Junction. Not only is it the true site of worthiness and the Faith, but it has also been sufficiently reinforced over the years, though we are still rebuilding after the defilement of the False Father."\n\nThe Adorned spoke next. "His Greatness could also consider returning to Red Mountain to build it. Not only have we still set up a great community there, but it also allows for us to promptly prepare for the Great Glowing Crusade against the unfaithful of Colorado."\n\nThe Chained spoke up once more. "It may be worth considering building the castle next to the Boulder Dome in Colorado. The Dome is said to hold many secrets you could divine the meaning of. And a grand Tower next to such a renowned bastion does wonders on convincing locals of our faith and power, your Majesty."\n\nThe two advisors spoke in tandem in their final selection. "We only have so many resources, so choose wisely, Your Holiness!"\n\nThe Great Glowing One narrowed his eyes at the map. Finally, he came to a decision, and pointed commandingly to a spot on the map."

  nf_lum.9.d:0 "From The Private Book Of The Great Glowing One (Editorialized for reading): "In my several dozen years studying the ghoul anatomy, I have come to discover more and more evidence to support my theorem on the proper means of conversion of a human to that of the radiological ghoul."\n\nThe Great Glowing One looked up from his book, thinking back to some of the experiments he had conducted earlier in the week, having grown rusty from his time at Red Mountain.\n\n"Experiment #1602: Subject required resuscitation from exposure to 30,000 Rads. Much better result than exposure to 300,000 Rads."\n\nSubject 1602 looked mindlessly at the Great Glowing One from its cage, its jawless, eyeless head only giving faint gutteral exhales to indicate its condition.\n\n"Experiment #1795: Subject was introduced to 3,000 Rads. Experienced severe agony before bone liquidation. Reminder to have Advisers clean up mess."\n\n"Experiment #1942: Subject held in amicable conditions before undergoing treatment. Given portions of food and water, as well as personal luxuries, as they were slowly sedated. Subject was experimented on, and remarkably came out as a necrotic post-human without any forseeable side effects, will continue to monitor."\n\nThe Great Glowing One stood up from his desk, approaching the lab cage. A small chalkboard, that had seen plenty of use over the decades, read Experiment #1942."How Are You Feeling Today?"\n\nA figure walked out from the darkly lit corner of the room. Although its skin was rotten and flies were beginning to encircle it, the figure gave a rotted smile and thumbs up. "Can't say I've never felt better, but I've felt worse!""

But You Require Smoothskins Kept From The Glow And Delivered For Your Experiments."\n\nOne of the scientists nodded. "Yes, and if you are willing to fund us... well, we can discuss the exact amount later, but we will ensure we get the success percentage up. The Legion never sold us more than a small fraction of their slaves, so we've only made headway on doubling the success rate since the second wave began.

While the 'Purifying Metal' was typically reserved only for his experiments and most proven warriors, the surplus of Pre-War uranium caused him to reconsider at least some of his approach to the usage of the metal.\n\nHowever, with so much uranium to spare, he only had enough to make one of his ideas for the metal into reality.

The 'Rotten General', as he had come to be identified by both those who despised and those who praised him, raised his warhammer's handle, silently slamming the head into the ground. It was time. A single shot was fired into the air, signaling to the remaining force on the west side of the fort that it was time to attack.\n\nThe brown cowls of Gherze and his group masked their entry into the Fort. Without effort, whilst most of the Fort's men were focused on the major direct attack on the west side, Gherze's group took out the remaining soldiers who wanted to investigate the shot that had come from the east side. Skulls were smashed, blades cut through fresh and rotten flesh alike, silenced bullets ended the lives of the soldiers. And yet all of it was done without a sound, even despite the rapturous roar that continued to emerge from the west side of the fort.\n\nAs Gherze entered the courtyard, he sent his men out to the remaining barracks to eliminate any stragglers. Reaching into the back of his cowl, he pulled out a black furled cloth. Unfurling it revealed the flag of the Luminous Ones, the skull painted with radium paint. Planting and raising the flag on the lone flagpole at the center of the fort, Gherze pulled out his warhammer from his back sling. Extending the handle and head of the hammer, he drew the hammer back as far as it would go, harnessing all possible power he could, both from within, and provided by his Luminous Armor, to slam it as hard into the ground as he could.\n\nA shockwave emitted from the strike, nearly on par with a minor earthquake. Glass shattered, wood smashed, the unarmored humans and ghoul soldiers of Black Canyon stumbled and fell, whilst the Luminous forces remained steadfast, their armor protecting them from the effects of the strike. As the rhythmic echo of the hammer strike became silent, the burgeoning silence was instead met with the enormous roar of the Luminous Ones, upon seeing the flag of their nation raised high into the air."
