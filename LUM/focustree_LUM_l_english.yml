LUM_burst_of_energy_desc:0 "Beyond healing and empowering our fellow Enlightened, the waves of invisible energy that can be released by a Glowing One (and a necromancer in particular) can sear the flesh of the Unblessed. Practicing this technique can create a formidable weapon, withering the bodies of our enemies as their untouched flesh fails them."
LUM_unyielding_control:0 "Unyielding Control"
LUM_unyielding_control_desc:0 "The Weakwilled and the recently resurrected are often somewhat aimless, especially in the confusing din of battle. Firm direction and guidance, backed by the authority of one's Luminous Flesh, is invaluable in focusing violence at the critical moment.

LUM_atomized_armaments:0 "Atomized Armaments"
LUM_atomized_armaments_desc:0 "It can not be understated how often we fight foes for whom radiation is a deadly threat.

LUM_establishing_local_counts_desc:0 "Managing the local populations we come across is, frankly, a difficult task. By elevating worthy individuals to the position of Count, we can establish an aristocratic class that can manage the local affairs of the state and free up resources at the capital."
LUM_assigning_priests:0 "Assigning Priests"
LUM_assigning_priests_desc:0 "While matters like construction, raising armies, and taxation can be handled by the local counts, they must be watched over by spiritual advisors to ensure they do not deviate from the faith. This will remain the right of the King."

LUM_repair_the_prison_desc:0 "The Big Top hasn't been used for its original purpose in quite some years. One of our advisors has come forth with a plan to rebuild it the prison as a home to the Penitent, all those vile souls of the Canyon who refuse to even consider our offers of salvation. They, and soon any other dissident in the realm, will find redemption in labor as they improve the region for the faithful."

LUM_a_just_indignation_desc:0 "Is it not righteous of us to be upset at our situation? We who were deceived and denied our home, the rightful birthplace of our faith? Who have the lands we have come to encroached upon by strangers from far off land, pillagers looking to steal from the bones of the World That Was? Who have had our every effort at aiding the faltering souls of ghouls stuck in a meaningless existence beneath a withered flag rebuffed without question? Do we not deserve more?"

LUM_dirtybombscleansinglights_desc:0 "While ghoulification is usually a long, drawn-out process of careful conversion, our enemies are giving us few options. While it will be difficult to sneak them into enemy territory, blessed materials strapped to heavy explosives in the correct manner can irradiate a town in minutes, transforming at least part of the population into ghouls. Likely dim bulbs, of course, but if we fail here many others will be denied salvation."
