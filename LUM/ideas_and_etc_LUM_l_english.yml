  lum_singular_faith_desc:0 "The Luminous Ones comprise a collection of ghouls that follow the teachings of the Great Glowing One, who preaches that radiation, the Holy Glow, if a gift to mankind and ghoulification is its grandest blessing. One that must be shared, by force if necessary. In this way, all of humanity will share in Eternity, the unending existance.

  ##Characters
  LUM_THE_GREAT_GLOWING_ONE_NAME: "The Great Glowing One"
  LUM_THE_GREAT_GLOWING_ONE_DESC: "None can say for sure who the Great Glowing One was before he appeared travelling the wastes as a preacher, perhaps not even himself. Emerging from the glowing sands around the Dead Man's Junction, he travelled far and wide to gather followers and bring them back into the Glowing Cradle. There he taught them about the importance of the both radiation, the Glow, and their "condition", ghoulification, the Blessing. Seeking to share the Blessing and usher in an Eternity of existence and peace, he leads his followers to convert as many humans as possible and free them from the ravages of time and disease.\n\nUnder his enlightened rule, of course.\n\nTo say this has not made him popular among the surrounding societies is an understatement, but many have already become devout fanatics of his beliefs, and having been tricked into Colorado by the Glowing Father may well be the push to begin a self sustaining Nuclear Struggle."

  LUM_aushnat_decay:0 "Aushnat Decay"
  LUM_aushnat_description:0 "Aushnat was not always the menacing loyal general to the Great Glowing One. He had once been a family man before the Great War. Although he never truly had the opportunity to live the American Dream, he sought to ensure his legacy would be continued through his kids, and that he could leave this world, knowing he had left it better than when he had been brought into it. Being ineligible for the draft, as well as general employment, due to underlying medical conditions, Aushnat was left with unemployment benefits and severance checks to keep himself and his family afloat. This made him a prime candidate for the rapidly growing Free States movement. Though Aushnat was not wholly anti-American, he did not deny the extra income he got from attending their events, getting paid to sit at a chair and get asked how the government had treated him to various locals.\n\nHe began investing in survival shelters, a fallout shelter under their garage, a Pulowski shelter in the kitchen, a lead-lined basement, and, if all else failed, a refrigerator, completely encased in lead. But none of these truly prepared Aushnat for the Great War. Though his family had all been present, due to it being a Saturday, none of the measures he had taken truly worked.\n\nThe Pulowski refused to accept the quarters thrown at it, remaining sealed. The basement's lead lining had been cheaply installed, resulting in peeling paint and horrid smells. The refrigerator was locked from the outside, and the youngest of his children had lost the key entrusted to him. The only aspect that remotely functioned was the fallout shelter, which had absolutely no food, medicine, water, or any other essentials. For this reason, each of his family members dared to venture throughout their newly hellish situation to search and scavenge. But all of them fell victim to the radiation storms that had picked up in the region.\n\nAushnat alone was only exposed to enough radiation to ghoulify him, watching as each of his other family members either turned feral, passed away, or simply never returned. He kept waiting for the radiation to take him, as it did his family, but it never did. After decades of sitting in his fallout shelter, unaware of how much time had truly passed, he was astounded to see another ghoul, much less one that was glowing as he was, offering him a new purpose, and a better life..."
