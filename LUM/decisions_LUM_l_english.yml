Only a handful of groups (and their leaders) in our domain have shown themselves worthy of the title, and so they come before the Throne to kneel and swear fealty in return for prestige and supplies. Living life to a specific Ideal, each is unique in their own way, and contribute something different to our military strength. While the numbers they can field are few, limited by their high standards for acceptance and gear, they may make for a potent sword in the days to come."
  LUM_special_knights:0 "Order of Radiated Blades"
  LUM_special_knights_desc:0 "Trained tirelessly in the martial arts of swordsmanship, honing their skills to defend the Great Glowing One and vanquish the forces of radiophobia that plagued the wasteland. Adhering only to the Codex of Bioluminescence, written by Radiumosa, the Blades hone themselves through the combined powers of faith in the Great Glowing One, courage in their victory, and honor above all else. In times of peace, the Blades become missionaries, trading their swords for sermons, yet are quick to defend themselves using their uranium-lined blades, and armored with lesser versions of the Great Glowing One's armor."

  LUM_metal_knights_desc:0 "With the presence of the Iron Alliance, the Baggers, and other Power Armored friends and foes within Colorado, it was no wonder that sooner or later, groups who were trained in the art of the Armor of Power were bound to pop up to get what they could out of the Luminous Ones sooner or later. Though the Umbrals were unlike the many charlatans, who only had mere frames dressed up in metal and scrap to look like a serious suit. The Uraninites had discovered a depleted uranium dump, and, in a fit of what they deemed genius, decided to make suits of armor from it. While the effectiveness of their armor barely passes T-45, the radiation protection, and especially the radioactive damage it inflicts on attackers, more than makes up for the weakened protective capabilities."

  LUM_aqua_knights_desc:0 "Becoming one with the Patrons is no easy feat, not only due to their encyclopedic knowledge of every issue of Tæles of Chivalrie, but also in their expertise in every manner of honorable conduct, from combat to diplomacy to stewardship. While their leadership is publicly headed by Sir Plasmelot, who excels in the art of wordsmithery and craftsmanship, the actual decisions and tactics are decided by Maiden Bess, whose boggy Nebraska upbringing and unfortunate partial infection and subsequent treatment of the New Plague makes her unsightly and unladylike for all but the most truly knightly Patrons, but a mastermind in planning the most effective way of out-thinking and out-fighting foes, especially near waterways and nuclear bog and swampland, a territory she has become very accustomed to, and is more than happy to be the first in, and last out."

  LUM_car_knights:0 "Order Of Combusters"
  LUM_car_knights_desc:0 "Before the Great War, Colorado boasted approximately 8 million cars. After the Great War, 90% of those cars ceased functioning. Permanently. But 10% of 8 million is 800,000. And out of those cars, the Combusters formed. Mechanists, gearheads, hot rodders. Anyone with knowledge of how a gear wrench, tire iron, and Corvega work (properly, not just banging them until they work) is welcome. The only problem is the remaining 90% of the cars, which remain prevalent throughout the roadways of Colorado, clogging up highways, tunnels, and even dirt roads alike. The Combusters, while they created slightly ingenious methods of dealing with them, such as repurposing bulldozers and combine harvesters into car pushers and grinders, still have yet to even make a dent in that number.\n\nBut even Gearheart recognizes that the Combusters likely will never find a place in Colorado going it alone. For that reason, he seeks to turn to another group, one that will welcome him and his boys (and girls). And the Luminous Ones may just be the screwdriver to set Screwloose right..."

  LUM_enforcer_knights:0 "Knighthood Of SWVT Forcement"
  LUM_enforcer_knights_desc:0 "During the early epidemic of the New Plague, the Plains Commonwealth, unlike the many Commonwealths around it, decided to institute mandates not unlike those seen in horror and thriller films, such as zombie movies. As a result, by the time of the Great War, the Plains Commonwealth law enforcement, from basic officers to the highest SWAT agents, looked as though they had stepped out of the screen and into the real world. However, all of their training against the infection could not prepare them for the average American, nor could it stand up to the reality of nuclear war.\n\nAs the decades went by, and the meanings of the world "police" and "SWAT" were forgotten, a band of prospectors, seeking respite from the ever-worsening infected areas of Nebraska, now becoming known as the Plaguelands, came across a nearly-untouched police precinct just outside the walls, complete with a SWAT convoy. However, not recognizing the meanings of these words, the head prospector took the name as their own, renaming themselves as Po Lice. Their forces, believing the worn away A was actually an upside down V, became the SWVT. From that point forward, they spent time keeping the peace outside the wall, with the automated turrets of the wall recognizing them as Pre-War law enforcement. That was, until the coming of the Necromancer..."

  LUM_bulb_knights:0 "Holy Order Of The Snareulz"
  LUM_bulb_knights_desc:0 "The Dim Bulbs don't just spawn from thin air, as much as some people believe or wish they would. Though the Necromancer dreams of one day learning the means of perfecting the art of bringing a Dim Bulb to the Light, for now, he must rely on outside help to bring in feral ghouls from inside and outside their territory, a job he has delegated to the Snareulz. Their chief motto? "To capture a feral, you must think like a feral." And being almost entirely ghouls (among a few radioactive-immune humans), no one knows this better than them. But bringing in Dim Bulbs only satisfies a certain craving, while giving birth to a far more potent one. While Sn'ere knows he will never rival the Necromancer, he takes solace in occasionally acting as a field commander for the Dim Bulbs, enhancing their tactics, abilities, and even giving them the semblance of intelligence to an untrained enemy eye. To him, they may be the Dim Bulbs, but he's a Bright Bulb leading the way."

  LUM_super_mutant_order_desc:0 "Super Mutants may be feared throughout the wasteland for a number of reasons, but if there's one art that they've somehow all attained some level of proficiency in, it's animal taming. From the alien Floater and brainless Centaur, to the fearsome Mutant Hound, Super Mutants maintain a high, if brutal, level of loyalty expected from their pet, rewarded by the pet being brought along to die with their owner. Snoupy's group is different in that they adopt and retrain the pets abandoned or lost by their former masters, human and mutant alike, and train them to serve not only as fierce protectors, but loyal companions and friends as well. For this reason, Snoupy has pledged his allegiance to the Great Glowing One in exchange for seeking a personal responsibility for finding a pet worthy of the Necromancer. In the meantime, his "Snoops" continue their mission of training and befriending the many animals of the region."

  LUM_medical_order_desc:0 "While the missionary days of the Great Glowing One are behind him, he still wards a devoted base of priests and priestesses dedicated to bringing the light of the Luminescence to the light-starved masses. Yet the light of religion is only as effective as the light of leading a way through darkness. For this reason, the Beacons have taken it upon themselves to use their abilities, learned or natural, to provide medical assistance to those they come across, be it providing a Stimpak to an injured traveler, bestowing a Glowing One's miracle upon a lifeless Dim Bulb, or simply irradiating a meal for consumption. Although the Beacons are largely peaceful, they too have been enveloped of the Necromancer's militant ways, resulting in a new, smaller Beacon group, led by Bioluminess Brielle, to serve both on the battlefield, and off it in field hospitals, as a form of 'Green Cross'."

  LUM_dungeon_of_conversion_category:0 "The Chamber Of Ascension!"
  LUM_dungeon_of_conversion_category_desc:0 "Dug into the stone of the Red Mountain are a series of dungeon cells, built to hold prisoners and test subjects for the Great Necromancer. Many perish here, but even in death they provide new revelations for his uncounted scrolls of Ghoulish knowledge. Those he most favors, however, are brought to the vast chamber its heart where he can personally oversee their conversion unto unlife - and convince them to kneel before the King of Ghouls.\n\nEach individual only has a certain chance to survive the process, although the careful ministrations of the Revered Necromancer means they have better odds than normal. Continuing his studies into the effects of §OBODY§!, §0MIND§!, and §eSOUL§! on the process will surely improve the chances of success. To lack in either of these areas means the risk of common death, ferality, or worst of all - blasphemous defiance!"
  LUM_feral_old_dog:0 "Teaching An Old Dog"
  LUM_feral_old_dog_desc:0 "Once Old Dog had been receptive to the Great Glowing One, when he had made his pilgrimages through northern Colorado seeking recruits from the Dog City outcasts. If Old Dog had only been wiser, more level headed, listened to the teachings.... he could have been an advisor.\nA friend.\n\nNow, he will kneel. Or he will §Rbreak§!."
  LUM_ghoul_agnes:0 "An Offer To The Dying"
  LUM_ghoul_agnes_desc:0 "Goddard and Coleridge were unsalvagable. They had to be punished for invading Colorado and defying us. There was another influential leader among the Californians however. Doctor Agnes is an inquistive mind, and her popularity and knowledge would bolster us. Even better, her §Obody§! is failing her: a sickness slowly consuming her, and not even her medical knowledge has a cure.\n\nBut whatever it is, Ghouldom would halt it completely. Radiation, pure and bright, will save her, if only she will accept the King's authority."
  LUM_ghoul_pierce:0 "Own Our Hitman"
  LUM_ghoul_pierce_desc:0 "Captain Pierce, they say, is a dangerous man. With his rifle, he can kill a man at a thousand paces. Even better, he can make it hurt. He's left a trail of blood across the battlefields of the Powderkeg, and such talents could prove valuable indeed.\n\nA simple thing, then: tear off the Bear and replace it with our flag instead. A brief treatment, and he can be a Hitman for Eternity."
  LUM_ghoul_jim:0 "A Matter Of Mechanics"
  LUM_ghoul_jim_desc:0 ""Uncle" Jim is perhaps the most impressive of those upkeeping machines for the Expedition. With his age catching up to him, an offer of a future may prove frutiful. If that doesn't work, he also seems faint-hearted. While blunt, blundgeoning one into submission is always an option, if they survive the process. Afterall, we're not just gaining a follower - we're saving their soul."
  LUM_ghoul_bulleteater:0 "Breaker Of Arrows, Eater Of Bullets"
  LUM_ghoul_bulleteater_desc:0 "Bulleteater was well on his way to becoming his own legend, for the tales of the power armored troops he forged out of the Iron Arrows speak highly of their talents. It was good that we crushed them before they became an even greater threat. Now if only we could get into the state of §0mind§!, we could surely find a way to convince him how he could be more than remembered for all time - he could LIVE for all time!"
  LUM_ghoul_mcbride:0 "Meaner Than McBride"
  LUM_ghoul_mcbride_desc:0 "This ruthless raider of Tibbet's earned his spot at the top of his little clique by being the meanest fellow in the yard. Now that we're here, however, he'll be forced to learn some humility. And failing that, he can be conditioned to take his violence to the outer edges of our territory. That's if his aged §Obody§! and §0mind§! are capable of passing through the process unscathed."
  LUM_ghoul_inkhouse:0 "The Armour Of Contempt"
  LUM_ghoul_inkhouse_desc:0 "While many of his primitive rites contradict with ours, these things can be corrected. Spiritual education of the misguided masses is ever our duty. What truly matters is this talent the tribal possesses for crafting armours from the hides of Beasts. If combined with our own metal working, our Knights could look fearsome indeed."

  LUM_ghoul_confessor_desc:0 "These followers of Atom are so close to the truth - and yet, so far. Their falsehoods can not be allowed to proliferate. Turning their Confessor in Wyoming to the truer Faith will bring the others into the fold, in time. His §Obody§!, however, has proven unusually resistant to the effects of radiation. While this presents a challenge, it is a secret the First Necromancer is most eager to delve into."
  LUM_ghoul_davis:0 "Baron Of A Newer Age"
  LUM_ghoul_davis_desc:0 "Davis Keyes was called a Baron of Brahmin when we came to these lands. A key mind for business and a wealth of connections interest us more than the animals, which shall be tended to now by the faithful. It is certain that he shall see the light and take our side now that the Watch can no longer protect him - should he prove strong enough to cross the Luminous Rubicon."
  LUM_ghoul_cork:0 "A Lost Soul"
  LUM_ghoul_cork_desc:0 "This poor Glowing One has not had the company of his own kind - or at least ones he could commune with - for some time now.

We should welcome him into our congregation gladly."

  LUM_ghoul_annette_desc:0 "A particularly ambitious sort, these Bailey's. The daughter is young, but her fiery §esoul§! burns with the desire to make her mark on the world. Indeed, it took no small effort to dig out her and the resistance movement she was formulating to take back the family estate. If the sermons can but reach her heart, this fire could be put to use burning out heretics and disbelievers."
  LUM_ghoul_savannah:0 "A Childhood Snake In The Garden"
  LUM_ghoul_savannah_desc:0 "When we captured the young Bailey, this one was not far away. A slippery, conniving sort, with a knack for working in the shadows of the world that might prove useful - at least until all that exists is bathed in Light. No particular skill we have aid in her conversion more than any other, but her loyalty to §YAnnette§! runs deeper than she admits. Perhaps we can use this bond to inspire her?"
  LUM_ghoul_baresteeth:0 "Courage For A Hound"
  LUM_ghoul_baresteeth_desc:0 "Once, this man in front of us was one of the most feared rulers in Colorado. From the scrap rich Dog City, his gang and their hounds were the dominate force in the state and pushed out all who opposed them. Now, bound to a stone slab under the Great Lord's ceaseless gaze, he shows his true nature. Without his dogs, he is all but powerless. With careful words and potent tinctures, though, we can fortify his §esoul§! for the next step. When the Hangdog runs again, it will be with his flesh as blessed any in the kingdom, or not at all."

  LUM_ghoul_mechanist_desc:0 "Armoured not as a knight but as a madwoman, the one calling themselves the Mechanist put up fierce resistance when our forces approached the Robot City. There are many in our ranks who remember the old comic books from before the Mushroom Clouds. Perhaps one too many, for their seems to be some desire amoungst our commanders to both spare Deborah Wallflower and allow her to continue to take up the mantle of the Mechanist. Will the Great One indulge this curious quirk? Will she survive her transformation into an undying ghoul? Find out next week: same Luminous time, same Luminous channel."

Still, while faith alone keeps us marching into Eternity, the might of troops in such shells would suit us well. This "Brotherhood", now broken, has long kept the secrets of maintaining PA in working order to themselves. It would be well worth the effort to bring one of them into our court to show us how they do so. Once the resistance of their §0mind§! is broken and their obediance confirmed, of course."

  LUM_ghoul_azkee_desc:0 "The children of Mesa Verde has spent centuries preserving the mathematical formula and detailed schematics of their ancestors. Such honed minds are wasted in their current existance. Their Counter has shown some ambition to bring them out of a tribal existance, but they lack the strength that we possess to truly rise above. Once they bow before the Uranium Pits and embrace Ghouldom, we will show them the way forward."

  LUM_ghoul_johari_desc:0 "Once, she was the wealthest woman in the Last Redoubt of the Plaguelands. No easy feat, considering how little there was to go around. We will scourge her of her greed, and in turn she will hand over to us the secret of her little chemical called "GRIN".

However, this does not mean they can be left entirely to their own devices: besides frequent reminders that they serve at the will of the Great One, the King will find it prudent to signify specific interests to dictate the fate of our subjects.\n\nIf we were to send our most trusted §XPriests§! to personally oversee the realm, they could focus on the political wellbeing and quelling discontent, all while utilizing the truths of the Glow; not least of all, Necromancy. Their focus on the heavens will also extend to rebuilding aircraft to strike down non-believers from the skies.\n\nOn the other hand, an easy solution would be to hand out privileges to the §GMerchants§!, allowing them special permissions to develop and exploit the territory in return for a portion of the profits. While less concerned with the spiritual wellbeing of the new citizens, the chance to fill our coffers is considerably tempting, and they will surely comission a great number of naval vessels to control the water routes.\n\nLast but not least is the option to grant complete authority to a §RMargrave§!, a trusted military commander who will place the defense of the kingdom above all else.
