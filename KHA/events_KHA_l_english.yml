  nf_new_khans.1.t:0 "Parting of the Ways"
  nf_new_khans.1.d:0 "Our history is one of dark deeds often rewarded with near extinction, though few of us choose to recognize it. In California, our people nearly met their end twice at the hands of those who now rule the west. Those who survived our second defeat were scattered to the winds, and only the actions of two men stopped the New Khans from dissolving into nothing in the following days. One such man became known as Papa Khan, who gathered the bulk of the survivors, giving them new strength and remaking them into the Great Khans. They traveled east into Nevada, until they settled in the Mojave Wasteland and established themselves as a mighty tribe once more. \n\nThe other man was named Amgalan, and he gathered both survivors and hopefuls, trying to hold them both together. His group was much smaller, and were aided by a group known as the Followers of the Apocalypse. Given food, water and medical attention by these outsiders, Amgalan felt obliged to return the favor in some way; so when the Followers planned an expedition far to the northeast, he and his splinter group of Khans walked with them on the road. They still called themselves the New Khans, and they looked southward towards their ever more distant kin with..."

  nf_new_khans.2.d:0 "The road that the New Khans and Followers walked was long and winding, passing through many strange and dangerous lands. They journeyed under the suspicious and watchful glares of rangers, through the territories of those who walked on tar and into the settlements of those who spoke for the gods of the heaven above and the steam below. Where the Followers were not welcome, Amgalan and his companions would step in to intimidate or fight them out of danger. The two groups became friendly enough along the way, but it was Amgalan himself who would begin to pay closer attention to the words and deeds of the Followers. \n\nWhile the rest of his clan drank or brawled in the night, Amgalan would speak with the Followers or read the collection of books and holotapes they carried. He began to question whether it was the land or the Khans that needed to change. It was a slow and quiet change within him, but as the expedition reached the far off lands that had once been Wyoming and Montana in the days before the bombs Amgalan was a changed man. Those around him noted the change as well, though the rest of the New Khans were less convinced by words of peace and healing and continued much as they did before. Before the end of the expedition they'd gathered..."

When they stopped, we did as well, putting down new roots and making a home for ourselves. The ground upon which we stand now had been loosely settled by scattered ranchers and tribes who either moved south or joined us upon our arrival. Since those first days, we have dispersed across the flats and prairies into small groups to hunt and take what we need. Though Amgalan still stands as our leader, his authority is only loosely acknowledged, so each family of Khans largely does as they see fit. \n\nOne of the tribes pushed southward by our arrival was known as the Sun Gazers. They left without making a fuss, taking their herds towards the Eyrie of the Baron. Their eyes were still skyward when Bailey decided the herds and fields would see better use under his own watch. The poor bastards didn't stand a chance and were wiped out. One daughter of their tribe journeyed to us, a blood-soaked and grim-faced woman named Esen, looking for a new home. A single new recruit would not normally be very noteworthy but Amgalan immediately took an interest in her, calling the woman..."

  nf_new_khans.4.d:0 "Before the still-burning ashes of Baron August's manor stood Amgalan, the warmth of their war keeping the nightly frost from his skin. Though his silence would imply such a thing, the clicking and crackling of the embers brought him no peace. \n\nThe Khans had traveled thousands of miles in search of Wyoming-- a paradise land with supposed tall-tales spun by the Followers. Amgalan was the one who shepherded his people from Papa Khan, and brought them here. Though it was beautiful, and the land itself still rich in spite of nuclear calamity, this was the opposite of what he had hoped for. \n\nThe Baron was a monster: this he could not dispute. Those under his boot made it clear enough that such a thing was inevitable. But it was still Amgalan who allowed more Khans to die. The land may be safe now, but it shouldn't have been secured through these means. It was the exact thing he hoped to take them away from, and yet now the children who were born along the way now knew of this sort of bloodshed firsthand. \n\nFor a moment, he wondered if perhaps they had been too greedy-- that maybe they took too much, and thus shook up the land and inspired war and murder in the hearts of the people. But ultimately, Amgalan settled on one conclusion:"

A morning breeze brushed against them cozily, the smell of morning dew bringing a smile to the old Khan's face. \n\n"You think it is foolish, do you not?" he asked Esen, holding his journal close to heart. \n\nShe grunted. "They crave a strong hand, not a strong system, Amgalan." \n\n"A strong hand can come from within just as much as without. We don't need a despot, or a sole progenitor, Esen. The Khans have grown too large for such simplicity." \n\nEsen grumbled at that for a moment. "Do you think they feel that way?" \n\n"Some do, some do not; but still, they choose to listen to me. Here, we can forge an actual future for our people-- the sort the governments of the west do. With the Baron gone, well... We can afford some room to grow." \n\n"Try not to break your own people in your hopes, then, Follower." she said, taking a seat by him. \n\nHis hand reached out to her, holding a small bit of jerky. "For your health." he said with a hearty chuckle. "And for joining us.""

  nf_new_khans.6.t:0 "The Baron's Daughter"
  nf_new_khans.6.d:0 "Amgalan stepped into the old Baileytown jail, home once to a number of largely innocent but unlucky folks and now playing host to only a handful of people who’d had a part in the war against the Khans. Members of Zack Company’s leadership, a few of the worst of the Baron’s thugs, and Annette Bailey. When the flames consumed the Bailey home and the Baron himself, his daughter had surrendered to Amgalan and the rest of the Khans forces. A few had called for her to be killed on the spot, blaming her for the bloodshed but the old chief had refused. She’d spent the days since in prison while the Khans had come to grips with the situation but now the guards had passed on a request from her to meet with Amgalan. Once he’d arrived she wasted little time in making her proposal, standing at the bars with a charming smile across her face.\n\n“Good morning Amgalan, I’ve been looking forward to meeting you in less violent conditions. You’ve got fair enough reason to hold me here, I am the child of your enemy after all, but I want you to know that I can do a lot more for you if given my freedom. I know the families of the Eyrie better than anyone, their strengths and even their weaknesses, and I can encourage their cooperation with you.” She studied the old Khan’s face before adding “With my help peace and prosperity will return quicker, and isn’t that what we all want?”\n\nAnnette punctuated it all with another smile, and Amgalan granted silently that her words and voice were charming enough. What he wouldn’t credit yet was her sincerity. After a pause to think, he responded:"

  nf_new_khans.31.t:0 "The Baron's Daughter, PT. 2"
  nf_new_khans.31.d:0 "Later that day Amgalan called to his tent Ezekiel, former agent of the Baron who’d been imprisoned for his opposition to the war against the Khans. The two men had met when the old Khan had released most of the prisoners in Baileytown prison and quickly built a rapport in the days since. Ezekiel had become Amgalan’s best source of information about the Eyrie and its people and once again he was hoping Ezekiel could provide him enough to make a good decision about whether to accept Annette Bailey’s offer of help. “You know her better than anyone else I suspect, and I value your opinion. What should be done with the young woman?”\n\nThe other man lit a cigarette and thought for a moment before answering “Smartest move is probably to leave her in her cell if’n I’m honest with you boss. I don’t wanna throw any wool over your eyes, Annie is a sneaky one and has a bit of a mean streak to her. She’s also smart as a whip though, knows everythin’ about the Eyrie and she knows the war is over. She can do what she says.” Ezekiel removed his hat to rub the back of his head and added in a bit lower of a voice “I’m also plum fond of her boss, and I’m more than willin’ to help keep her penned in and behavin’ if you give her a chance.”\n\nIt was a plainly laid out answer, and Amgalan was confident Ezekiel was no liar. It was time to make a decision:"

  nf_new_khans.32.t:0 "Another Proposal"
  nf_new_khans.32.d:0 "Ezekiel was home in Baileytown for the first time in many months, come a calling on Miss Annette Bailey. The Bailey estate had long since been repaired, though the staff was considerably fewer in number. He tipped his hat towards the grave of Augustus and walked inside, where Annette was quick to emerge and embrace him. They exchanged more than one kiss in greeting before Ezekiel pulled back a bit to speak “Been hearin’ good things Annie, been stayin’ out of trouble?”\n\nShe scoffed and rolled her eyes a bit “I haven’t cheated your boss if that’s what you mean. Much.”\n\nHe knew better than to say that the Khans were her boss too, instead telling her “Got a thing or two for you then.” First he produced a fine sundress in pale lavender, reclaimed from a faraway prewar storefront he’d discovered on a scouting trip. Annette’s eyes gleamed as she looked it over but the gift was quickly forgotten when she looked up to see Ezekiel down on one knee. She was incredulous, even more so when he held out his calloused hand to present her with a ring.\n\nHer face softened as she looked into his one eye, “You really do love to get yourself into trouble don’t you Zeke?” He responded with a winning smile and a shrug, waiting for her answer. She smiled back, slyly and said to him:"

  nf_new_khans.7.t:0 "The Whiterabbit's War"
  nf_new_khans.7.d:0 "A war has broken out on our borders, though this time it has little to do with us. In the hills to the west of our territory two small factions have begun skirmishing in earnest. On one side stands a clan of hulking super mutants, the likes of which we recognize from our days in far flung California. They are recent arrivals much like us, but have kept to themselves so far. On the other are The Men of the Woods, strange folk who have been here long before us. They worship a white horned rabbit and have been hostile to our scouts and settlers in the past.\n\nWe are unsure what has sparked this conflict but already the fighting has spread towards our holdings and several hunting parties have been caught in the crossfire. As long as this goes on we will have no peace in the west. Amgalan has sat down with some of his most trusted people to make a plan on how to approach the issue, and it’ll be best we make one soon."

  nf_new_khans.71.d:0 "Amgalan was led into the dilapidated mining office that Mogul called home, Esen at his side upon her insistence on coming along. The super mutant leader spoke in a loud voice that sometimes shook the ragged window frames but his words all held a heavy tiredness “Hello Khan Master, it’s good to meet you. My people told me you’re here to help us.”\n\n"Here to hear you out at least. The Jackalope worshippers are less than pleasant neighbours for us as well. I must know however, why do they fight you?" The Khan leader answered, his heart heavy at the prospect of more battle.\n\nMogul waved an arm in the vague direction of his enemies, clearly exasperated “I’ll be damned if I know. Sometimes they shout stuff about holiness and curses but they’re definitely nuts.” He sighed before adding “We’re tired of being pushed out of everywhere we go, you wanna help or not Khan Master?” Esen fidgeted next to Amgalan, clearly not comfortable but still hoping that he’d agree to fight. On the old Khans part, he had paid close attention on the way into this makeshift village; most of the mutants he’d seen were scarred, wounded or looked downright exhausted. They reminded him of his own people."

  nf_new_khans.72.t:0 "Meeting in the Woods"
  nf_new_khans.72.d:0 "Esen marched into the cult leaders grove, where a bonfire burned bright enough for even her to see clearly by. She was alone at the rabbit worshippers' insistence and kept a hand near her axe in case things took a turn for the worst; they wouldn’t take her down without a fight. From the shadows he came, the smell of blood, hide and wild mushrooms preceding him. Skeeter the Raved approached her until he was uncomfortably close, swaddled in pelts and with a rack of antlers strapped to his back. “Sun Khan wants to be friends does she? Help us take back the holy hills from the giants?”\n\nBeing referred to as Sun Khan took her by surprise; she’d had no idea the cult knew anything about her history as a Sun Gazer. She forced it from her mind however, instead thinking back to just how many of the rabbit men she’d passed on the way to this meeting. It was many more than the Khans had estimated, which was concerning but at least it validated her push to try and make allies of them. Finally she responded “As long as the people of the Rabbit will be friends to us in return.”\n\nNarrowed eyes over a cheerless black toothed smile was the response, followed by “Maybe, maybe. We have no weak friends or liar friends. You must prove your true strength!”"

  nf_new_khans.8.d:0 "Reports from our scouts have come in, delivering some very intriguing and unexpected news. A familiar symbol to those of the Mojave, of swords and gears, has been seen flying over the mountains of Montana. The symbol of the Brotherhood of Steel, they tell us, whispering about armoured soldiers and hidden bunkers. It appears this group of the Brotherhood, however, is far more open with its existence, and in the midst of a power struggle.\n\nTheir warriors, known as the Sisters of Steel, seem to be defying their traditions and digging their roots deep into the land, helping its people and tribes. Though it is too soon to ascertain their intent, many within our tribe who follow the teachings of Amgalan and Regis look to these Sisters as potential friends in this land, and kindred spirits. Time will tell if this is true, but for now, we watch with hope that the leader of the Sisters, one known as Honour, will extend the olive branch, instead of the laser pistol."

Seems like they're just a bunch of great shitheads.”\n\nShe threw her hands up, grunting angrily. “They don't listen to us. They chug booze like it's a goddamn sport and make the entire camp smell like a lab. What are we going to do about them, Amgalan?” \n\nHe shrugged in faint agreement, “We must earn their respect. They don't fully understand that we're their family, yet.” \n\nHer eye twitched. “We gave them somewhere to go! Isn't that enough? Now they're up here, running our shit into the ground, and we're supposed to just accept that?!” \n\n”Hearing what they've been through, I don't think I blame them.” Amgalan rested his chin in his hand, “We all get restless in times of strife. We just have to be there for them, and guide their hand.” \n\n”But this isn't just restlessness, Amgalan. It's recklessness. They're self-destructive. They want blood, and I don't think they'll stop until they get it.” \n\n”Many of us do; just look at Esen, or even myself,” Amgalan said, watching her expression turn to one of surprise."

Revenge, anger, they both divorce the mind from the body. They take your character and make you into a shell.” his eyes lidded with tears, “I won't let them go through that.” \n\nIt took Falaya a moment to gather herself. “Then you know this is bad, Amgalan. This is a whole new set of Khans who haven't changed like we have.” \n\n”I know that,” he sighed, placing his hand on her shoulder. “Regis and his people are good. If they weren't, I wouldn't have let then come here.” he softened his gaze, hushing his words. “We can understand them, be there for them, without agreeing with them.” \n\nShe took a deeper breath, eyeing him with concern. “I just want you to think about it, okay?” \n\nHe nodded, and she left him to his thoughts..."

Some she’d had to bury, killed by booby traps or in ambushes; the Saints had proved reluctant to face them in an honest battle. The campaign had left her increasingly frustrated and irritable, and more than one tree had suffered as she let out steam. Now though Esen had finally found their hideout in the wilderness, thanks to information squeezed out of an unfortunate captive.\n\nRemembering what they had suffered at the hands of the Saint scum Esen and her warriors waited until the cover of night, until most of the Saints were passed out drunk or high. After midnight they stormed the old hunting lodge, Esen booting in the doors and leading the way room to room. They met little resistance, the raiders they met being ill equipped to fight back, and it was a slaughter rather than a battle. She was a ghastly sight as she left, covered in blood, and lit the place on fire as she went. The Saints did not return, any left in the Woodlands quietly retreating back to their fellows at the country club."

After all, a muscle-bound man with words like silk riding on a motorbike would seem a once-in-a-lifetime beauty to those whose paths he crossed. \n\nBut those days came riding harshly to an end when a mysterious traveler came through and murdered Darion. \n\nAmgalan did his best to help those who survived the assault, but he just couldn't do enough. Too many died that day, and yet only one thing brought him sorrow: had they lived any other life, perhaps they'd have lived to see another day... though raiding and robbing came at such costs. \n\nBut the Khans changed with time. They became less of a gang, and more of a tribe-- and so a spark of hope kindled in his heart. The Followers were a group that he had met before, and with their help, he thought perhaps they could start again. With luck and time, perhaps he will be proven right..."

Folks tired of blood and going it alone, who wish for comfort and stability. They would see Amgalan’s role not just preserved but expanded so his authority is unquestioned.\n\nSome have been drawn to Esen, captivated by her talk of guarding against further disasters through overwhelming strength and impressed by her conviction. These followers wish for a return to glory and even revenge against a harsh wasteland. They’d see her raised to the top and speak of the kind of Khanate old Darion would have only dreamed of.\n\nBut there are others who wish for no great changes at all. They want to raid, live, and continue on as the Khans always have. The Great Khans and particularly Regis have become examples for these traditionalists to rally around, and they hold that it may be time to give Regis a greater position of honour amongst the Khans as a man who also is worthy of leadership.

The tents had been burned, the stores stolen, and the people had fared even worse.\n\nMost seemed to have had their throats cut in the night and their bodies posed in various positions as if it was a joke. Several had been dismembered and at least one Khan's head was nowhere to be found. Numerous empty booze bottles had been left scattered around the one intact tent; on its side was painted the logo of the Saints, a gang from the other side of the Woodlands.\n\nAmgalan was cold, not showing his fury or disgust, while Esen was the picture of barely contained rage as she paced about the ruin.

This had been the very heart of the NCR, of bear country, but long ago the Khans too had been born in this land. Born and nearly died twice.\n\nRegis didn’t recognize any of it but it put an odd mood over Amgalan, a nostalgic one. He’d never planned to come back.

Esen was at his shoulder, curious about the site after all the stories of battle and having fought her own share to help them get here. To her it felt like the area echoed with anger and smelt of the dead. This was Bitter Springs.\n\nIt was a name that had only become more accurate in recent years, but the place belonged to the Khans once more. It looked quite small now, difficult to picture as home to much of anyone. Those who had stolen it were long gone now, and so was almost everything else.

Getting on his bike and kicking the tired and protesting motor to life, he rode away from Darion and into the open roads alone.\n\nMuch of the highway had been cleared in recent years, making for an easy ride under clear skies. He swerved gently between forgotten pre-war vehicles and rolled past a number of Free Khan homesteads that were beginning to dot the countryside. The road took him past the Followers main headquarters, and though no one marked his passing he raised a hand to wave at them anyway. Eventually he came to a crossroads, with one side doubling back towards home and the other taking him further away.\n\nHe trusted Justine, Esen and Regis and decided he'd earned some peace and quiet to himself.

Each found they enjoyed the other’s confidence and company, and the trip had felt like light work. It was Melissa who eventually found the nest itself and counted the monsters, and both had agreed to tackle it head on without delay.\n\nWhen it was over both were unscathed and surrounded by bloodbug corpses, each regarding the other's handiwork with respect.

We’ve been raiders in the past, sometimes without much reason to it. In the end though, we’re just doing what we have to to survive.

She’d found the attacker.\n\nIt was a short trek to a rocky cliff edge, where Regis found a group of Khans Melissa had left behind surrounding a strange figure, dressed in all black, with the skull of a vulture on their head. Several of the Khans were already laying in the dust, pools of blood growing underneath them, giving cause to the hesitation of the rest. Regis, however, did not hesitate; drawing his machete, he marched past the group and stood ready against the shawled menace. Brandishing a blood stained knife, Hickey lunged at Regis, a mad scream filling the air. Weaving away from his enemy’s strikes, Regis danced around the mad attacker, his past conflicts giving him an experienced edge over such a mad opponent. He watched, he waited, until the moment presented itself to him. Hickey slipped briefly on a pool of blood, and in that second of imbalance, Regis struck with expert strength and precision befitting a Khan warrior. His blade passed through until emerging from Hickey’s back before Regis kicked the mad killer back off the weapon, sending them tumbling from the cliffside.

You lost a lot and we gave you a chance, a home. Trying to scam us? It's not right, you’re out of here.”\n\nSilence fills the shop, the hanging sound of shame and acceptance.

Amgalan began the night at his normal position of honour but it was not to last. After gathering everyone’s attention he stood and addressed them “It has been many long years since I first hit the road with you, my kin and friends, and just as many that I’ve acted as your leader. It’s time however that I make this official and step out of the way for someone new to make their mark. May all the Great Khans, no matter what roads they took to get here, acknowledge their new Khan of Khans.” He gestured towards Regis and stepped back “Regis, the future is yours and I have full faith in you.”\n\nAmgalan moved to a quiet corner of the room and sat, applauded politely by the crowd as Regis raised his voice to speak both to him and those gathered. “Thank you, Amgalan, for everything you did to get us here. It won’t be forgotten. To you my friends, I’d like to say I’m proud to step into this position. I know you, and I know what we’re capable of. We’ve had a lot of hard times but those are behind us now and this is our new home, the Great Khans are here to stay!” He punctuated the short speech by raising his fist towards the sky, and the Great Khans responded with their own fists and cheers.\n\nThere was little else to say, Regis was not a long winded speaker and the Great Khans didn’t need much more. The gathering became a celebration of Regis’ ascension and many times he found himself clapped on the back and called Papa Regis. He’d not expected the title but"

Some days they would work out of old books borrowed from the Followers, on others Amgalan would carefully write out messages in the dirt or on old papers. Today they moved along the old prewar roads, Esen tasked with reading the signs left behind by the people of bygone times. She was having difficulty however, often giving up and asking the older Khan to give her a hint or outright tell her what was written. At first Amgalan took her struggling to be the result of wear and tear on the signs, but soon he suspected something more. Finally he asked “Esen, how well can you see me?”\n\nShe hesitated, looking away, before replying in a flat voice “You are blurry. You always have been, but it has been getting worse.” It was obvious how much it pained her to admit to it.\n\nAmgalan laid a gentle hand on her shoulder, reassuring her before saying “I will say nothing of this to the other Khans if you wish my silence, but I strongly suggest that we ask the Followers for their aid. At the least they may be able to slow it down.” Esen gritted her teeth for a moment, irritated at the idea of asking for help from anyone, but in the end she took a deep breath and responded evenly:"

In the last few weeks however the Followers had spoken to her and Amgalan of a procedure they hoped could reverse the damage to her eyes. Their improved equipment and technical information recently garnered from old pre-war facilities would make it possible, they claimed. While in the past Esen had been quick to decline aid, this time she accepted their proposal without hesitation, laying down on the surgical table without fear. Amgalan had a hand on her shoulder as she went under, and he observed the whole affair with great interest.\n\nThe operation went smoothly, and the Followers were confident that after some time to recover that she’d be in good shape. Several days later they were finally ready to remove the bandages over her eyes. By her side were Melissa and Amgalan, one anxious and the other confident, both ready to help in case of trouble. It shocked Esen to see how sharp the world was, how clear the features and expressions on their faces were. She let her guard down then and with tears streaming down her face she embraced each of them in a tight hug. In Amgalan’s ear she whispered “Thank you.”"

Midday would call their attention; an hour for prayers with eyes skybound. When dusk settled, everyone bowed their heads, wishing the great sun goodbye as it left them for the night. \n\nFor a large portion of her life, Esen knew only the sun. She was born under its loving embrace. She worked tirelessly to impress when it surveyed her people during the day and under cold nights, she would watch the stars—the servants of the sun—as she waited for its return. But when passing faces slowly dwindled to blurred features, when her own hands became hard to recognize, she began to wonder if she'd wronged it, her people, or anyone for that matter. \n\nThe aftermath with the Baron had proved her suspicions. She managed to survive a grenade blast by positioning; a taller Sun-Gazer stood in front of her, taking the brunt of the shrapnel. And when Esen had finally mustered her strength—both of will and might—to crawl out from the bodies and rubble that toppled her, she was alone. She was the last. \n\nSlick in warm blood and soot, the sun was unbearable and sweltering. It welcomed her with no love this time.\n\n'WEAKNESS,' Esen felt it bellow, and she understood."

Revenge and the lust for it weighed too heavily on some of the Great Khans and a few chose to seek their fortune on their own, prompting another parting of the ways. Regis for his part however knew that seeking vengeance would be the death of them all and discarded the idea.\n\nRemembering old stories from Papa mentioning a group of New Khans who had struck out on their own long ago after the fall of Darion, the Great Khans headed north in hopes of finding their long lost cousins. They could think of no better course with both east and west growing more and more dangerous. The journey was a tough one, with the travellers forced to dig up long stale rumours and scrabble for supplies the whole way. Not a few times were they forced to fight as well, as the wasteland and its often hostile inhabitants took its toll on them. By the end of it, Regis felt:"

The scouts had kept their distance on Amgalan’s orders, instructed to stay as far away as possible while still keeping the travellers in sight. The old chief had an odd feeling about it all, feeling strangely excited. The rest of his people were ready for a fight and were already taking up defensive positions if it came down to it but Amgalan had every intention of asking questions first. He biked up onto an old ridge overlooking the trail, Esen clinging behind, and waited for the new arrivals to approach. \n\nThey were wary as they came, walking slowly but openly, clearly aware that some kind of welcoming party was awaiting them. It was a large group of people, including adults and children alike, most wearing various leathers and scavenged clothing and many carrying weapons. They kept their arms at their sides and backs however, a detail that Amgalan did not fail to notice. Once they were within earshot Amgalan called out “Who are you, so many walking into the land of the Khans?”\n\nThe response was an unexpected one:"

They’d actually managed to find their long lost cousins and they’d been quick to welcome the Great Khans of the mojave, after an initial period of intense and surprised questioning. Many of the Northern Khans had seemed impressed at the tales of their southern counterparts and happy for the sudden reunion, though Regis wasn’t sure yet what to make of it. The conversation inevitably turned towards their hosts.“That Amgally guy seems nice” Jack offered, his arm draped around Diane as they passed back and forth a cigarette.\n\n“A bit too nice” both Melissa and Diane countered, almost in unison.\n\n“He still looked pretty buff, bet he could chuck me pretty far. Bet his Esen lady could too.” Jack shrugged.\n\n“I do like her,” Melissa said, smirking as she watched the fire dance. “Hey Regis you know I get the idea a lot of these guys want a new boss. Why not you?” Regis didn’t answer right away, considering her words; It was true that some of the Khans they’d met seemed to have little love for their soft spoken chief.

Stories of long distant cousins had brought them north, in search of friendly faces and a safe place to call home. The trail of old rumours had slowly led them here. It had something of a bad reputation but so had many of the roads they had walked to get this far.\n\nThey travelled warily but not as much as they perhaps should have. As the Great Khans entered a low trail under high ridges a voice called out asking who was trespassing in the Eyrie. When Regis called back in response that they were the Great Khans the voice came back “I don’t know if I see anything Great but we know what to do with Khans.”\n\nAfter the voice came a hail of gunfire, which rang out through the hills until all that was left was silence."

His voice was even but she could hear that it was a struggle to do so as he continued “They are denouncing your warpath and actions and will do no more to help you.”\n\n“Is that all?” Amgalan was silent in response. “As long as they stay in their posts and keep running themselves ragged caring for every weakling with a limp I don’t care how much they whine and cry.” The slump in Amgalan’s shoulders was clear even to her poor vision and the unspoken implications only made her more irritated. Finally she asked “Are you leaving too?”\n\nHe sighed and replied in a tone rich with sorrow “No, I am here until the end. The Khans are my people. I will never abandon them, even if I find myself disappointed in them.” He turned to leave but hesitated at the flap. “That same goes for you.”\n\nOnce he was gone, Esen sat in the dim tent alone with a scowl across her face. The Followers move wasn’t really a surprise; she’d known this would come eventually and yet it was still frustrating. She didn’t linger long however, Melissa and Ezekiel were waiting and there were war plans to discuss. The True Khans had a long way yet to go."

There was nothing left to see within it, except for some dim shadows that she couldn’t be sure weren’t her imagination. Straining to see something, anything, soon began to give her a headache and she stopped. Outside she could hear the sounds of her warriors rising to meet the day, training, eating, a little brawling. It was comforting.\n\nThrough the tent flap she could smell smoke, sweat and alcohol on the wind, the normal smell of a True Khan warcamp. She rose and reached for her axe, standing in its usual place, grasping the head and using its butt as a cane as she stepped outside. There was only the vaguest sense to her that she’d stepped into the daylight. Bitterness rested on her shoulders; she would need to inform her generals that her vision was gone entirely. She’d told Melissa in private that it had been getting bad, but she wouldn’t be able to pretend with the others anymore.

Much to the Khan scouts' horror the beasts even spat caustic fluids at them. It was the Followers of the Apocalypse with their books of old world fauna who’d eventually put a name to them: Radllamas.\n\nThey’d been left well enough alone since then, but with the Khans having mastered the art of riding horseback some had called for trying the same with the llamas. It had taken several months as well as several would-be handlers and riders but soon the first llamamen were ready for battle. Two Khans could ride together on one of the massive beasts, one with the reins and one carrying a long rifle, and swiftly they proved a terrifying force to any petty bandits or wild creatures causing the Khans trouble.

They were books and tapes demonstrating and explaining a musical technique known as throat singing. Of special note was that the technique was advertised as being from a far flung land called Mongolia and practised by the Khans of the Old World.\n\nWith that in mind, the practice rapidly became a hit with Khans both of the north and hailing from the Mojave. Most surprising to all was how naturally both Esen and Melissa took to the technique. It became a common sight to see the two of them practicing and coming up with new songs together. Before any great trips into danger the two would sing for their warband, granting their warriors extra fervor and courage before the battles to come."
