  KHA_AMGALAN_NAME:0 "Amgalan"
  KHA_AMGALAN_DESC:0 "“I have a lot of faith in my people, that they’ll also see how bright the future could be.”\n\nThe road to where Amgalan now stands as the loose head of the Northern Khans was a long one. Decades ago he rode the wastes as a playboy punk, raising a ruckus and breaking hearts under Darion and the rest of the New Khans. When Darion met his fate and the Khans fled California, Amgalan led a group away to join an expedition of the Followers of the Apocalypse. After many years, miles, and not a few battles both groups arrived in the open wilds of Old Wyoming. Settling down with the intent of putting down roots for the first time in their long diaspora, the Khans have a chance to take a long breath. Much older and (he hopes) wiser now, Amgalan remains the de facto chief though many of his kin have misgivings about his increasingly passive and restrained demeanour. The road changed Amgalan, though it remains to be seen whether it changed the rest of the Khans much."
  KHA_AMGALAN_SECOND_DESC:0 "“Decades of trials and disasters for the Khans have led them here, where they had a choice in whether to move on or stay the course. To my great joy, we shall move on.”\n\nThe Khans, both those of the north and recently arrived from the south, have made their voices heard and much to the joy of their chief they have called for a new and peaceful way. Amgalan through his efforts and determination has convinced a people already fatigued by long exodus and bloody conflict that there can be a better way. He will be afforded little rest though, for now he has to put his money where his mouth is and prove it. The man has little doubt however that with the support of his kinsfolk, the Followers of the Apocalypse and any new friends that remain to be made he can do just that. The future is finally looking bright."
  KHA_amgalan_advisor_desc:0 ""It is a very special individual who gets what they dreamed of and I am not very special. I have enough of what I need however and I will care for my people as I always did, that will not change."\n\nThe years have begun to finally make their weight felt on Amgalans formerly sturdy shoulders. His dreams of teaching the Khans a new way of life are spent now, surrendered in the face of his kin wishing to follow another. They are still his people however and nothing could change that. So he wakes each morning and does what he can, whether the administering of medicine, tutoring the next generation of Khans or acting as a liaison to those who end up subject to the Khan of Khans will. Tomorrow is after all another day, and it can still be better than today."
  KHA_ESEN_NAME:0 "Esen"
  KHA_ESEN_DESC:0 "“Wasteland took enough from me, from the Khans. Never again. We’re the ones who take from now on.”\n\nIf nothing else, the Khans respect a warrior. Someone who will not back down in the face of threats and insults or allow themselves to be victimised. A true leader of Khans must be ready to spill a river of blood for their people. Esen is such a warrior, such a leader. The last of the Sungazers and now Khan of Khans, she is a woman hell bent on not only bringing the Khans glory to last the ages but also ensuring that she will never lose another tribe. She still has much to prove however and those who stand in her path would do well to give way or prepare for war."
  KHA_ESEN_ADVISOR_DESC:0 "Few have extended words to share about Esen, as she is a relatively new member of the Khans herself. She's made a steadfast reputation at Amgalan's side, expressing disinterest in what she perceives at stagnation in favor of a conquest befitting of the Khanate."
  KHA_REGIS_NAME:0 "Regis"
  KHA_REGIS_DESC:0 "“The Great Khans are on the way back up. We always bounce back, and always will.”\n\nThe one time right hand man of Papa Khan has been forced by cruel fate to rise to the occasion and lead his people out of disaster. Now he has risen once more, placed in a position of power to aid the Khans of north and south in becoming one. He does not speak with full authority as of yet, Amgalan still holds a nominal position above him, but Regis has found quick support among both of the Khans' camps. It is a difficult tightrope to walk, to try and please everyone while following his own heart as well. He has good counsel to aid him however, and his pragmatic approach and even temper will serve him well in this work."
  KHA_REGIS_SECOND_DESC:0 "“Welcome to the lands of the Great Khans, I am their Papa.”\n\nIt has been a winding path marked with many losses and trials but Regis stands now as the Khan of Khans. The loyalty of the Khans who’d walked the long road north with him was never in question but now even their northern cousins willingly acknowledge and support his leadership. Amgalan has stepped aside peacefully to make room for his successor and ceded all authority. It took a savvy and patient man to reconcile the Khan's identity crisis but Regis has reminded them all what it means to be a Khan, not just in the past but moving forward. They were once adrift but finally the Khans have a Papa once more."
  KHA_regis_advisor_desc:0 "“The Khans have been Great in the past and I know they’ll be Great again no matter what we call ourselves. We’re not gonna get knocked down again.”\n\nIt is almost a relief to the man who took up the mantle of leadership in a time of crisis to set it back down. Though those he led through the wasteland will always hold him in a place of honour, the Khans of north and south are already beginning to mix and mingle under new leadership. Now Regis himself settles into a familiar and comfortable role, serving as an advisor, strategist and lieutenant for his new chief. He’ll keep things under control and make certain that those Khans who escaped Bitter Springs don’t get the short end of the stick."
  KHA_ATRARIS_NAME: "Atraris"
  KHA_mogul_name:0 "Mogul"
  KHA_mogul_high_command_desc:0 "Mogul was a wanderer for a long time before he found his way to Wyoming. Once a higher ranking member of the Master's Army, he still retains a great amount of tactical knowledge. With the Khans, he has an opportunity to finally become a part of something bigger once again."
  KHA_ambercoza_name:0 "Paladin Ambercoza"
  KHA_jaye_name:0 "Jaye"
  KHA_jaye_advisor_desc:0 "When Amgalan's Khans and the Followers were passing through Nevada, they ran into ex-Ranger Jaye. They had forsaken their titles out of a desire to remain free of the NCR and of Abigail's thirst for vengeance, and so when they had met Amgalan, they were beleaguered and alone. Jaye spoke with Amgalan and the Khans as they rested for a few nights, learning more and more about Amgalan's glistening dreams for what the Khans could be. \n\nThey were no friend to the Khans, once-- but now, they've spent a long time with them, enough for them to be kin."
  KHA_justine_name:0 "Justine Walker"
  KHA_justine_desc:0 "“There’s so many opportunities out here, to build something beautiful and bright in the wastes. We owe it to the world to light the way.”\n\nNot many of the Followers in Wyoming actually remember California, thanks to the many years since the expedition set out. Justine is no exception, having been born during the long and winding journey to a Khan mother and Follower father. She’s always taken after her dad however, and was raised among their caravans of books and medical supplies rather than the Khans raiding camps. She considers herself to be a Follower of the Apocalypse above all things and believes strongly in their mission. A researcher and doctor, with a wide breadth of knowledge taken in over the years, Justine’s primary role is to act as the liaison between Khan and Follower as the two groups remain friendly but separate. The bulk of her time is spent with Amgalan, and she has grown increasingly attached to the old chief."
  KHA_DOOMFIRE_NAME:0 "Doomfire"
  KHA_DOOMFIRE_DESC:0 "As he was recovering from another trip, Doomfire was surprised to find himself in an unfamiliar place — and even more so — surrounded by the Khans, not the Fiends. He wanted to take some Jet to clear his mind from this weird realization, but Regis explained to him that the fiend had asked very enthusiastically to go with them, which Regis had ended up allowing.\n\nDoomfire was sad that he'd left his home behind, but that sadness disappeared as he drowned it out with another dose of jet. He realized that he had a new destiny:to become Regis's right-hand man and offer the Khan the brilliant ideas his stoned brain generates. Regis felt no need or desire to change Doomfire's mind, and since then he often visits Regis with his (mostly idiotic) ideas."
  KHA_knight_avery_name:0 "Knight Avery"
  KHA_knight_avery_desc:0 "“Honestly I like it here a bit more than back home with the Sisters, don’t tell them that though.”\n\nThe Brotherhood of Steel in Montana always had its share of colourful characters, and Tasha Avery is little different. Daughter of raiders from the east she takes after her parents both in her aptitude for violence and penchant for wild celebrations, though she has often been chastised for both. This led to her frequently being placed on scouting and reconnaissance duty alone until the recent management change at the top of the chapter. When she heard Honour was looking for a volunteer to act as liaison to the Khans she jumped at the chance. After all, they have a dual reputation as rough and tumble warriors as well as chem brewing wizards. Sounds like a local culture she’ll fit right into."
  KHA_TOOTHLESS_HANNIBAL_NAME:0 "Toothless Hannibal"
  KHA_TOOTHLESS_HANNIBAL_DESC:0 ""
  KHA_zeke_henries_name:0 "Ezekiel Henries"
  KHA_jessie_monroe_name:0 "Jessie Monroe"
  KHA_jessie_monroe_desc:0 "“Don’t mind Gidget, she only nibbles people she likes. If she don’t like you, trust me you’ll find out.”\n\nEnclave, murderer, hero, hermit; Jessie ‘The Hellshark’ Monroe has worn many hats throughout the years. Nothing has really satisfied her for long. Dozens of operations as a soldier of the enclave lie in her past, but she deserted from MacArthur many years ago after growing increasingly dissatisfied. She spent the years since living in the wilderness alone but for the wild geckoes she took a shine to, eventually learning to tame the little critters. Now with a new power rising in old Wyoming, one that could perhaps even go toe to toe with her former employers someday, she’s decided to don the old shark painted armour once more. The Khans and their Union seem like decent enough folks after all. She’s bringing the geckos along though, unless someone really wants to argue with a soldier in hulking power armour."
  KHA_booth_desc:0 "“Strange to be a father among khans. The gods make strange plans.”\n\nBooth Crow, formally a ‘Father’ of the Four Fathers tribe, has found a new home with the Northern Khans. An intelligent man who understands the need for both violence and diplomacy, Crow proudly wears the story of his people woven into his hair, for he can think of no better way to honour their memory. After meeting with Regis, Crow now offers his skills to the Khans, ensuring that what happened to his tribe does not occur again in his new home."
  KHA_wayles_desc:0 "Wayles Thomas, once of the Four Fathers, now stands as both an advisor for the Northern Khans. Strong willed and stubborn, yet detesting all forms of violence, her agreement to work with the Khans only operates on the promise that they would try and be better than those who slaughtered her tribe. Time will tell if that promise is genuine."


  #Characters

  KHA_jessup:0 "Jessup"
  KHA_chance:0 "Chance"
  KHA_chance_desc:0 "Chance is a member of the Great Khans and a survivor of the Bitter Springs Massacre. He is considerd by many a veteran of the clan, and a ruthless warrior, showing no remorse as he cuts his foes down one by one"
  KHA_mcmurphy:0 "McMurphy"
  KHA_mcmurphy_desc:0 "McMurphy was born member of the Khans, and has bags of experience leading small bands of the clan members on raiding missions deep into enemy lands."
  KHA_the_armorer_name:0 "The Armorer"
  KHA_the_armorer_desc:0 "“Hand it over, I’ll get it fixed.”\n\nKhans without their weapons are far from defenceless but they might feel a bit naked. For the Mojave Khans, the woman known only as The Armorer ensured they always had a stock of killing tools and leathers in reserve. She is an enigmatic figure otherwise; the subject of many rumours amongst her peers and keeping to herself and the armoury. In Wyoming she does much the same as she once did, having quickly proved her skills to the northern cousins, just now it’s on a larger scale. Khan politics pass by her without notice, as she’s content to always be cleaning the next gun or sharpening the next blade."
  KHA_oscar_velasco:0 "Oscar Velasco"
  KHA_oscar_velasco_desc:0 "Oscar Velasco was one of the few soldiers at Bitter Springs the day of the massacre, and fought bravely with his fellow Khans until they were totally overwhelmed. Oscar managed to survive due to his unique sniper abilities, allowing him to cut down the NCR troopers who attempted to follow him up the narrow mountain passes."
  KHA_melissa_lewis:0 "Melissa Lewis"
  KHA_melissa_lewis_desc:0 "“I’ll miss dad and Papa but honestly between House and the NCR the Mojave kinda sucked. I think we got a good thing going here.”\n\nMelissa is a young woman unbowed by the wasteland despite having faced her fair share of battles and strife. The daughter of a Khan and a man of the NCR, she went through the tough initiations of the Great Khans and is not a proud and loyal member. In the time since she’s been a raider, a hunter, a courier, a scout, a warrior; whatever the Great Khans needed her to be. Melissa’s heart is sparked by chances for glory and she often dreams of greatness both for her and the rest of the Khans.\n\nNow the Mojave, and her father, are far behind her to the south and she has a new land to scope out and roam. Among the Northern Khans she already jockeys for a position among the warband leaders and has found a kindred spirit in the fiery Esen. She would never turn on Regis after he led the way north but as long as she gets a chance to prove her skill and reach for greatness she doesn’t much care who’s in charge."
  KHA_samool_name:0 "Samool"
  KHA_samool_desc:0 "“Give me some asses to kick and pass the whiskey, I’m gettin’ bored.”\n\nAs the Followers of the Apocalypse and Amgalans band of Khans wandered the wasteland they frequently were forced to clash with various raider gangs and hostile tribes. Usually this meant a few skirmishes before the Followers hurried on in hopes of safer locales but there came a year where they were effectively besieged. Samool was a young man when his gang, named the Eyebiters, under their leader took an interest in the Followers stocks of chems, meds and other supplies. For a full year the expedition was trapped in an old series of mineshafts, unable to move in large numbers without being attacked.\n\nThe siege was broken when Amgalan himself led a group to surprise the Eyebiters at their camp and killed the cannibal gang's leader in the night. Many of the Biters scattered or began infighting in the days after but some were impressed enough to join the Khans (though any cannibalism had to be left behind). Samool was one such recruit, and has grown into an effective war leader and skilled warrior in his own right. Nowadays however he misses the old Amgalan."
  KHA_jack_name:0 "Jack"
  KHA_jack_desc:0 "“Hey man you need anything? I can get you up, bring you down, level you out.”\n\nThe Khans have not had too many members like Jack; soft hearted, laid back and a natural chemist, he is the yin to his partner Diane’s yang. Responsible for keeping the Khans of the Mojave and their clients stocked with “The Good Stuff”, he spent most of his time cooking or kicking back. He didn’t find the trip north all too groovy, though he’ll give Regis credit for getting them all through it. Much happier to have arrived in Wyoming, he’s finding the Northern Khans to be “pretty cool daddy-o” and kinda digs getting to hang out with the Followers again. They may be a little uptight, but they’re still pretty sweet and remind him of his old teachers back when he first learned chemistry. Jack’s not too fussed about what comes next, as long as he and Diane are together."
  KHA_diane_name:0 "Diane"
  KHA_diane_desc:0 "“This place has potential, but we’re gonna need to find some new clients sooner than later.”\n\nDiane is a business woman first and foremost, though she’s not afraid of cracking a few skulls if need be. The yang to her partner Jack’s yin, Diana organised much of the Khans business deals and chem deliveries back in the Mojave. Now that the long exodus is over, Diane has wasted no time in making new contacts and putting out feelers in neighbouring lands in search of new clients. If it was up to her things would stay business as usual, just like back in the old home, and the caps would keep flowing. She’ll settle in the end for whatever keeps her and Jack comfortable though."
  KHA_anders:0 "Anders"
  KHA_anders_desc:0 "Anders is and always has been a Khan, making a name for himself as Diane's most trusty drug runner. Together the trio—Diane, Jack and Anders—control the vast majority of the Great Khans' drug trade."
  KHA_jerry_the_punk:0 "Jerry The Punk"
  KHA_jerry_the_punk_desc:0 "When Jerry was a child, the Followers of the Apocalypse came to Red Rock Canyon with pre-War books. Jerry used to spend hours reading these books, especially poetry books, and has consequentially grown into the role of the Great Khan's poet—writing epics about the victories of the Khans."
  KHA_emma_winslow_name:0 "Emma Winslow"
  KHA_emma_winslow_desc:0 "“I half expected us all to die on the road or find no one left up here. Turns out I’m a lot luckier than I thought.”\n\nWhen the Khans fled the Mojave most seemed happy to see them go, and bid them good riddance. Some saw an opportunity though, and Emma Wilson is one such person. Remembering old records mentioning a Follower expedition that had gone beyond contact far to the north with Khans alongside them decades ago, she gambled that going with these Khans would lead her to them. Offering to care for the sick and wounded along the way, she was accepted by Regis as a tagalong. Now in Wyoming she’s happy to find the Followers not just alive but thriving, and has latched on to Amgalan and Justine as her guides to this new land. Talented with wires and circuits she has hopes of one day building or repairing a broadcast tower to get back in contact with the Followers branch she left behind, but until then she’s happy to keep lending everyone a hand."
  KHA_falaya_name:0 "Falaya"
  KHA_falaya_desc:0 ""Travelling is nice and all, but life on the open road is a bit overrated. Give me a chance to take my time with this place and I’ll blow you away."\n\nOne of many Khans born on the road during the long migration, Falaya was born of the union between her Khan mother and a father from a now forgotten tribe. A nomadic existence is all she has known, only stopping in one place for a year or so at most, but the arrival in Old Wyoming feels like an opportunity to her. Always prone to working with her hands, the prospect of settling down and building something meant to last is almost intoxicating. Fond of the Followers, she plans to absorb any knowledge that they can teach her and hopes to stay busy building for years to come. "
  anders_lar_trait:0 "Anders"
  KHA_barons_daughter_desc:0 "“I imagine my father would be choking in rage to see all this, or a bit dumbfounded perhaps. The thought of that always cheers me up.”\n\nDaughter of the now deceased Baron of the Eyrie, Annette has been granted clemency by Amgalan thanks to the good word of Ezekiel. In exchange for her life and retaining somewhat of her old lifestyle, she has been tasked with keeping control of the Eyrie smooth for its new owners. While a part of her fumes at the indignity, Annette is no fool and will play ball with the Khans. At least she can look on the bright side that she’s got easy access to Ezekiel again now. Through her the Eyrie families are easier to control and the ranches and workshops continue to work smoothly, even if now the workers actually have to be paid. She has also given the Khans limited access to her collection of secrets and informers throughout the region."

  # nf_new_khans.19.t:0 "Because I Love You"
  # nf_new_khans.19.d:0 "Illness had struck Amgalan.  The Followers' prognosis found nothing, but Esen recognized exactly what was ailing him, for it struck her too once a lifetime ago; heart break.  Jaye and Ezekiel carried the brunt of Amgalan's responsibilities while he wasted away in burnout.  Esen stayed by him.  Watching, protecting, waiting. \n\n But their recent losses surmounted what was gained.  His dreams remained dreams.  Esen could wait for him no more.  If his heart was beyond healing, then she would forge him a new one. \n\n The night was young when she found him.  Sat alone in his candle lit tent, Amgalan was buried in his textbooks—scriptures he'd read before, hoping for answers that didn't exist.  Esen draped a forgotten blanket over his shoulders and rested her hands down firmly to keep the fabric there.  He glanced at her, his eyes sunken and thankful. \n\n “We need change,” she began.  His gaze dropped, but they both expected this.  “And I've been preparing for some time.  I just need your blessing.” \n\n “What if I said 'no?'”  He murmured. \n\n “Will you?”  She replied. \n\n Amgalan inhaled, shuddering.  “Promise me you won't take it too far.” \n\n She wasn't sure what he meant, but the difference would not change her answer.  “I can't make any promises,” she said.  “But everything I do will be for us.  For the Khans.  For you.”"
