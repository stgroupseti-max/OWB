  #War Council

  KHA_khan_war_council:0 "War Council"
  KHA_khan_war_council_desc:0 "As the cold war between the Montana Brotherhood and Macarthur Enclave rages on, those stuck in-between the clash of giants have a limited window of opportunity. If we act fast, we may consolidate our power before we face the wrath of two powers."

  KHA_ncr_teachings:0 "Old Foe"
  KHA_ncr_teachings_desc:0 "Khans still remember the victories we had against the fledgling republic. In fact, Shady Sands cowered in fear of our mighty warriors for years. Day by day, the Republic grew, evolved and surpassed our might. In our hubris, we refused to be anything but petty raiders, thinking we could hold the wasteland hostage for decades. While some yearn for the good old days, some are intelligent enough to realize, another defeat may be the last one for the Khans."
  KHA_ncr_teachings_tt:0 "§MAtraris' studies about NCR military will grant us insight on how to raise a modern army from scratch.§! \n\n §REsen wants to reform our military to our glory days under Darion and to remind what happened to those who messed with the Khans.§!"

  KHA_ces_teachings:0 "New Ally"
  KHA_ces_teachings_desc:0 "We know little about the Legion, outside of being allies of convenience. Despite their numerous ranks and ferocious loyalty, legionnaires are no match for a Khan. At least on a fair fight, that is. Legion employ cowardly practices such as sabotage and trickery coupled with human wave tactics. While many of these practices go against our traditions, we can learn from our new "allies"."
  KHA_ces_teachings_tt:0 "§MAtraris knows the importance of military intelligence. Completing this focus under his rule will give bonuses to our intelligence agency.§! \n\n §REsen, who helped Legion on taking out some NCR camps on Mojave, wants to employ the terror tactics Legion utilizes at Mojave. Completing this focus under her rule will grant bonuses to our planning.§!"

  KHA_war_logistics_desc:0 "We are newcomers to the area, which made us easy pickings for those who knew the lay of the land. But our scouts identified few safe routes for our supply caravans to pass through. With a small investment, we can ensure proper logistical support for our troops."

  KHA_khan_common_ground:0 "Common Ground"
  KHA_khan_common_ground_desc:0 "Historians are not a warmongering people, relying on mercaneries for protection. What sets them apart from others is their desire to help others and nurture everything around them. They could be persuaded to aid our populace if we promised them safety.

  KHA_the_pen_the_sword_desc:0 "They say those who live by the sword, die by the sword. Atraris sees the futility of trying to build an empire through coercion and force.

  KHA_horse_not_brahmin:0 "The Dark Horse"
  KHA_horse_not_brahmin_desc:0 "For the average wastelander, a horse is nothing more than a wasteland oddity.

  KHA_this_does_put_smile_desc:0 "Perhaps Elizaveta was right, at least partially. The greatest happiness in the world is to vanquish your enemies, to chase them before you, to rob them of their wealth, to see those dear to them bathed in tears, not sitting idly while world around you burns."

Though their chief Amgalan has adopted a light touch, it’s clear that forty years apart haven’t made the rest of the Khans all that different. Welcomed with open arms, Regis already holds an outsized amount of influence among the Khans and has the freedom to act as chief in all but name. Might be in name soon too."

  khan_meet_amgalan:0 "Good Man's Word"
  khan_meet_amgalan_desc:0 "Amgalan has given Regis a very long tether, unwilling to go against the clear popularity he holds amongst the Khans. The old chief has much to say though, and Regis was always good at listening."

  khan_the_followers:0 "Our Old Acquaintances"
  khan_the_followers_desc:0 "The Khans of the Mojave were once friends to the Followers of the Apocalypse, though they eventually parted ways due to certain disagreements about how to use their teachings.

  khan_open_initiations:0 "Open Initiations"
  khan_open_initiations_desc:0 "The Great Khans have never been very strict about where we come from, anyone can be a Khan if they’re capable enough and want to be. Putting out word that our doors are open should draw in some folks to fill out our ranks."

  khan_our_heritage:0 "Our Heritage"
  khan_our_heritage_desc:0 "The Khans past is one of struggle, of ambition and willingness to spit in the face of those who’d control us, of getting back up when we’re knocked down. It didn’t always work out too well, but it’s who we are for better or worse."

  khan_meet_esen:0 "The Warrior"
  khan_meet_esen_desc:0 "Esen is a relative newcomer to the Khans but her fiery spirit and determination to protect her new tribe has garnered her more than a few admirers. If Regis is to one day wield the full might of the Khans warriors, he’ll need her respect."

  khan_mojave_guns:0 ""Shooting Sticks""
  khan_mojave_guns_desc:0 "In the Mojave the Khans had to fight frequently, whether it was raiding the NCR or facing off against cazador swarms. Many of our people learned gunsmithing on the side to keep us stocked and giving them better workshops to practise in will give us a leg up in supplying our fighters."

  khan_bigger_motors:0 "Bigger Motors"
  khan_bigger_motors_desc:0 "Out in these open plains and steppes there’s a lot of ground to cover. Motorcycles have been enough so far but it’s time to see about getting some of these old cars moving again."

  khan_our_spirit:0 "Our Spirit"
  khan_our_spirit_desc:0 "To be a Khan is to be a warrior, not many of us can’t take a punch and give one right back. That willingness to get right back into the fight when we take one on the chin is the Khan spirit."

  khan_who_are_the_khans_desc:0 "Regis once asked himself ‘Who Are The Khans?” Well he’s thought long and hard about it and come up with something of an answer. The Khans are the masters of this land, not just raiders or squatters in the ruins. That means something. It means that it’s the Khans job to keep this land safe and sound."

  khan_blowing_off_steam:0 "Blowing Off Steam"
  khan_blowing_off_steam_desc:0 "We’ve settled down a bit and staked our claim to this land but that doesn’t mean all the Great Khans are satisfied.

  khan_yellowstone_science:0 "A Walk in the Park"
  khan_yellowstone_science_desc:0 ""I went with Amgalan and a few others to see Yellowstone with my own eyes. It’s a hell of a place, I didn’t think they had forests like that anymore.

  khan_expanding_our_bag_desc:0 "Justine and Emma found a few more things in their explorations of Yellowstone than expected, alerting us to hidden stockpiles of various weaponry as well as formulas for a few new types of chems. Putting it all to use will take time, but it’ll be worth it."

  khan_four_fathers_tribe:0 ""The Fathers""
  khan_four_fathers_tribe_desc:0 "The Four Fathers are strange perhaps, and their religion stranger, but they are nothing if not straightforward. As long as they are allowed access to their gods at Rushmore they should make for trustworthy allies."

  khan_jackson_family_desc:0 "The Jacksons are a fiery clan, burning with spite and thirst for revenge. While that makes them dangerous neighbours, it also means that it’s simple to negotiate with them. If we swear to aid them in returning to their old homes, they will help us in return."

  khan_metal_mouths:0 "Metal Men"
  khan_metal_mouths_desc:0 "To the north are a gang of raiders quite unlike any we’ve met before; with limbs of steel and faces filled with machinery they’re an imposing sight. Their boss, a brutal man by the simple moniker of Steel Joe, is willing to deal with us however. As long as we don’t hold him back we can be allies, though probably never friends."

  khan_drugs_as_a_part_of_culture_desc:0 ""You can’t go this far, we’re not going to stand by and help as you start peddling drugs to every poor soul around. This is a betrayal of our mission!" Justine was furious and Amgalan was silent.\n\n"Your mission. We’re just giving people what they want and getting paid for it. Sorry if you can’t handle that, but we’re the Great Khans not the Khans of the Apocalypse." Regis kept his tone even but Justine grew redder in the face with each word until finally she stormed out of the room."

  khan_family_business:0 "Just a Family Business"
  khan_family_business_desc:0 "We’re more than just fighters, we’re arms makers and traders in our right. We can take both of those things and make a real industry of it, if we try hard enough. We’ll have more guns at the end of the day at least and that’s worth it."

  khan_gun_without_target:0 "A Gun Without a Target"
  khan_gun_without_target_desc:0 "We’ve got our arms production ramping up but as we stockpile weapons it does beg a question; who are we gonna use them on? Might be time to start taking a serious look at the neighbours and see if we can’t answer that question."

  khan_money_rolls_in:0 "The Money Rolls In"
  khan_money_rolls_in_desc:0 "Diane has been hard at work expanding our network of clients and the Khan’s products are known now from the Black Canyon to Calgary and everywhere in between.

  khan_honour_the_promise:0 "Honour the Promise"
  khan_honour_the_promise_desc:0 "A promise was made, and the Jacksons patriarch has come calling. Neil expects us to return their rightful lands to them, and in exchange we will be given their home in exile. Never let it be said a Khan’s word is false."

  khan_what_lies_beyond:0 "What Lies Beyond"
  khan_what_lies_beyond_desc:0 "We didn’t get this far without a fight, and there’s no chance we’re gonna keep going without a few more. We’ll need to be ready for whatever’s on the horizon, even if it’s wearing a whole lot of power armour."

  khan_our_heavies:0 "The Heavies"
  khan_our_heavies_desc:0 "Most of the Great Khans know their way around a fight, but some live for it. They’re some of our biggest and strongest, and putting those heavies in the right place is sometimes all it takes to end a fight. It would be smart to get them some of the best gear we’ve got."

  khan_papa_khan_legacy:0 "In The Name of Papa Khan"
  khan_papa_khan_legacy_desc:0 "The Khans of the south still bear the wounds of their defeat in the Mojave, the greatest of which being the loss of their Papa. Most had never known any other leader, and while his death was heroic they grieve nonetheless. Regis has proposed to raise a memorial to the man, and to change the name of old Darion to something more meaningful."

  khan_far_son:0 "Moles in the Yard"
  khan_far_son_desc:0 "Just to the south, raspy breathed monsters in black coats and brandishing metal claws have been forming into a horde that threatens everyone. It’s only a matter of time before their beady eyes are turned towards us, we shouldn’t give them the chance."

  khan_great_stampede_assault:0 "Collision Course"
  khan_great_stampede_assault_desc:0 "As we expanded to the north another force was expanding to the south. Calling themselves the Great Stampede, they’re a proud, warlike and strong people with a history of defying their neighbours. They’re practically Khans, and that means we’re not likely to stay at peace for long. Better to get in the first swing when they’re not looking."

  khan_montana:0 "The Winning Hand"
  khan_montana_desc:0 "The Brotherhood of Steel have never been friends of the Khans, and just like steel-clad cockroaches they seem to be everywhere in the wasteland. Montana seems to be no different. This time though it’s our turn to send them packing."

  khan_middlemark:0 "Closing Time"

  khan_macarthur:0 ""The Bug Men""
  khan_macarthur_desc:0 "Tales of the Enclave from back west have survived our long journeys from old California, of the black-clad bug men who wanted to kill everyone and take over the world. These ones aren’t on an oil rig but they don’t seem too different. We’d be doing everyone a favour if we did a little exterminating."

  khan_united_identity:0 "The One Tribe"
  khan_united_identity_desc:0 "The line between the Khans of the north and those of the south has gotten blurry over the past months. Despite the decades we’re all still kin. There really aren't north and south Khans anymore, just us."

  khan_the_true_heir:0 "The True Heir"
  khan_the_true_heir_desc:0 "Regis never expected when he led the flight from Bitter Springs to end up here, but here he is nonetheless. Amgalan has made it clear he will step down and make Regis’ authority official, and the Khans themselves are more than ready for it. The Khans have a Papa once more."

  khan_great_stampede:0 "The Horsemen"
  khan_great_stampede_desc:0 "Riding a horse is quite different from driving a motorcycle or moving on foot, the beasts have a mind all their own and not everyone is capable of mastering the skill. That being said, they are fine companions and there are many amongst our people jealous of those who have access to them. We must double our efforts to capture and tame the herds roaming the plains and steppes."

  khan_necessity_is_the_root_of_all_misdeeds_desc:0 "The Sisterhood is gone, dead at the hands of a madwoman who’s hands drip red with blood. Even if the Sisters had not been friendly with us, there was never any chance we’d be friendly with someone like Hayman. Get your guns."

  khan_the_unyielding_hero:0 "The Unyielding Hero"
  khan_the_unyielding_hero_desc:0 "Amgalan refused to surrender his ideals or hopes for the future and in time that led his kin to see him in a new light. The peace he sought was not the hiding place of a weak man, but the hard to reach goal of a strong one. Their respect for him grows by the day."

  khan_caravan_upgrade:0 "Caravan Expansion"
  khan_caravan_upgrade_desc:0 "With stability comes people, and with people comes trade. As we build up our new home in the north we find ourselves getting more of both, thanks to the increasing number of caravans coming through. We can of course encourage things along by setting up a few of our own as well."

  khan_amgalans_travels:0 "Amgalan's Travels"
  khan_amgalans_travels_desc:0 ""Even as my people put down roots around me, the call of the road rings loudly in my ears. I must see this land, and those lands beyond, and learn what there is to learn and meet who there is to meet. Don’t worry though, I’ll always come back." -Amgalan"

  khan_a_home_for_all:0 "A Home for All"
  khan_a_home_for_all_desc:0 "Justine laid out a crude map of the neighbouring lands, with red markings to show recent wars and battles. "Wherever we go, war never seems to change."\n\nAmgalan nodded and laid out another map, this time of Darion and the surrounding land. "There are ever those who seek to escape it. We can make room for them.""

  khan_a_home_for_all_2:0 "A Wealth of Goods"
  khan_a_home_for_all_2_desc:0 "The Followers more and more are integrating their operations into ours, building workshops, wells and scrap recycling centres. They’re not shy of sharing the fruits of such labours either, luckily for us."

  khan_amgalan_factory_2:0 "Artisan Goods"
  khan_amgalan_factory_2_desc:0 "There are many among the Khans who are skilled craftsfolk, able to create beautiful and useful things alike. Before they often made do with leftovers and scavenged resources, in tents that needed to be ready to move at any time. Now we can afford the luxury of building them proper workspaces and providing supplies to work with."

  khan_build_a_better_place:0 "Building a Better Place"
  khan_build_a_better_place_desc:0 "Falaya, one of our best and brightest, has long studied everything the Followers could teach her about the art of building and construction. Now however there is nothing left for her to learn from them, and she’s even started teaching them a few things. With her at the head of our building efforts our homes will one day be the envy of the wasteland."

  khan_factorio_is_too_expensive:0 "Industrial Machinery"
  khan_factorio_is_too_expensive_desc:0 "We’ve reclaimed a number of old industrial manufacturing parts from pre-war factories that have been scavenged recently. With a little help from the Followers we might be able to repair them for our own use and get some factories of our own."

  khan_realm_of_diana:0 "The Realm of Diana"
  khan_realm_of_diana_desc:0 ""To the south I found a place unlike any I could have imagined. A valley inhabited by the strongest and healthiest people I’ve ever seen, watched over by a mother named Diana. We spoke over several days, and she gave me gifts to share with you all." -Amgalan"

  khan_healthy_gang:0 "Strength in Health"
  khan_healthy_gang_desc:0 ""I met with Diana once more and she taught me much, secrets of medicine and conditioning even the Followers could only dream of. In exchange I have offered her the services of any of our warriors who wish to volunteer. Are there any among you who wish to see the valley?" - Amgalan"

  khan_follower_research:0 "Advancements in Medicine"
  khan_follower_research_desc:0 "Many Khans, both of the north and south, proved for better or worse to be quick learners in the field of chemistry and most have the Followers to thank for it. The Followers are always working to improve their craft however and if we encourage our own chem makers to lend them a hand who knows what breakthroughs we might make together?"

  khan_followers_support:0 "Putting Book Learning Into Practice"
  khan_followers_support_desc:0 "We need more than theoreticals to survive rad storms, plagues and droughts. Turning our knowledge into practical inventions is a necessary step of our development. Even if some of the Khans still want to use it to make weapons...."

  khan_followers_science:0 "Accumulated Research"
  khan_followers_science_desc:0 "The pursuit of knowledge didn’t stop when the bombs fell, working out of small labs and with scavenged goods the scientists of the post apocalyptic world marched on. The Followers were always keen to record and archive any advances they caught wind of and that’s still true today."

  khan_followers_laboratories:0 "Follower Laboratories"
  khan_followers_laboratories_desc:0 "A scientist needs a lab, though most these days could only generously be called ‘modest’. The Followers have better technology at their disposal than most though and still have much to teach. Computers make quite the difference."

  khan_followers_lost_medical_knowledge:0 "Lost Medical Sciences"
  khan_followers_lost_medical_knowledge_desc:0 "Melissa and Esen returned one day from exploring some of the more forgotten corners of our lands, with tales of an old pre-war research hospital still mostly intact. News that it was full of Stingwing nests did not hamper the Followers excitement over the find. They’re already making plans for reclaiming whatever knowledge it holds."

  khan_followers_ralston_manufacturing_plant:0 "Ralston Manufacturing Plant"
  khan_followers_ralston_manufacturing_plant_desc:0 "As our work in researching medicine and chems alongside the Followers continues, we’re finding that we need better facilities for actually making them. Converting an old plant in Ralston should be enough to start manufacturing more and more medicine from the local flora."

  khan_followers_agricultural_division:0 "Follower Agriculture"
  khan_followers_agricultural_division_desc:0 "Chemistry isn’t the only science the Followers study, far from it. One field in which their knowledge exceeds ours is agriculture. The Khans have never been known as farmers, but as we continue to settle down more and more of us have taken to the soil. If they’re willing to teach we’re willing to learn."

  khan_agricultural_advancements:0 "Agricultural Advancements"
  khan_agricultural_advancements_desc:0 "We’ve learned fast, faster than the Followers expected. Old farmland left fallow by the end of the world is rapidly being revived by our farmers thanks in no small part to the Followers knowledge. Feels a little odd though to ride a tractor instead of a motorcycle."

  khan_work_with_dealers:0 "Cutting a Deal"
  khan_work_with_dealers_desc:0 "Jack and Diane shared a seat as Justine heard the former make his pitch. "Check it lady, what you’re doing is totally cool, with the making meds and everything. We wanna help, we know all about getting the good stuff to whoever wants it. Just put in a good word for us with the A-man, tell him to be cool." \n\nJustine frowned briefly before shrugging her shoulders with a sigh. "Fine.""

  khan_force_dealers_out:0 "Chem Rehabilitation"
  khan_force_dealers_out_desc:0 "Diane took a long drag on her cigarette as she watched Amgalan open the first chem rehab clinic who knows how many miles. "This is gonna fuck our business over you know."\n\nJack shrugged from the old lawn chair he lounged in. "Maybe it’s time for a new business ya know? I can make other stuff, maybe make some scientastical stuff for the Followers." Diane shrugged in response, already thinking of ways to keep them in caps."

  khan_field_medics:0 "Field Medics"
  khan_field_medics_desc:0 "Nowhere does quick access to medical treatment make a bigger difference than on the battlefield. Training some of our people in field medicine and kitting them out for the job should ensure as many Khans as possible come home from the battles to come."

  khan_healthy_gang_2:0 "Potent Antidotes"
  khan_healthy_gang_2_desc:0 "There’s no shortage of critters in the wasteland dripping poison from somewhere or lack of toxic chemicals leftover from the old world. For every poison however there is an antidote, and we’ve gotten quite adept at figuring them out."

  khan_natural_stimpaks:0 "Natural Stimpaks"
  khan_natural_stimpaks_desc:0 "Stimpaks are a wonder of the old world but not one that is impossible to recreate. With the right plants and compounds we can make our own version, just as good if not better."

  khan_meds_will_be_spread:0 "Medicine Distribution"
  khan_meds_will_be_spread_desc:0 "There’s always more to learn but we’ve just about hit the limit for what we’re reasonably capable of in the field of medicine. Now all that remains is to put that learning to use. Distributing medical supplies to our people as well as our friends will make for a better future for all."

  khan_followers_spread:0 "Exchanging Knowledge"
  khan_followers_spread_desc:0 "Knowledge is the brightest light we have in these darkened days, and the Followers have more than most. They are generous friends however, sharing with us what they know. We can follow that example and pass it along to our allies as well."

  khan_followers_established_bonuses:0 "Spreading Humanitarianism"
  khan_followers_established_bonuses_desc:0 "Our patronage and protection has allowed the Followers of the Apocalypse to grow and expand freely, more than they ever could back in California or the Mojave. With that growth comes a greater influence over the people they aid, but that’s a small price to pay."

  khan_capstone_1:0 "The Khan of Khans"
  khan_capstone_1_desc:0 "The time of debate and dispute is over; the khans have spoken loud and clear in support of our new path. While today is only the beginning of what is to come, it marks an important day nonetheless. A toast!"

  khan_capstone_2:0 "An Age of Prosperity"
  khan_capstone_2_desc:0 "We’ve had a lot of hard times, no one can deny that whether they’re a khan of the north or the south. Those times might just be coming to an end now though. We’re stronger than we ever were and it’s time to enjoy it."

  khan_capstone_3:0 "Paid in Kind"
  khan_capstone_3_desc:0 "We’re the masters of this land now, and that means we get a cut of whatever action goes down in it. Call it tribute, call it taxes, actually screw taxes; call it tithes."
