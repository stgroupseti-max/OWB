KIN_geraldine_desc:0 "Everyone who's anyone knows the tragedy of little Miss Geraldine Kingsley, the "girl who wondered." Born to the merchant lords of the city, she's the last true member of the aristocracy that remains recognized across the Canadian Prairies. Though Safehaven showed her kindness, her return to Greystables is seen as an emblem of order just as much as it is an omen of how far things have fallen."
