  nf_npc.1.t:0 "Old Saint Nikolai?"
  nf_npc.1.d:0 "As the year marches on to its end, one of the most holiest times of the year is approaching here in Loid’s Ministry, that is Christmas! Comrades all around our wonderful socialist paradise have started to put their trees and await the birth of our Savior! However, rumors of an old capitalist tradition is starting to make its way around. That is the myth of Santa Claus. In response Loid has already started sending out pamphlets of the true Saint Nikolai who brought toys to good christian boys and girls of the soviet nation.\n\nStrangely, these new pamphlets have caused a stir, it seems some new people have settled from the north into our glorious nation. They are a weird bunch if the rumors are true, they have small dwarfs and talking bears? They also say there is an old jolly man wearing a red coat leading this new bunch. People are starting to connect this new jolly bunch with the pamphlet and the old capitalist myth, they seem to be merging the two.\n\nAfter weeks of this new growing sentiment, this jolly old man claims to be Comrade Nikolai. To prove his case he hands out candy canes and presents to all who sees him. It is a wonder where he gets these as there is no factory to produce such items. However, he has caught Loid’s eye. It seems our very own leader was given a personalized Bible, converting him into a believer. Everyone is wondering if the country has gone mad or if it's a Christmas miracle?"
  nf_npc.1.a:0 "He really is Saint Nikolai!"

  nf_npc.2.t:0 "Comrade Nikolai Coming to Town"
  nf_npc.2.d:0 "Overnight a very festival revolution has happened, Loid has stepped back for old Comrade Nikolai to take center stage. The jolly old marxist has already started looking for ways to increase his gift output! His magical powers can only go so far if we are to give presents to all the good little proletariat children. However, gifts are only good if these little comrades have gotten freedom by the revolution! So Comrade Nikolai is stuck at an impasse, either build factories for more toys or build factories to free the children of the wasteland. Whatever shall he do?"
  nf_npc.2.a:0 "Toys shall rise their spirits!"
  nf_npc.2.b:0 "We must free the poor little comrades!"

  nf_npc.3.t:0 "Presents Under the Tree"
  nf_npc.3.d:0 "With Christmas fast approaching Comrade Nikolai must start deciding what gifts he shall deliver to his partisans across the new Polar Soviet! As he walked through his workshop looking over all the new toys and munitions his elves were making two catches his eye. The first a standard rifle fit for any hopeful communist this revolutionary season. The other are red and white sticks of dynamite, every festive and could send those capitalist pigs running! Comrade Nikolai stands there holding the two trying to make a decision."
  nf_npc.3.a:0 "Everyone wants a rifle!"
  nf_npc.3.b:0 "But the wrapped dynamite..."

  nf_npc.4.t:0 "Nikolai’s Elves"
  nf_npc.4.d:0 "While Nikolai is checking his list for the second time he sees outside his workshop that his elves are already training for the revolution! How sweet Nikolai thinks to himself as they shoot their little rifles and take down the fake capitalist pigs! However, one elf comes in and asks Nikolai a question. Shall they use reindeer in their operations or stick to their special candy canes? One on hand the reindeers will help spread the revolution faster, but on the other these special candy canes seem to make the elves happy."
  nf_npc.4.a:0 "Let's spread the revolution faster!"
  nf_npc.4.b:0 "The candy canes! We have to bring joy after all!"

  nf_npc.5.t:0 "Ghost of Communist Present"
  nf_npc.5.d:0 "It seems the strange rumors of a mythical white bearded man with Elves is true. Today we have received a letter from this so-called Comrade Nikolai. He states that we are at the top of his Nice List? Well whatever that is, he also asks if we are willing to join his efforts in spreading his “Christmas Revolution”. It is a wonder what Christmas is, but he does seem to be a good comrade with freed workers and good working conditions."
  nf_npc.5.a:0 "Sure, let's get some milk and cookies."
  nf_npc.5.b:0 "What even is Christmas?"

  nf_npc.6.t:0 "In Hopes That Comrade Nikolai Soon Would Be There"
  nf_npc.6.d:0 "Domina accepts our gift! Comrade Nikolai was right about her, this is why she is on the top of the Nice List! Our Elves have already started heading over to their commune, putting up lights and setting up the trees. The workers have given Comrade Nikolai some amazing collectively made cookies and milk in return! Let us finish our work and get Comrade Buran in charge of the upcoming events!"
  nf_npc.6.a:0 "And a merry red Christmas to you too!"
  dominia_accepts_us:0 "Domina Accepts Us"

  nf_npc.7.t:0 "He Knows if You’ve Been Bad or Good"
  nf_npc.7.d:0 "They have decided to turn away from gifts! They have chosen to be scrooges and as such we are now forced to give them cheer by force! The worker shall now suffer for Domina’s mistake! She now will be put straight to the Naughty List! Call Comrade Buran let us get the Elves and show them the true spirit of Christmas!"
  nf_npc.7.a:0 "Not one step back!"
  dominia_rejects_us:0 "Domina Rejects Us"

  nf_npc.8.t:0 "Rudolph the Soviet Reindeer"
  nf_npc.8.d:0 "A miracle has happened recently deep within the stalls of our Reindeer farm. A Reindeer has been born with a glowing red nose! Comrade Nikolai upon hearing the nose fetched the young Reindeer. He has now become the new symbol of Christmas! Going to the collective houses and showing the kids his red nose. Telling them that the magic of Marx and Christmas allowed for such a miracle to take place!"
  nf_npc.8.a:0 "Lenin would cry at the sight!"

  nf_npc.9.t:0 "Top of the Naughty List"
  nf_npc.9.d:0 "The Great Cold War has now come to end, Senator Claus is behind bars where he belongs! His crimes of greed during such a wonderful generous season shall be put to trial in front of the workers he deceived! A new court house and gallows has been built to deal with this imposter once and for all. The gallows built by his false Elves themselves sport a special candy cane noose to make sure the imposter doesn’t escape if found guilty.\n\nThe trial took place on Christmas Eve day, when the fake Claus walked into the worker courthouse, his appearance was marked by worker revenge. His beard had been shaved and he was sporting two black eyes, the shade of the coal he deserved. It was a short trial, as this Senator Claus was unable to testify in fears of perjury! As the trial ended, he was walked towards the red and green gallows. Soon the candy cane rope cracked as the old Claus hung there swinging in the wind leaving a solemn air over all. However, soon Comrade Nikolai brought out cookies and gifts! The time for Christmas has come, let us forget this imposter!"
  nf_npc.9.a:0 "Merry Christmas!"

  nf_npc.10.t:0 "How the Comrade Stole Christmas"
  nf_npc.10.d:0 "Every wastelander down in the wasteland liked Christmas a lot, but Comrade Nikolai who lived just north of the wasteland did not!  He  saw our amazing  holiday adventure as nothing more than an abomination! Well as this Comrade spread their “Christmas” cheer across the wasteland. The real Santa Claus, Senator Claus,  was busy in the North Pole, making toys and trying to fix the FEV, third’s the charm right? As the Senator was busy slaving over his workbench an elf rushed in from the snow.\n\n“Santa! Santa! Someone is trying to impersonate you!”, exclaimed the little elf.\n\nThe old jolly  Senator Claus looked up from his toys and towards the young elf. Getting up from this bench, the Senator kneeled down to speak some holiday wisdom.\n\n“Well now Hermey, it seems we should get the sleigh ready. We have some communists that are in need of their lead poisoning.”\n\nHermey turned and rushed out to the snow towards the other reindeers, grabbing the  bells as he went. Senator Claus in turn walked back into his house into his bedroom. Opening his closet the old Senator was greeted by his red suit clean and ready for action. Grasping the old suit Senator Claus sighed and said,”it seems these communists never learn, you can’t ruin Christmas”."
  nf_npc.10.a:0 "Ho ho ho mother------!"

  nf_npc.11.t:0 "Top of the Naughty List"
  nf_npc.11.d:0 "The Great Cold War has come to end, Comrade Nikolai is behind bars where he belongs! His crimes of stealing Christmas have come to an end and he shall be put on trial for his actions! MacArthur AFB is now home to a makeshift prison for the holly jolly faker. The firing squad is readying their guns for their date with the Comrade.\n\nAs Christmas Eve approaches, Senator Claus has ordered the fake Santa to be shot before he goes and delivers his gifts across the wasteland! Comrade Nikolai even to the last second was saying how he was the real Santa, that he even has Rudolph the red nosed reindeer! However, none of the Elves listened and readied their guns as Nikolai just kept talking, then bang bang bang. There was now only one Santa, Senator Claus. After the red Santa was buried in the dirt where he belonged, Senator Claus took to the sky to spread Christmas cheer once more!"
  nf_npc.11.a:0 "Merry Christmas!"
