    nf_tlt.1.d:0 "There was a knock at the chief's door. He was busy on the other side of his room, reorganizing the contents of his cabinets. It had been getting too dusty and there was some canned fish in here so old they would've been put there by the old chief. He smiled sadly as he turned one such can over in his hand. "Yeah, come on in," he shouted. He put the can down and closed the cabinet he'd pulled it from. Lead Sheriff George entered quietly and shut the door behind him. "Ah, George! Been a minute since I've seen you around. What can I do for ya?" Callahan walked over to where George was standing next to the chief's desk. \n"Nothin' much, chief," George said. He extended his right hand and offered Callahan a letter. "Franklin sent me up to Dallas a day or two ago for a news dispatch. While I was up there, I got soloed out by some ex-Brotherhood folks and escorted to see the esteemed President of the Republic. Long story short, I'm s'possed to give you this letter. Basically, the Republic's recognized that our organization out here has got the best chance'a keepin' the peace in the region, and they want us to do our absolute best to keep that peace. Frankly, I dunno why they bothered askin' us to do what we're already doin', but they proposed a small rebranding as well. In exchange for a few changes that really ain't gonna amount to any actual change, they'll put out some good ol' fashioned propoganda reels supportin' our claim to the area." \nCallahan took the envelope."

    nf_tlt.2.d:0 "He opened it, took the letter from inside, unfolded it, and read it through twice. "Well, seems you've got a good memory for this kinda stuff. You pretty much just quoted the letter." The two had a good chuckle. "No wonder Dad always trusted you to pick 'em up on stuff he'd forget." \nGeorge grunted. "Good times. I remember bein' the old chief's mobile calendar. I miss 'em." \n"Yeah, I do too." The chief read through the letter one more time for good measure. "Well, there anythin' else, or just that?" \n"Nothin' much, chief. Though I'm headin' out to a birthday party at Larry an' Bob's place tonight, and I told 'em I'd ask you to tag along if I got the chance." Callahan looked at the old lead sheriff skeptically. "Come on, it'd make their days." \nHe smiled. "Alright, I'll be there at... when's the thing?" \n"Think it's at seven, but it's the typa family where you're expected to get there at 6:30." \n"6:15 it is. See ya then." George laughed a little more, then thanked the chief before leaving."
