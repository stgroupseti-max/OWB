  var_april_mesmeralda_gifts:0 "Mesmeraldas Gifts"
  var_april_mesmeralda_gifts_desc:0 "It seems my new Acolyte has had something to offer me as well. Her artifacts possess a great power to bend a mind to her will.

  var_april_to_the_sea_desc:0 "The west lays a great ocean, vast and unending.

  var_april_road_nevada:0 "The Barrier On The Road To Nevada"
  var_april_road_nevada_desc:0 "The gang hiding out in Chemalt Station, whatever a station is, stands in the way of me and the City of Sin. Their pitiful traditions, no matter how ancient, stand no chance in the face of my craft. Nor my Legion of the dead."

  var_april_dark_night:0 "A Dark Night Sets Upon The Station"
  var_april_dark_night_desc:0 "The gang was no match for my endless Legion, it was almost embarrassing how quickly we overran them.

  var_april_odius_king_desc:0 "The Odious King is an intriguing man. He appears to have a mastery over sound and an obsession with melodies, I can sense the psychic energy emanating from him.

  var_april_new_acolytes:0 "The Birth Of The New Acolytes"
  var_april_new_acolytes_desc:0 "It appears that the Odious King is eager to prove his worth.

  var_april_crowlands:0 "The Wicked Of The Crowlands"
  var_april_crowlands_desc:0 "My conquest of the Mirelurk Tribe has presented itself as an unexpected opportunity.

  var_april_empire:0 "The Citadel Of Our Empire"
  var_april_empire_desc:0 "Even in its ruined state, Seattle is still the greatest city I have seen in this world. Using my servants, I shall restore it to its former glory. It shall become my Citadel, a monument to both my power and my empire."

  var_april_knights:0 "The Knowledge Of The Knights"
  var_april_knights_desc:0 "I first assumed that these Knights were no different to the ones of my world, but I was mistaken. Their armour and weaponry is unlike any I have ever seen before. With their knowledge, I will be able to arm my Legion in the most advanced equipment in this world."

  var_april_man_walks:0 "Man Walks Again And Again"
  var_april_man_walks_desc:0 "The Dead of this world, shall we say, less than desirable. Whatever tragedy befell the land has weakened the people, and thus, I am forced to spend more and more time resurrecting the dead. On the bright side, my craft has improved immensely.

  var_april_tradition:0 "New Traditions?"
  var_april_tradition_desc:0 "This world is vastly different from my own, and that is most evident when it comes to weaponry. It may be wise to comprehend the nature of armaments in this world, and see if any of it can be of use to my Legion. After all, any weapon is better than none."

  var_april_circle_life_desc:0 "It seems that repeated use of my magics on my Legion has changed them.

  var_april_deep_battle:0 "Deep Battle Tactics"'
  var_april_deep_battle_desc:0 "Though my Legion is large and powerful, it does not mean that it deploys no tactics. In order to break an enemy, one must overwhelm him at every stage of the battle. Through these tactics, my Legion will be able to crush any enemy effortlessly."

  var_april_masse:0 "Levee En Masse"
  var_april_masse_desc:0 "My Legion is unstoppable, the largest army in all the wastes. No enemy can hope to withstand the endless horde that approaches them, and thus I shall send all I can at them.

  var_april_escanni:0 "Escanni Warfare Traditions"
  var_april_escanni_desc:0 "Bah, why should I bother to understand what this world considers an effective weapon. The weapons of old Castanor served my Legion well enough before, and shall do so again. I need no “firearm” when solid steel is all it takes to kill a man."

  var_april_civ:0 "Bringing Civilization Back To Where There Is None"
  var_april_civ_desc:0 "The Warren is, to be frank, a dump. The Orc population had no regard for structure or class, not understanding of civilization. Body parts hang everywhere, and these open barrels of mysterious green goo litter the place like trash. With them gone, this place can be turned into a true place of living. Perhaps, in time, it can become a new home..."

  var_april_spoils_war_desc:0 "Fortune smiles on myself. Our war with the Rib Breakers has exposed a series of weapons workshops in their land. Though I do not know exactly what a “firearm” or “Bumper Sword” is, my Legion can be equipped with them and become all the more deadlier."

  var_april_nothing_desc:0 "My land is vast, though it is not prosperous. Whatever armageddon defiled this world has left most of it barren and dead. Thankfully, I am the mistress of the dead, and through my craft, I shall breathe life back into the wasteland. All in service to me."

  var_april_new_reach:0 "The Cities New Reaches"
  var_april_new_reach_desc:0 "Though the core land of New Morgurax is developed in service to me, there is still more land available. My dead servants will build new cities, and my followers will live within and worship my name. My empire will grow, in service to me. "

I have already ordered my Legion to excavate the Creek, for the Dead do not need air or protection."

  var_april_dancers:0 "The Lands Of The Dancers"
  var_april_dancers_desc:0 "The lands that the Bone Dancers, much like the rest of this world, are dead wastelands. In parts of it, the very air itself will try to kill you. The locals call it “Rads”, some kind of magical curse I have yet to master. Alas, the dead don't seem to be affected by it, so they shall be put to work fortifying the land for future settlement."

  var_april_wicked:0 "The Dead Needs No Rest"
