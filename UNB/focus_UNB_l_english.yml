  unb_old_money_old_treasure_desc:0 "Hard as it may be to believe, Craw hasn't always been the handsome, intelligent, respectable, smart, beautiful, cunning and witty raider boss that he is now.

  unb_controlling_the_well_desc:0 "Sure, when you're busy getting in a frenzied drug high for hours every day, irrigation isn't going to be your main hobby. Water's as precious a commodity as any up north, though, and the riverline grants us an abundant supply. If we wish to establish ourselves here for the long haul, we should leverage this."
 
  unb_connecting_scobey:0 "Connecting Scobey"

  unb_culbertson_steel_desc:0 "It seems Landing's previous occupants failed to salvage much of the machine parts and building materials of the ruined homes on its east side.

  unb_the_second_mouse_gets_the_cheese_desc:0 "Moosejaw and the Rad Hazards have had a bit of a falling out. It seems like the right thing to do to step in and stop their squabbling... and the fun thing to do to steal all their shit while we're at it."

  unb_capture_new_merchandise_desc:0 "The further west we go, the more we seem to uncover all this weird consumer stuff with labels saying Middlemark.

So instead we should get some of our lads set up in our new territories. Fortifying our borders just in case the Stampede choose to try it can't hurt."

  unb_people_for_horses_desc:0 "The Great Stampede have lots of horses, animals that were apparently around before the war but have since died out. The couple ain't exactly willing to deal with us, but not everyone in the Stampede listens to the couple. A few rustlers are all we need."

  unb_welcome_the_fallen_tribe_desc:0 "Conquest is common across Canada, and through all of them soldiers will find their homes suddenly belonging to another, or no home to come back to at all. Many become raiders, and many don't get along with the Stampede. This is a winning combination, at least for us."

  unb_a_more_defensible_hideout_desc:0 "The former Fort Peck, now [1292.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], is a pretty damn good place for a proper hideout. It'll need some fortifying, but it'll give Craw and his cronies room to fly."

  unb_trust_in_sabotage:0 "Trust in Sabotage"
  unb_trust_in_sabotage_desc:0 "Computers are unreliable and untrustworthy. It's easier to simply raid some supply depots than trust a computer virus to wreak havoc, and this way our boys can have a little fun while they're at it. Those [MTC.GetAdjective] suckers won't know what hit 'em."

  unb_augmented_workforce:0 "Augmented Workforce"
  unb_augmented_workforce_desc:0 "Most of our workforce probably don't like the idea of being cyborgs very much. Most humans are scared of progress like that. But by doing it, whether they like it or no, we can improve productivity drastically, and in the end isn't that what's important?"

Of course, what they don't know is that we're simply moving them between factories. There's probably a problem here somewhere, but it's nothing a little application of force and greed won't solve."

  unb_honor_among_thieves:0 "Honour Among Thieves"
  unb_honor_among_thieves_desc:0 "The wasteland is a harsh place and trinkets are tempting, but we should look after our own. Every member of our gang is important, and every one should be valued. That way, they'll be inspired to fight all the harder."

  unb_reward_capable_craftsmen:0 "Reward Capable Craftsmen"
  unb_reward_capable_craftsmen_desc:0 "Our craftsmen don't work an exciting or glorious job, at least in the eyes of most raiders, but their work is just as vital, perhaps even more so, than that of the raiders themselves. Their weapons, armour, ammo, and other equipment are what allows a society like ours to really thrive. We need to cultivate their trust and skills."

  unb_work_towards_sustainability:0 "Work Towards Sustainability"
  unb_work_towards_sustainability_desc:0 "Taking everything we can is easily and naturally applied to most things, but in the case of agriculture it can be damaging in the long run. At least, that's what we're told. Our farmers tell us that by continuously making only the most profitable crops we damage the soil, which will lead to fewer profitable crops in the long run. Fore-sightedness is uncommon among raiders, but perhaps we should exercise it."

  unb_adopt_construction_methods:0 "Adopt Construction Methods"
  unb_adopt_construction_methods_desc:0 "It's safe to say most raiders don't know enough about construction to put together a simple shed, let alone a house that can be lived in. But we're not the only ones in this wide wasteland, and settled societies put a lot of effort into figuring out the best way to build things. It should be easy enough to copy them."

  unb_improving_their_lives:0 "Improving Their Lives"
  unb_improving_their_lives_desc:0 "It turns out that all this effort we've been making to make life easier has paid off! Our people now live (more) comfortable lives in houses that don't leak with food that, while not plentiful, is enough to stop starvation. They're happy, which actually makes things easier for us."

  unb_dig_a_new_channel:0 "Dig a New Channel"
  unb_dig_a_new_channel_desc:0 "Digging is largely unexciting work, even in the exciting and dangerous wasteland. But by digging channels and waterways across our land we'll make water more accessible, leading to better lives for our citizens and more efficient agriculture. Digging may be unexciting, but it can be important work all the same."

  unb_stolen_technology:0 "Stolen Technology"
  unb_stolen_technology_desc:0 "Raiders are, by and large, not the most innovative people on the planet - at least where non-violent things are concerned. But we should avoid falling behind technologically as we could easily find ourselves outgunned and underprepared. The solution is easy and builds on what we're good at: theft."

  unb_accept_savages_into_our_ranks:0 "Accept Savages Into our Ranks"
  unb_accept_savages_into_our_ranks_desc:0 "Tribals exist across the wasteland and many of them can be just as violent and savage as the most bloodthirsty raiders. This, of course, makes them excellent potential raiders, and it turns out their way of life does carry its advantages. Many tribals understand the wasteland in a way that others simply can't."

  unb_raiders_in_the_sky:0 "Make My Way Back Home When I Learn to Fly"
  unb_raiders_in_the_sky_desc:0 "Craw once saw the Storm Mongers in action: crazed raiders taking to the skies. Ever since, he has been obsessed with taking to the skies himself. Finally it seems we may have the building blocks to build more than just gliders: Soon, we will build proper planes, and the wasteland will fear the skies."

  unb_historian_refugees:0 "Historian Refugees"
  unb_historian_refugees_desc:0 "The Historians are an unusual group in the wasteland, obsessed with the past but not caught up in the Old World Blues the same way as the Brotherhood or the Enclave. The tragic downfall of their society has led to a mass exodus, and many come to settle in our lands. They are wise scholars and can provide us with undoubtedly useful knowledge."

  unb_a_mysterious_flower:0 "A Mysterious Flower"
  unb_a_mysterious_flower_desc:0 "While expanding our agricultural network, an unusually studious farmer discovered a flower he couldn't recognise, not just from his experience as a farmer, but from any books he had. Unfortunately, it ate him. Now, a few hundred more farmers later, we think we can control these flowers - at least, enough to guide them to our enemies."

  unb_a_society_of_warriors_and_scholars:0 "A Society of Warriors and Scholars"
  unb_a_society_of_warriors_and_scholars_desc:0 "The other nations of the wasteland may be surprised to see the transformation that has occurred within the Unbound: a surprising and growing appreciation for knowledge and the value of the citizen. Of course, it is still a violent and martial society, but one in which both scientists and soldiers can coexist."
