She annoyed me so I killed her, but now I've been thinking about that a lot. What the fuck am I gonna amount to? A nameless deserter who joined up with a raider gang? Fuck that shit. I have dreams, aspirations, and all that. These boys who I joined up with understand me. We get each other. I was wasting my time as a soldier, fighting for a shit cause I didn't give a fuck about. Here, with these boys, we do whatever the fuck we want. Living life to the edge. As a matter of fact, we have plans to ditch this Manitoba joint entirely– the boss has plans. Keeps saying we'll head out to some shitheap named Missoula out west, rife with caps and weak as hell. We'll knock their shit out can't fucking wait, and then no son of a bitch can call me a deserter or coward. Especially if I'm at the top! I wonder what kinda shit I might learn from this though, maybe..?"

  nf_unb.2.d:0 "Beauty, I... have witnessed true beauty, glory, awe, the most amazing gift from a god I am unsure of's existence. True power has been shown to me, the true genius of ingenuity that could grant my ascension to something greater, something more powerful than I could have hoped for: The skies and the power that is held over the battlefield that lies in them. \n\nThrough my gang's destruction at the hands of the Storm Mongers, I think that's their name– at least that's what the local screamed as they tore him apart, I had a revelation of this very destiny I will take upon. I will ascend to the skies, and I will wreak terror upon those that I wish to from them. \n\nI'm heading back to Manitoba, this gang's good as gone and I'm tired of playing grunt. There are some good old-heads I know that'd jump at the chance to join a new gang anyway– firstly I'll teach them of the Storm Mongers..."

  nf_unb.3.d:0 "So, Journal, I've been home for a good bit now. Got some of the older raiders from when everyone was all about this biz'; some of them were even a part of the big gangs! Course most of the kids of the dead ones wanted to come along too so now we've got a big ol' happy raider family- a tribe even! I don't even wanna kill them when they do mean shit to me neither! Cuz they know I'm in charge! \n\nUp until recently we had a good thing going too. We found some fellas calling themselves revolutionaries in [UNB.Capital.GetName] and knocked some heads thinking this would be a great base for us; found a buncha uniforms and figured it was time we went professional. But then the people of the area starting bringing us stuff! Guess that means we've been hired as mercenaries for the Kingdom!\n\nThat is until the revolutionaries we were hired to fight came and started messing with us; what a pain in the ass. \n\nSo far we've been using the people that we turned into our gang for..."

I'll never tell them this, but it almost brings a tear to my eye. Which is why today is a bit hard for me. Marro's retiring. Funny idea, ain't it? A raider retiring. He's got a good head on his shoulders, and we can all attest to him saving us at least once. Tomorrow, he's gone. But until then we're gonna throw him the best damn party this side of the north. It's the least he deserves."

Bodies of both parties had been devoured with little care to the sanctity of the dead, a telltale sign of feral ghouls. The ghouls have always tended to keep to themselves, something to do with the cold, but if this battle is anything to go by that's changing. The settlers will have to do their best to drive them off and keep them from their borders, through force if necessary."

A good reward for those that could see that I was destined for great shit, an even better one for those that stayed loyal. \n\nTurns out though I don't REALLY have to do much anyway! I re-wired Penny to be a loyal manager to me and only me; so far she's been doing it so well I don't even really have to think about it! \n\nAs of now, I'm giving my boys the ability to raid whatever, whoever, and whenever. What that means, I'm not sure! But as long as they stay loyal, don't fuck my shit up, and I get to keep on making bots, I don't care!

A weathered man in aged armor, claiming to represent the Unbound, a southern raider clan, attempted to force his way into the palace grounds. The guards, understandably, were quick to dismiss him. However, his mention of being from the Unbound caught the attention of onlooking royal advisers.\n\nGiven the rising tensions between the Kingdom and its former territories, news of a potential war was on everyone's mind. The man's proposal, inspired by Gunn I's historic diplomatic success with the warlords of Manitoba, suggested that the Unbound could be convinced to join forces with Manitoba against the Métis and the Republic of Three Rivers.\n\nThis proposal sparked a heated debate within the King's court. While some vehemently opposed the idea, arguing that aligning with raiders would tarnish Manitoba's reputation, others saw it as a strategic opportunity to gain powerful allies in the upcoming conflict."
