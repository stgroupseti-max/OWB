  ###Industry Branches
  ghoul_industry_starter:0 "Crawl Out Through the Fallout, Baby"
  ghoul_industry_starter_desc:0 "§g"... to my loving arms, through the rain of Strontium-90."§!\nAfter the destruction of our nation, highly radiated areas become familiar sights - and even a toddler can tell you that they're no-gone zones. Except, of course, if you're a ghoul and highly resistant to radiation - and as we need more space to expand our settlement, it is only logical to remove the rubble from these unreachable places."
  ghoul_industry_infrastructure:0 "Key to the Highway"
  ghoul_industry_infrastructure_desc:0 "§g"I've got the key to the highway, Billed out and bound to go."§!\nNow that we cleaned part of our city, we should connect them to our road network. Not only are people, but shops and facilities both will move to this new parcel, and moving anything in that direction will need fewer roadblocks."
  #Left-Side (Construction)
  ghoul_industry_construction:0 "There'll Be Some Changes Made"
  ghoul_industry_construction_desc:0 "§g"For there's a change in the weather, There's a change in the sea."§!\nAnd there will be a change in our attitude towards construction. While we made good progress moving into pre-war houses and fixin' them to a standard, we're running out of those. We'll build our homes for the future generation and not borrow them from the past one."
  ghoul_industry_construction_tools:0 "Scratchin' In the Gravel"
  ghoul_industry_construction_tools_desc:0 "§g"..."§!\nThere are simple, beautiful things in this world that do not require further elaboration from anyone. That's just as true for Mary Lou Williams' old record or for the fact that people need jobs to sustain themselves. We'll make tools to speed up our development, and our first factory will make them."
  ghoul_industry_construction_civilian_workshops:0 "Don't Fence Me In"
  ghoul_industry_construction_civilian_workshops_desc:0 "§g"Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above, Don't fence me in."§!\nThe wish for unrestricted freedom is one we understand to our very core. Yet, we cannot grant it to everyone, as our workshops demand more workers. Work turns one noble, after all."
  ghoul_industry_construction_homes:0 "Come On-A My House"
  ghoul_industry_construction_homes_desc:0 "§g"Come on-a my house, my house, I'm gonna give you everything."§!\nPeople will need built homes to live in, and while we're in the business to make them, we could make them better. While re-learning building techniques or the proper way of utilizing our material is challenging, it is one we should tackle."
  ghoul_industry_construction_manpower_saving:0 "Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens"
  ghoul_industry_construction_manpower_saving_desc:0 "§g"There ain't nobody here but us chickens, There ain't nobody here at all."§!\nWhile our people do not hide in chicken coops to avoid a draft, there are still fields where manpower is wasted. The odd robot, the too old or too young, or simply somebody who does not fit to serve can do jobs back at home. The chickens will be put to work."
  ghoul_industry_construction_arms_workshop:0 "Nine Pound Hammer"
  ghoul_industry_construction_arms_workshop_desc:0 "§g"Oh, roll on, buddy, don't you roll so slow, How can I roll when the wheels won't go?"§!\nThings are heavy, and they will not get any easier if we stop trying. Not a very hopeful song, for sure, but it fits the mine where it got singed. We cannot roll over on either without the proper way of defending ourselves and as such, one more workshop will be opened."
  ghoul_industry_construction_arms_factories:0 "Sixteen Tons"
  ghoul_industry_construction_arms_factories_desc:0 ""§gYou load sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt."§!\nLabouring without an end, without reward and purpose - that's life in a coal mine, but not in our workshops. The armsies give plentiful rest and the payment is good enough to sustain yourself and slowly, but surely rack up some savings as well."
  ghoul_industry_construction_weapon_restoration:0 "Pistol Packin' Mama"
  ghoul_industry_construction_weapon_restoration_desc:0 "§g"Lay that pistol down babe, lay that pistol down."§!\nWhile the further immediate expansion will have to wait for a while, we can make our current production yield more fruit. While we don't threaten by an angry mother-in-law, laying down the gun and examining will help us tremendously."
  ghoul_industry_construction_factory_capstone:0 "I Can't Be Satisfied"
  ghoul_industry_construction_factory_capstone_desc:0 "§g"Well babe I can't never be satisfied, And I just can't keep from crying."§!\nWhile the record implies losing everything because one cannot be satisfied, that's a problem we cannot have facing. How could hurt us to want more places to work, and to expand our industry?"

  ###Ideas
  ghoul_idea_energy:0 "Dead Energy"
