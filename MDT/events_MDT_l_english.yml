  nf_mdt.1.t:0 "Life as a Viper"
  nf_mdt.1.d:0 "The memories are clouded now, but I know this much: I was once a Viper. One of them. A raider, a rider, a daughter of cruelty. We struck hard and rode faster, leaving ash in our wake.\nNow, I don't see them as my people, not really—but they gave me purpose when I had none. I wore their colors, followed their laws. I even laughed like them.\nWhat I don't remember is the name I used to wear. It's gone, stripped from me.\nBut before that? I had a home. I had a name. I had a story. I remember one thing clearly—a comic book tucked beside my cot.\n§RGrognak the Barbarian.§! I used to read it before sleep, whispering the lines like a prayer.\n\nWhat did I carry from that life into the one that came after?"
  nf_mdt.1.a:0 "Never give in."
  nf_mdt.1.b:0 "Only the strong endure."
  nf_mdt.1.c:0 "Trust no one, not fully."
  nf_mdt.2.t:0 "The Void"
  nf_mdt.2.d:0 "We rode north for a job—tools, salvage, captives. I didn't ask questions. I was a Viper.\nBut I was not the only one with plans.\nSomeone back home wanted me gone. They whispered into ears, slipped coin into hands. When the time came, the Vipers turned on me.\nThey didn't kill me. That would've been too kind.\nThey used the tools we brought north—the pliers, the irons, the chains. They used them on me. Not to end me, but to erase me. Strip away my name. My face. My past.  \nThey left me in the wreckage of a shattered palanquin, barely breathing.  \nI reached for something—anything—and found it.\n§RGrognak the Barbarian: In Battle with the Queen of the Gorgons.§!\nI opened it with bloodied fingers. And there she was.\n§RMesmeralda.§! A queen. A weapon. A story I could wear like armor. Noone would know of my scars but me..."
  nf_mdt.2.a:0 "Scars on the face."
  nf_mdt.2.b:0 "Scars on the body."
  nf_mdt.2.c:0 "Scars on the soul."
  nf_mdt.3.t:0 "The Truth"
  nf_mdt.3.d:0 "I left the north with nothing but the tools they used to break me—and the name I took from that comic. Not my old name. Not theirs. Mine.\n§RMesmeralda.§!\nI came upon the Marrow Drinkers. A cruel tribe, proud and armored. They thought me a stray. A victim.\nThey were wrong.\nWith fire and fury, I shattered their champions. With every blow, I told them a story—of Grognak, of the Queen of the Gorgons, of a name born from ashes and betrayal. I showed them what I had become.\nWhen it was over, they didn't mock me. They listened.\nI spoke of §RHubris§!, not just the publisher, but the power. The idea. The truth.\nAnd when they asked what I sought, I told them:\nNot pity. Not peace.\nTribute."
  nf_mdt.3.a:0 "They brought me tools of iron and fire."
  nf_mdt.3.b:0 "They offered me their stories and their secrets."
  nf_mdt.3.c:0 "They gave me warriors to command."
  nf_mdt.4.t:0 "A Dark Offer?"
  nf_mdt.4.d:0 "[MDT.GetName] are giving us a offer - they say that they are willing to help us clear out the super mutants to the south if we agree to submitting to them. While submission doesn't sound too good at the least we will be able to ensure that the Warren aren't able to conquer us if we listen to them."
  nf_mdt.4.a:0 "The Warren are our biggest concern, lets accept their offer."
  nf_mdt.4.b:0 "Submission is never a option! Lets fight on our own."
  nf_mdt.5.t:0 "They refuse!"
  nf_mdt.5.d:0 "It seems the Rib Breakers have a death warrant."
  nf_mdt.5.a:0 "Fine! I will conquer them anyway."
  nf_mdt.6.t:0 "They accept!"
  nf_mdt.6.d:0 "It looks like they aren't as dumb as they look, together we can put these Trolls under our heel properly."
  nf_mdt.6.a:0 "Great! Let us wipe out the Trolls together!"
  nf_mdt.7.t:0 "A Pact Perpetual?"
  nf_mdt.7.d:0 "Recently we have been approached again by the [MDT.GetAdjective], they seemed... more aggressive this time. Their \"Envoy\" speaking of our land as if it belonged directly to them. Now that we don't have to worry about the Trolls we don't have to listen to them, right?\n\nIf we accept this, it will likely mean our forced annexation in the near future."
  nf_mdt.7.a:0 "We can never accept this!"
  nf_mdt.7.b:0 "It looks like we have no choice..."
  nf_mdt.8.t:0 "The [RBT.GetName] have revolted!"
  nf_mdt.8.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] have betrayed us! They believe they are independent and that our deal was supposed to only be temporary!"
  nf_mdt.8.a:0 "I can't believe this!"
  nf_mdt.9.t:0 "They submit to us!"
  nf_mdt.9.d:0 "Soon their realm will be formally a part of mine, The [FROM.GetAdjective] not seeming as eager as they once seemed to try for independence."
  nf_mdt.9.a:0 "Good.."
  nf_mdt.10.t:0 "Heavy, the Oaken Crown"
  nf_mdt.10.d:0 "It began with scars. With betrayal. With a story pulled from the wreckage of a palanquin.\n\nNow, that story has become law.\n\nAcross Oregon, they no longer see me as I was—as the girl without a name, as the slave left to rot, as the weapon made of salvage. No. They kneel because they know the truth:\nI am §RMesmeralda§!, Queen of Gorgons, First of the Serpent Line, Sovereign of Hubris.\n\nThe world they thought was real—the mapmakers’ borders, the scavenger clans, the rusted laws of old men—all of that was illusion. I have rewritten it. Not with ink, but with belief.\n\nNow, the vassals gather. Not as peers, but as witnesses. To see the coronation not of a warlord, but of a myth made manifest.\nThis crown is not gold. It is petrified oak. Grown from ruin. Rooted in vengeance.\nAnd heavy with meaning."
  nf_mdt.10.a:0 "Let them watch fiction become truth."
