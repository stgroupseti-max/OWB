  grd_wg_on_des: "MISSION; Coming-Storm"
  grd_wg_on_des_desc: "§YCALLSIGN:§! §RRHIANNON§!\n§YMISSION REPORT:§! §gWake up, Cardinal. I need you once again.\nA storm's brewing over Esmeralda, I need you to blow it away. Find the source.§!"
  grd_wg_on_south: "MISSION; White-Red"
  grd_wg_on_south_desc: "§YCALLSIGN:§! §RMANAWYDDAN§!\n§YMISSION REPORT:§! §gHow could things have gotten this bad?! Is something drawing these people here? These weren't a part of the plan! Fix this!§!"

  grd_unique_desc: "§YCALLSIGN:§! §RPRYDERI§!\n§YMISSION REPORT:§! §gYour pascalbytes have proven themselves just to accomplish a victory like this. Seek out the World Hole and await our return.§!"
  grd_advanced_recruitment_strategies: "\"Advanced Recruitment Strategies\""
  grd_advanced_recruitment_strategies_desc: "Ultimately, the Guardians have only flourished as an offshoot of Lost Hills for so long as a result of our recruitment strategies. Ultimately we need to reach out to other groups in the wasteland if we wish to expand our number.\nThere were some raiders up to the north, they could use some with education!"
  grd_vip_wg: "\"Recruiting\" the Vipers"
  grd_vip_wg_desc: "The Vipers might seem a strange group to reach out to to train their young into Guardians, what with their strange cultist ways. Nothing a bit of elbow grease can’t fix! The grease being painful discipline, and the elbows being them, of course."
  grd_ykz_wg: "\"Recruiting\" the Yakuza"
  grd_ykz_wg_desc: "The Yakuza, when they are beaten and working under us, will do well to serve as new recruits. Their strange language will serve as a signalling tool so that, as scouts, they can communicate without the risk of others hearing in."
  grd_jac_wg: "\"Recruiting\" the Jackals"
  grd_jac_wg_desc: "The bloodthirsty jackals may have a strange appetite for.. human flesh, but if anything is true it's the fact that a man with a vice can be controlled like any dog. Their craving will be used as a leash by which we may break, then reforge them into the Guardians they were always meant to be."
  grd_neighbors_beaten: "Initiation Ritual"
  grd_neighbors_beaten_desc: "By candle, sword and battery we have beaten our foes. Soon they shall learn the proper Guardian way!"
  grd_acquiring_the_old_worlds_bones: "Potential Initiates Among Us"
  grd_acquiring_the_old_worlds_bones_desc: "It is not only by reaching out must we expand our ranks, but through domination of those living in our lands too! There are some remnants here that hold true to the old ideals of the groups we have slayed. Let us reach out to these men so that they may become Guardians!"
  grd_sok_deep_integration: "Rethinking Their God"
  grd_sok_deep_integration_desc: "'Kaga', as he was known, was practically a god to the Sons. If we ever hope to reach out to these tribals we will need to strip them of this false mysticism, bring out the good in them yet so that they might turn their lives around and work for something grander."
  grd_tof_deep_integration: "Working With Raiders"
  grd_tof_deep_integration_desc: "The 215th, once a group of prisoners from the town of Jericho, could prove pivotal to our furthering as an institution! A raider is a weak-willed creature, and by offering them safety and an outlet for their rage might we (yet) convert them to a higher calling."
  grd_des_deep_integration: "A Failed Idea"
  grd_des_deep_integration_desc: "The Rogue Rangers, it seems, thought themselves truly righteous in this world. A group that felt that the innocent, no matter what, should be protected.\nIf we wish to get them on our side we merely should show that we stand for the ideals of protecting the old world better than they do!"
  grd_tvt_deep_integration: "Secrets of the Androids"
  grd_tvt_deep_integration_desc: "The Androids of TV-Town, it seems, were not the enthralled slave army we have thought. They had free will, yet were merely scared into compliance on the orders of some strange higher power. While a majority of the Androids were decimated in our attack we have managed to hack into the machine-brains of a few of these automatons, accessing databanks that could prove vital to rebuilding the wasteland."
  grd_repairing_guardian_citadel: "Citadel Repairs"
  grd_repairing_guardian_citadel_desc: "The Citadel took some damage in our fight against NCR forces. Let's see if we can make some repairs here!"
  grd_outer_sanctum: "Outer Sanctum"
  grd_outer_sanctum_desc: "The outer sanctum walls could use some new furnishing! The hardened ceramic skin of the androids we fought at TV-Town should make for a durable outer layer!"
  grd_armory_and_workshop: "Armoury and Workshop Quarters"
  grd_armory_and_workshop_desc: "The Citadel has always functioned off of the back of those willing to fight and work for its safety. Among the Guardians it is the workshop where the weapons we use to strike down wastelanders are made, and the armoury where the hardened T-51c is embossed with our grand sigil."
  grd_tangs_lab: "Tang's Lab"
  grd_tangs_lab_desc: "Tang, a volunteer scientist who came to the Citadel for a cooperation mission, has agreed to lend us some of his secrets!"
  grd_repairs_finished: "Welcoming Traders"
  grd_repairs_finished_desc: "Recently, wastelanders have started to see our great Citadel stand tall among the fern and wilds of Esmeralda. Let’s invite them to trade their goods here, if they have anything we find of interest, of course."
  grd_guardians_of_the_world_hole: "Guardians of the World Hole"
  grd_guardians_of_the_world_hole_desc: "It is here, over two hundred years ago and past the Glow, that the Brotherhood's true founders braved the flames of the great war unscathed. The unburnt souls of the §RTROIKA§! are all that remains pure and untouched from the old world, thanks to this - the world hole. I can think of no greater mission then to guard this holy place, preserve it so that we can leave this world when the fires come again."
  grd_guardians_of_the_world_hole_tt: "§gWe commune with the Cauldron of Rebirth located within the world hole. Through it, we are given gifts from outside the world.§!"
  grd_tactical_lessons:0 "Tactical Innovations"
  grd_tactical_lessons_desc:0 "Wastelanders don't always make for the greatest recruits, but the new initiates sourced from our campaigns in Nevada bring with them great experience in the warfare of today. Investigating this, studying their successes or failures and applying what we learn to our more traditional tactics will give us the knowledge to handle a far wider bredth of scenarios in combat."
  grd_rush_of_laser:0 "Refined Crystal Arrays"
  grd_rush_of_laser_desc:0 "The microfusion cell is a powerful source of energy, but it takes more than that for laser rifles to pack a punch. The lack of moving parts makes them a superior choice for our needs, suffering less from extensive use than traditional firearms, but the delicate crystals housed within the weapon require cleaning and servicing to remain potent. Fortunately, we're experts in such matters."
  grd_power_armor_restoration:0 "Mechanic Training"
  grd_power_armor_restoration_desc:0 "When setting off from Lost Hills, we brought with us the best equipment available. Since then, many of our prized T-51b suits have suffered damage and been left inoperable. Obviously, our adversaries here were not experts on such technology, but every large scale conflict requires the backing of men and women who fix or manufacture the equipment it is fought with. With time, we could undoubtedly train many skilled engineers from these populations."
  grd_domestic_production:0 "Domestic Production"
  grd_domestic_production_desc:0 "It's simply not practical to insist that every gun we put in the hands of our soldiers needs to be our own. This is especially true now that weapons are our primary good for trade. Producing materials with both civilian and military applications will secure our place in a changing market and allow us to barter for weapons in quantities that'd be far more costly to produce ourselves."
  grd_economic_boom:0 "Flow of Goods"
  grd_economic_boom_desc:0 "We aren't exactly known for being the most outgoing group in the wasteland, but what stops us from making a change? The influx of wastelanders has given the Citadel a civilian population substantial enough to grow our home into a respectable economic hub in its own right. We would be foolish to turn such a prospect down."
  grd_grand_hallway_library:0 "The Grand Hallway Library"
  grd_grand_hallway_library_desc:0 "One of many facilities in the Outer Sanctum is a library of pre-war books overseen by our scribes. Among many fiction works lies an archive of a variety of manuals, with subjects including weaponry, electronics, machinery and even handling explosives. These books are delicate to the touch, but committing more resources to transcribing their contents would let us access more of the knowledge they hold."
