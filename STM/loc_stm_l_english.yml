  STM_baptism:0 "Baptized in Blood"
  STM_baptism_desc:0 "The blood of lying sheep stains our weapons; the wind still ripe with the screams of the guilty. Judgment came from on high, and so we have cast it down like a hammer.

Though we are all equal in the eyes of the lord, we need not be among men."
  STM_mighty_warriors:0 "The Sky's Soldiers"
  STM_mighty_warriors_desc:0 "To walk in the clouds, to fly so close to the sun-- is there no way to be more godly?

  STM_stations_of_the_sky:0 "Stations of the Sky"
  STM_stations_of_the_sky_desc:0 "Those who came before gathered in churches, and spoke in hushed prayers. Our age is different; we are men and women of action. Our churches are the stations of the sky, where destiny is forged by fuel and made concrete by bombs from on high."

  STM_servants_of_servants_desc:0 "Are we not all slaves in the eyes of God? Are we not all servants to his whimsy? We should all be so fortunate, truly, to have such destined purpose. The duty of our slaves remains the same as our own: to fulfill our quest as they were made to."
  STM_caps_add:0 "Manna From Heaven"
  STM_caps_add_desc:0 ""A miracle of God," the men called, "a modern day miracle." Tens of thousands of caps, all found within a day.

  STM_area_of_weather:0 "An Area of Weather"
  STM_area_of_weather_desc:0 "If God had wanted us to be free of the burdens of flight, then he would not have allowed man to craft the plane.

  STM_north_wind:0 "Negafook"
  STM_north_wind_desc:0 "Pilgrims from afar, from within and without, speak of the mighty blizzards to the north: a place home to only Inuit and old world ghosts.

  STM_read_he_bones:0 "Oracle Bone Scripts"
  STM_read_he_bones_desc:0 "The Oracles, the Priests, read the cryptic declarations of the LORD from the bones of the fallen, just as any babe would from a book of yore. Where GOD cannot speak, we turn to them for guidance-- for dead men tell more tales than any other."

  STM_lightning_carriers:0 "Lightning Carriers"
  STM_lightning_carriers_desc:0 "GOD entrusted man with the power of the Heavens in the form of energy weapons; the children of pre-war modern warfare, capable of firing a multitude of ichorous, heated substances that would turn the mind and body to jelly.

  STM_divine_assistance:0 "Divine Assistance"
  STM_divine_assistance_desc:0 "In a just, godly society, there can be no doctors; did a PhD give you the talents you hold? Did a PhD teach you how to save a man? No. It was the hand of GOD that graced your mind, that allowed you to have the gift to spare the dying. Would God willingly let us stay our ascension to Heaven? No! And so we shall only allow the gifted to act as healers, for GOD would ask no better of us."

  STM_wind_carries_us_west_desc:0 "GOD knew of our deeds, and so he gives unto us a new mission, a new direction. The heavens opened the day after the last Enclave soldier had fallen, and the light of the LORD pointed west. \n\nSo it was decided, then and there, that west we shall go."

  nf_storm.1.d:0 "God punished our people for the sins of mankind, for the inequity and vices of our forefathers.

For did not the prophet turn his face from this fallen world? Did he not ascend from HELL to the garden above? Did he not know that the smell of blood is sweet, and the screams of the dying are like sweet music to the Divine? \n\nAnd so, let us gather the fruits of the flesh, and with our labor create a heavenly chorus that GOD cannot deny! Only then, will we be worthy of sun and rain, of green fields, and a bountiful harvest!"

Therefore, if you obey my voice, and keep my covenant, you shall be a teasure above all people. You will be a kingdom of pilots and a holy nation.' \n\nAnd the Storm Mongers ascended into heaven; and ate of the unleavened bread, and set up the tabernacle in  the traffic control tower. And they set before the altar the burnt offering, and a cloud covered the airport. The glory of GOD filled the airbase, and its RADAR guided the people by day and by night, in all the house of the Storm Mongers, throughout all their journeys."

  nf_storm.4.d:0 "And it came to us as of the words of angels on high: “Render unto the lord of lords the wealth of heathen, heretic and sinner, that your righteousness may be tested and proven.” True believers are not folk who prove idle in the face of divine direction and so with haste we moved to obey. To the heathen north and the heretic south marched and soared the servants of the lord.\n\nA rain of fire from roaring skies as of revelation was brought to the unbelievers of Havre, that they may taste the punishment their sin will purchase them in death. To the counters of coin and false believers of the Eyrie went true believers to take of their herd for sacrifice and righteous purpose. Upon the return of all to our holy home there was great rejoicing and a time of decision making. The flock needed:"
