  oro_mutagens:0 "A New Outlook"
  oro_mutagens_desc:0 "Hecate figured that ultimately, her experiments in her lab were merely the result of a flawed outlook:\nShe relied too much on the wisdom of ancients.

  oro_tonics_2_desc:0 "Far to the west, in the fabled lands where the Chosen One lives, a temple existed.

  oro_tonics_3:0 "Adrian Beyr's Wisdom"

  oro_industry:0 "Proto-Feudalism"
  oro_industry_desc:0 "Ouroboros's industry has taken shape as a structured hierarchy, almost resembling a form of proto-feudalism. Daughters of Hecate govern the farmland, granting workers rights to till the soil, giving them a share of their yield.

  oro_well_rounded_industry:0 "Serfdom in the Umbral Age"
  oro_well_rounded_industry_desc:0 "Beneath the watchful gaze of the Dark Mother, Ouroboros molds its destiny in work and faith. Adrian Beyr and the Daughters of Hecate weave a grand vision, where industry does not merely serve, but sanctifies, forging a civilization where duty and devotion are one. Towering manufactories rise like obsidian spires, their furnaces breathing life into machines of war and wonder alike."
  oro_well_rounded_industry_tt:0 "§gAdrian Beyr, ever the scholar, has set forth an ambitious vision for Ouroboros-one drawn from both 'ancient Rome' and the gilded tycoons of the Old World. He proposes that its industrial centers function as autonomous 'tribes,' each a self-sustaining fief bound in fealty to the central authority of the Dark Pyramid. He refers to it as 'Neo-Manorialist Feudalism', much like Mark Antony's vision for Rome's eastern provinces before 'the Latin Caesar stopped him'. This fusion of feudal governance and industrial might, Beyr argues, could create a culture resilient enough to endure beyond mere conquest. A culture where reverence and diligence are one—Ouroboros serving as the cradle for a new world.§!"

  oro_pyramid_of_the_dark_moon_desc:0 "The Pyramid of the Dark Moon was the cornerstone of Ouroboros, envisioned by Hecate in a dream.

  oro_infrastructure_effort_desc:0 "Dr. Adrian Beyr, once a Follower of the Apocalypse, found himself imprisoned for his heretical views.

  oro_fortification_effort:0 "Old Umbral Hill"
  oro_fortification_effort_desc:0 "The Old Umbral Hill is the sacred site where Hecate envisioned the Dark Pyramid in her dreams. This hill, in time, became the foundation for Ouroboros.

  nf_oro_history.1.d:0 "The Legion came like a flood, and the Twisted Hairs were swept away. For the Legion, it was another victory; for her, it was the end of everything. Her people were gone, her home turned to ash. The few that survived vanished into the ranks of their conquerors. But not her.\n\nShe ran.\n\nThe heat swallowed her, pressed against her skin like a brand. The sun carved into her shoulders, flayed her lips, boiled her blood. The tribes she sought for shelter did the same. Their words scalded, their gazes burned. They called her cursed. A death maiden. The Dark Mother. The mark of the Legion was upon her, and to harbor her was to invite ruin. And so, they cast her out.\n\nTheir rejection was fire. The desert was fire. The hate inside her was fire.\n\nIt burned away her memories. Her father's voice, her mother's hands, the scent of her people's cookfires—charred to dust, lost to the wind. She tried to hold on, but the fire consumed them all. The Twisted Hairs, her tribe, her family. The flames ate everything until only one thing remained.\n\nHatred.\n\nThe Legion had taken everything. The tribes had abandoned her. She would show them all.\n\nShe wandered until her body failed her, until she could walk no further. She collapsed beneath the burning sky, swallowed by the desert."

The world blurred, her vision slipping between reality and dream. \n\nThen, she saw it.\n\nA figure loomed above her, wreathed in shadow, its form shifting like smoke caught in the wind. It held a great tome in its hands, the pages blackened, curling at the edges as if burned by time itself. Slowly, it opened the book and, in a voice as hollow as the graves of her people, began to read.\n\n§R"The darkness of the afterlife is all that awaits you now. May you find more peace in that world than you found in this one."§!\n\nThe specter closed the tome. Its voice carried no malice, no mercy—only inevitability. It reached out, fingers stretching toward her, seeking to pull her into the depths beyond life. To reunite her with her tribe. To end what little remained of her story.\n\nThen—another hand.\n\nCold. Solid. Mechanical.\n\nIt gripped her arm, firm and unyielding, wrenching her from the specter's grasp. A force unseen dragged her from the brink, pulling her away, toward something else. A new fate. A new path.\n\nShe gasped, breath returning in ragged bursts, her body lurching back into the waking world. The wasteland still burned around her, the sun still hung above, and yet—\n\nShe turned her head. The specter remained where it was, unmoving. Watching. It did not follow. It did not fight.\n\nIt had her face.\n\nHer own eyes stared back at her from the void, empty and knowing.\n\nShe had chosen.\n\nShe did not belong to Death anymore."

Slowly, she turned.\nA woman stood before her. No—not a woman, something greater.\nShe was radiant, towering over her like a goddess of old, draped in flowing light. Her face shimmered, indistinct, shifting like moonlight on water. Warmth radiated from her presence, and when she spoke, her voice resonated like a song carried on the wind.\n\n§B"I see that you are awake."§! The words were gentle, but they filled the world. §B"I am Diana. Can you tell me your name?"§!\nShe searched the void of her memory. There was nothing. No tribe, no home, no past. Just echoes.

Do you mind?"§!\n\n"Hecate..." she echoed, the name alien yet familiar.\n\n§B"Yes. You see, I am Diana, named for the bright moon. Hecate was her opposite, the dark moon. The Dark Mother."§!\nA goddess of the bright moon. A goddess of the dark.\nThe name settled in her mind, burrowing deep. §BSpoken by a god, it must be true.§!

Around her stood the Daughters, robed in deep indigo, their faces painted in sacred patterns. They had pulled her here, dragging the palanquin across the dust and rock as they had done since the day they proclaimed her divine.\n\nBefore them, figures emerged—gaunt, sun-scorched, hardened by the wastes. Jordan Dae and his followers.\n\nDae had walked across fire and ruin to reach this place. To reach her. The moment he laid eyes upon her, he fell to his knees.\n\nThere was recognition in his eyes. The awe of a man who had already seen her, not in flesh, but in prophecy.\n\n"I have dreamed of you," he murmured.\n\nHecate tilted her head, watching him.

Braziers flickered, their glow casting shifting patterns along the floor.\nDr. Adrian Beyr, a scholar of the Followers of the Apocalypse, stood before the throne of Hecate. His hands were free, his posture measured but eager. He had come to offer what he could—his knowledge, his findings, his mind.\n\n"I am just so amazed at what I see here! The lavish interior, the decorum and health of your people—you even understand the importance of hygiene! Never have I seen a tribe this advanced before in my life.\nAnd your appreciation for history too! The way you reference the ancient Greek pantheon as you do—" He smiled, gesturing with his hands. "You know, with the name Hecate."\nThe air grew thick. The chamber, once grand and imposing, felt as though it had shrunk around her.\n\nHecate's breath caught.\n\nA sharp, sudden pain clenched in her chest, her fingers gripping the armrest of her throne. The flickering braziers seemed too bright, their shifting light warping, pressing against the walls. The room was too warm. The voices around her too loud.\nThe blood in her ears roared like an oncoming storm.\nShe was mortal.\nThe Daughters around her tensed, sensing something was wrong. One reached for her, hesitated, then turned sharply toward Beyr. Their goddess had faltered—this man had done something. He had said something.\nPanic spread like wildfire.\n"Take him!" one of the Daughters shouted.\nBeyr barely had time to react before hands seized him, yanking him back. He did not resist. His expression was not fear, but confusion—his words had been praise. What had he said? What had he done?\nHecate exhaled, shallow and ragged, forcing her vision back into focus. The storm in her chest had not yet passed, but her voice remained steady.\n"Yes. Take him to the lower chambers," she commanded. "He will have time to reflect on his words.""

From the towering walls to the hidden sanctums, everything was as she had envisioned.\n\nAdrian's synthetic obsidian now coated the pyramid's surface, drinking in the moonlight. The city pulsed with quiet industry, its people moving with purpose. They worshiped her. Feared her. Loved her.\n\nHecate had built this.

A whisper in the back of her mind.\n\nShe lowered her gaze.\n\nHer hands—once steady, once unyielding—now bore the weight of years.

Accustomed to texts filled with cryptic strategies and veiled instructions, she found this one's straightforward wisdom almost riddle-like.\n\nUnsure how to proceed, Hecate called upon Jordan Dae for advice. Dae was taken aback. How could someone so perfect struggle with a book this simple? So human? 'Ruminating to Riches' emphasized the value of small, good deeds and the happiness they brought, a stark contrast to the grandiose plans of conquest and power Hecate was used to.\n\nTogether, they began a book club of sorts, meeting regularly to dissect and discuss the lessons the book preached."

Despite their regular studies and discussions, she realized why the book eluded her understanding: she did not know happiness.\n\nHer memories of a time before the Legion's destruction of her tribe were like shards of broken glass, fragmented and painful to touch. The pieces of her past before meeting Diana were indistinct, obscured by a haze of sorrow and rage. Her hatred for the Legion burned with a consuming fire, a relentless force that had shaped her every action and desire. Vengeance had been her only guiding star.\n\nJordan Dae had observed this, noting how Hecate seemed incapable of appreciating the worth of her accomplishments. Risking the wrath of his goddess, he offered a simple, bold suggestion.\n\n'What if you were to simply relax, here in your city? Breathe the air and enjoy the fruits of your labor. See what your people have built for you with your own eyes. Maybe that will bring you some peace.'"

She needed to eclipse them, to transcend beyond what they had done to her. Washing off her traditional makeup for the day, she walked through the streets of Ouroboros as a commoner.\n\nAgainst the wishes of the Hounds of Hecate, she left her guards behind. Unarmored and unadorned, she stepped through the city streets, blending with the life of Ouroboros. She approached the markets, listening to the hustle and bustle as former tribals and raiders hawked their wares. She watched mothers purchasing little crafted toys for their children, a simple joy she had never known.\n\nShe spent time in the arena, observing the training of the Hounds as they prepared for future battles. Later, she visited the communal baths, sharing the space with others for the first time.\n\nAs the day drew to a close and merchants returned to their homes, she approached the base of the Dark Pyramid, her eyes tracing over the mosaic they had built during the structure's groundbreaking—a snake eating its own tail. Over the years, Hounds and Daughters had left flowers beside it, paying respects to those lost whom they care for.\n\nFinally, as the city rested still under the moon's warm embrace, Hecate found a small oak tree, grown from seeds from Diana's nursery. She pressed her back against it, sat on the ground, and opened the copy of 'Ruminating to Riches' she kept on her person."

It was taboo to accept a treasure from a Daughter of Hecate; Accepting these gifts meant pledging fealty to the Dark Mother, a path that promised strength and survival but at the cost of their independence. Whispers spread through the gathered tribals, eyes flickering between the gifts and the enigmatic figure. Some saw salvation and a chance to fight against the Legion; others saw a betrayal of their autonomy, a surrender to a power they neither trusted nor wanted.\n\nAs the tribe's leaders debated, the camp divided. A faction, inspired by the promises of power and hatred of the Legion, argued passionately for acceptance. They saw the Dark Mother as a savior, a beacon of hope in the wasteland. Opposing them were those who cherished their freedom above all, warning that this allegiance would bind them in chains as surely as any conqueror.

The Daughter, her voice as soothing as a summer breeze, promised them the greatest of these ancient flying machines. She spoke of untouched military caches and forgotten airfields where such relics lay dormant, waiting for the Uintah to awaken them. With these metal birds, she promised, they could ride the windstream and rain destruction upon the Legion, bringing an end to their tyranny from the skies above.\n\nYet, her words sowed discord among the Uinta. Some, their eyes filled with the gleam of new possibilities, saw her as a savior sent by Zephyr himself, a guide to reclaim the lost legacy of flight. They envisioned their tribe soaring above the wasteland, untouchable and free, their enemies obliterated by the might of their aerial prowess. Others, however, whispered of darker intentions. They feared that the Daughter of Hecate sought to supplant Zephyr, to turn their devotion to the Coyote into subservience to the Dark Mother. \n\nIn time, the Uintah would give in to the Daughter's wishes, accepting her gift."

Her words painted a vivid picture of a world engulfed in flames, a testament to their god, Phoenix, and a final judgment upon their enemies.\n\nYet, among the Crazy Horns, unease simmered beneath the surface.

The thought of their sacred fire being used for another's glory sowed seeds of doubt. However, for others, the promise of a cataclysmic blaze was intoxicating, an obsession that eclipsed all concerns.

The junction at Dead Horse Point, she explained, was pivotal for controlling transit into Arizona, a strategic advantage that would cement their influence and power. With the guidance and resources of Ouroboros, the tribe could fortify their home, perfect their hunting of bighorners, and become unrivaled in strength and respect.\n\nHowever, the promise of such power came with its own turmoil. Within the tribe, a faction argued fiercely for an alliance with the Legion, seeing it as a path to greater glory and immediate respect. The Dead Horses were renowned for their warrior prowess, and many felt that siding with the Legion would provide more immediate recognition and honor. The prospect of becoming subservient to the whims of the Dark Mother left some wary, fearing the loss of their autonomy and traditions.

This lab belonged to a small company known as 'AGRICOLA,' which was collaborating with the Alton Bourges Mining Concern to establish a research facility here in Burham Springs. The lab's purpose was to study a rare vein of a mineral called Ultracite, discovered by the Mining Concern during their excavations.\n\nMost Ultracite is located in the Appalachian Mountains, making this find outside of Appalachia particularly rare and valuable. Agricola, a modest company, was fortunate to secure the deal to help research this vein. According to the lab technicians' notes, Ultracite possesses unique and potent properties, which were the focus of their extensive research.

The first priority was to alleviate their constant pain. Initially, a prescription of hourly Med-X was administered, which worked for a time. However, as the patients developed tolerance, the dosage had to be increased. Eventually, Dr. Beyr discovered a remarkable solution; a small, invasive surgical procedure to nullify their sense of pain entirely.\n\nThe second step was to determine if the Gehennas were sapient. Although their vocal cords only allowed for grunts, some seemed to respond to sounds and signs. A few even demonstrated the ability to read and point out things with their large, gnarled hands. This ability to read in some of them lent credence to the theory that the Gehennas were once human.\n\nRecently, a small select group of Gehennas, led by Dr. Adrian Beyr who acts as their interpreter, has claimed fealty to Hecate. They are thankful for her decision to end their suffering. Despite some skepticism among others, who doubt whether Adrian is truly communicating with the Gehennas or merely inferring from their moods, this development has brought a new dimension to the relationship between Ouroboros and these tortured beings."

Hecate stood before a long, reflective obsidian table, its surface catching the pale light filtering through narrow windows high above. Upon the table lay three bows, each placed carefully by her Hounds as offerings, or perhaps as quiet gestures of respect. The first was of Twin Mothers make, its wood pale and smooth, adorned with delicate carvings of crescent moons and flowing rivers. The string was tight, the wood perfectly balanced—functional yet artful, a relic of a people who saw weapons as extensions of their spirit.\n\nThe second bow was crude yet sturdy, shaped by the calloused hands of one of her Hounds. The grip was wrapped in worn leather, its limbs reinforced with salvaged scrap metal plates. It spoke of utility and survival, a tool meant for war more than art. The third was curious—crafted by Adrian Beyr, her ever-pragmatic historian. The bow was sleek and mechanical, built with pre-war precision tools and featuring an intricate pulley system to enhance its draw. It lacked soul, but it held ingenuity in its polished joints and taut string.\n\nHecate reached out and ran her gloved fingertips over each weapon in turn. Each bow told a story: of tradition, of survival, of intellect. She lingered on Adrian's creation, tilting it slightly so its shadow fell across the others. For a brief moment, she allowed herself to think of the hands that had made them, the lives lived behind each choice of wood, metal, and string. Then, with a sigh, she turned away, her silhouette reflected in the table's surface—a fleeting image of the goddess of the Dark Moon, caught in stillness before fading into shadow."

With limited supplies, the Daughters turned to careful cross-pollination, blending resilient post-war plants with pre-war varieties to create something new. Hardy, yet beautiful—life capable of thriving even in poisoned soil.\n\nThe leaves overhead glowed amber, their eternal autumn preserved by the confused seasons of the wasteland. Each tree bore the mark of generations of careful tending, their roots sinking deep into the fertile ground carved out by faith and patience. Hecate walked slowly beneath the boughs, her boots crunching softly on dry leaves and brittle grass. The air smelled of damp earth and faint floral sweetness, carrying with it the distant sound of trickling water.\n\nIn the distance, a deer, a pre-war creature from Diana's Nursery, called out—a faint, hollow sound carried on the wind. Hecate paused, her gloved hand pressing lightly against the rough bark of a tree older than many of her followers. This place was young, and yet it felt timeless. A sanctuary not born of accident, but of intention—a careful rebellion against the harshness of the wasteland beyond. She closed her eyes for a moment, breathing in the quiet, the stillness, the fragile beauty nurtured by the hands of her Daughters. Then, with a faint smile playing at the edges of her lips, she stepped deeper into the grove, her silhouette swallowed by amber and shadow."

For a long moment, neither goddess nor prey moved, both locked in a fragile stillness. Then, with a soft exhale, Hecate began to move. Her steps were careful, her boots finding purchase on dry earth without a single misstep.\n\nThe hunt stretched for hours, winding through thickets of twisted branches and across narrow, moss-covered creeks. The deer moved with grace, a ghost flickering between the shadows of the grove. Hecate followed, her breath steady, her focus absolute. This was no idle chase—this was something ancient, something primal. Her world shrank to the soft crunch of leaves underfoot, the faint glint of moonlight on the deer's hide, and the steady rhythm of her own beating heart.\n\nAt last, the moment came. The deer paused in a narrow clearing, breath misting in the night air. Hecate drew the bow she had carried with her—a weapon chosen hours ago from the reflective obsidian table—and loosed a single arrow. The sound of the string snapping back echoed briefly before silence reclaimed the grove. The deer fell, and Hecate approached slowly, her breath still steady, her expression unreadable. As she knelt beside her fallen quarry, a strange calm washed over her. For a brief instant, she remembered something—a memory, a fragment of a time before the Dark Pyramid, before Ouroboros, before even the Nursery. It flickered, warm and fragile, before fading into the night."

This approach necessitates overcoming a well-fortified Legion encampment, to build a succesful beachhead will require we train our Hounds the best we can.\n\nThe second plan involves arming our merchant fleet for a naval invasion, bypassing Dead Horse Point.

The atmosphere was electric, charged with the thirst for knowledge and the reverence for the Dark Mother's teachings.\n\nHecate felt a pull, a desire to connect with her followers in this moment of shared enlightenment.

As she walked through the tranquil sanctuary, Diana's divine voice emanated from nowhere in particular, filling the air with a calm presence.\n\nObserving Hecate's hardened demeanor and the fire of vengeance still burning in her eyes, Diana felt a deep sense of pity. She offered Hecate a place in the Nursery, a sanctuary where she could find rest and peace, away from the endless battles and darkness that consumed her.\n\nHecate, with the weight of her unfinished battles still pressing upon her, declined the offer. She knew that her path was not yet complete, and that she still had many battles to face before she could consider such peace.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Hecate left the Nursery, carrying Diana's words with her, even as she walked back into the shadows."

As she walked through the peaceful haven, Diana's divine voice filled the air, emanating from nowhere in particular.\n\nObserving Hecate's composed demeanor and the clarity in her eyes, Diana felt a deep sense of pride. She reminisced over the night they first met, recalling the lost and vengeful woman who had stumbled into her paradise. Hecate had grown since then, her spirit tempered by wisdom and experience.\n\nDiana, pleased with Hecate's transformation, offered her a tome of her choice from her ancient libraries, a gift of knowledge and history. Along with this, Diana extended the same offer she had once made; a place in the Nursery, a sanctuary where Hecate could find rest and peace whenever she grew weary of her battles.\n\nThis time, Hecate considered the offer more thoughtfully. She acknowledged that one day, when her people no longer needed her guidance and their future was secure, she might seek the tranquility of the Nursery. With gratitude, she accepted the tome, knowing that her journey was not yet complete, but that peace awaited her when the time was right."

  nf_oro_ttm.4.d:0 "With meticulous planning and the combined efforts of the Daughters and Hounds of Hecate, an uplink was established between the power grids of Ouroboros and the Nursery. The Nursery, with its near-unlimited energy reserves required to create a G.E.C.K., could afford to siphon a small amount to aid the people of Ouroboros without much issue.\n\nAs the first wave of energy surged through the newly laid cables, small lanterns throughout Ouroboros flickered to life. Ouroboros was built from the ground up as a city that could maximize natural lighting - reflective lenses in most homes amplifying the light of the moon to allow the people to work when others would sleep. This, however, didn't work when the moon was cloaked by clouds. For the first time, the city's streets were bathed in a continuous, gentle glow from these 'Godlights.' The artificial amber light - seen by the people of Ouroboros as a gift from Diana - brought a sense of security and progress, transforming the way the people of Ouroboros lived and thought.\n\nThe Godlights provided comfort during the darkest nights, their warm glow symbolizing hope and unity. Children played under their soft radiance, traders extended their hours, and families gathered in the evening, sharing stories and strengthening their bonds. This divine illumination changed the physical and spiritual landscape of Ouroboros, filling its people with a renewed sense of optimism and resilience."

  nf_oro_ttm.5.d:0 "In an act of unity and mutual respect, Diana and Hecate came together to build a grand temple dedicated to their shared faith. Constructed from slick, gleaming ivory, the temple stands tall and majestic, reminiscent of the Parthenon from a distant, ancient world. Its towering columns and intricately carved friezes tell tales of divine power and shared wisdom. Inside, the temple is adorned with artful tapestries and murals that depict the histories and philosophies of both the Twin Mothers and the Daughters of Hecate. The air is always fragrant with the scent of fresh pre-war fruits from the Nursery, a rare and cherished delicacy.\nThe temple serves as a vibrant center for intellectual and spiritual exchange, where members of the Twin Mothers and the Daughters of Hecate gather regularly for debates and discussions. The furniture within the temple is crafted from fine, polished wood from the Nychthemeron grove, with each piece reflecting the artistry and craftsmanship of both tribes. Elegant chairs and tables, adorned with delicate carvings of ancient symbols, provide a comfortable setting for these lively exchanges.\nTraining new members is a crucial function of the temple, and it is here that the future Daughters of Hecate and Priestesses of the Twin Mothers receive their education. In the temple's spacious courtyards and serene gardens, novices practice their rituals and hone their skills under the watchful eyes of their mentors. They learn the sacred texts, the art of debate, and the practical skills needed to serve their people.\n\nIn time, the Two Moons Temple would be one of the great wonders of the Wasteland. A center of research, study, and one of the hopes for the new world."

  nf_oro_lab.1.t:0 "A Meeting of Minds"
  nf_oro_lab.1.d:0 "In the quiet sanctity of a secluded chamber within the Dark Pyramid, Hecate and Dr. Adrian Beyr sat across from one another, engaged in one of their frequent exchanges. The room, adorned with finely carved wood from the Nychthemeron grove, radiated an air of calm refinement, a stark contrast to the heavy subjects often broached within its walls. They sipped freshly grown wine, its warm notes softening the edges of their guarded but familiar rapport. Adrian, as always, wore his tattered Followers of the Apocalypse jacket, a constant reminder of the ideals he had never entirely abandoned.\n\nTheir conversations were an intellectual dance—sharp, probing, and layered with unspoken trust and tension. Hecate leaned forward as Adrian mused on philosophical ideas and observations of the wasteland, her golden eyes intent, her presence commanding yet oddly human in these moments. But as their dialogue shifted, Adrian skillfully steered it toward a subject she rarely addressed; the old lab. Hecate's posture stiffened slightly, a subtle sign of her reluctance. She waved the topic aside with practiced indifference, dismissing it as a failed venture. Adrian, however, recognized the avoidance for what it was and pressed forward."
  nf_oro_lab.1.a:0 "..."

  nf_oro_lab.2.t:0 "The Weight of the Past"
  nf_oro_lab.2.d:0 "The light of the chamber lamp flickered unevenly as Adrian spoke, his voice steady but insistent. He began recounting the grim details of Hecate's experiments at the old lab—a chapter of her past steeped in a pursuit of 'perfection.' He described the invasive trials, the manipulation of genetics, and the pain endured by those subjected to her quest to create a people capable of defying Caesar's might.\n\nAs Adrian delved deeper, Hecate's initial dismissiveness began to harden into silence. He explained the devastating effects of eugenics: how it undermined adaptability and strength rather than fostering them, how it was rooted in flawed ideals of control, and how it left nothing but scars and suffering in its wake. The lab, Adrian insisted, was more than a misstep—it was a stain on everything she claimed to stand for now.\n\nHecate leaned back, her expression unreadable, though the slight tension in her hand betrayed her inner conflict. Adrian leaned forward, unwavering, and spoke with uncharacteristic fervor. 'If you truly want to lead these people to something greater, you must let this go. Destroy the lab, abandon this madness, and never return to it.' His words hung in the air like a challenge, daring her to reconcile her vision of the future with the shadows of her past."
  nf_oro_lab.2.a:0 "..."


  nf_oro_lab.3.t:0 "Reflections in the Forgotten Lab"
  nf_oro_lab.3.d:0 "Some time later, Hecate found herself wandering the dusty, abandoned lab where her past experiments had taken place. The air was thick with memories, each piece of equipment a reminder of her relentless pursuit of an impossible ideal. She ran her hand over a particular vial, the glass cool and smooth under her fingertips. Adrian's words echoed in her mind, a somber reminder of the harm her actions had caused. She wondered if, perhaps, she had been missing something crucial all along—if her experiments had failed not because of flawed technique, but because of a flawed outlook. Standing in the dim light of the lab, Hecate felt a rare moment of vulnerability. Adrian was asking that Hecate tear down the old lab - it wouldn't be difficult to do so. She had long ago let the lab languish into obscurity given her growing frustration with the lack of clear results from all of her hard work.\n\nA part of her, the part of her that hated admitting being wrong, was tempted to restart the lab, to take her research in a new direction with a revised understanding. Yet, Adrian's advice lingered; dismantle the lab, abandon the pursuit of perfection, and instead trust her people to carry their strength forward on their own, to let go. The choice was hers to make, and for the first time, Hecate felt the heavy burden of her decisions not just as a leader, but as the cultivator of her people's future."
  nf_oro_lab.3.a:0 "§RThis time will be different.§!"
  nf_oro_lab.3.a.tt:0 "§gHecate stands before the ruin of her past and does not turn away—she sees now that her pursuit of perfection was folly, not because she sought to reshape humanity, but because she sought to deny the truths the wasteland had already written. Evolution did not fail; it simply took a different path, one she must embrace rather than resist.\n\nShe decrees that Ouroboros will no longer shun mutation, but accept it as the future, welcoming the downtrodden into her fold. Those twisted by radiation and time shall no longer be cast aside but shall rise as her chosen, reforged not by eugenics, but by the wasteland itself. If she wills it, their strength need not be freely given—if they will not offer it, she may take it, carving the truth of mutation from their very flesh.§!"
  nf_oro_lab.3.b:0 "§MIt's time to let go.§!"
  nf_oro_lab.3.b.tt:0 "§gHecate looks upon her works and knows that perfection was never in the blood, but in the will—the traditions, the culture, the faith of her people. The lab was not merely a mistake; it was a rejection of the very strength she sought to cultivate. She steps beyond its ruins and into the arms of the unclaimed, casting aside the illusion of control to embrace the power of devotion.\n\nThe scattered tribes, long wary of her hand, are offered a place within Ouroboros, their customs and wisdom woven into the Dark Mother's design. But if she so chooses, she may reach out not in mercy, but in conquest—tearing their secrets from them, ensuring that even in defiance, they serve her will.§!"

Metternich reflects on his journey, noting the relentless determination of his colleague, Lorenzo Cabot. Metternich's contributions, particularly his electrical sensing apparatus, proved crucial in Cabot's discoveries.\n\nIn another entry from Saturday, 13th April, 1897, Metternich recalls the Greco-Turkish War, a time marked by danger and opportunity. He recounts his expedition to the island of Crete, where he aimed to save priceless relics from destruction. Among these, Metternich took the Knossos Sarcophagus, a significant Greek artifact, with the intention of preserving it. Eventually, the sarcophagus was sold to an American collector."
  oro_dianas_journal:0 "§MA Study of Exotic Matter§!"
  oro_dianas_journal_desc:0 "A scientific journal, dated before the great war, features a peer-reviewed paper by Diana Stone, a recent MIT graduate. In her study, Stone explores the concept of matter transmutation, proposing that subjecting matter to extreme energy levels, such as through the detonation of high-yield nuclear weapons, can hyper-energize that matters constituent particles, causing them to lose interactions with ordinary matter. This phenomenon could create a state akin to a highly advanced form of Quark-Gluon Plasma, a state of matter that theoretically existed only in the conditions shortly after the Big Bang.\n\nIn this state, dubbed "Hyper-Matter," the particles exhibit properties that render them almost completely inert to the fundamental forces and interactions governing ordinary matter. Consequently, matter in this state would effectively bypass many of the conventional laws of thermodynamics, potentially leading to novel applications and insights into fundamental physics. Stone's hypothesis opens new avenues for exploring the boundary between known matter and the exotic states that might exist under extreme conditions."

Marcella was investigating a cursed object known as the Krivbeknih, a twisted and malevolent book written by followers of something unknowable. For a long time, the book was in the possession of the Blackhall family near Point Lookout.\nAnother excerpt delves into the research conducted by another agent operating in the American Southwest. This agent believed they had found a lead suggesting that an old member of the Blackhall family, before the Great War, had attempted to create an incomplete transcription of the Krivbeknih. The trail, unfortunately, went cold near the Colorado River, leaving the transcription's fate shrouded in mystery."

Built predominantly from synthetic obsidian, its jagged skyline absorbs the day's harsh light and transforms under the moon's glow into a glittering nocturnal citadel. The city's rooftops are adorned with reflective panels, ingeniously amplifying moonlight to bathe the streets in an ethereal shimmer, rendering artificial lights unnecessary and keeping the city concealed from the prying eyes of the Legion. At its core stands the Pyramid of the Dark Moon, a monolithic structure embodying both divine purpose and industrial might, its gold-and-uranium apex glimmering ominously in the night sky. Ouroboros thrives as both sanctuary and fortress, a testament to Hecate's vision, where devotion, ingenuity, and shadow converge into an enduring legacy."

Wherever they plant their banner, it becomes a battlefield in waiting, a place where discipline and debauchery go hand in hand. Their camp here is no exception, a rough-hewn fortress of salvaged metal and firelit revelry, where the night is filled with the roar of drunken warriors, the clash of friendly blades, and the ever-present hum of a fight about to begin. It is a place of killers, hardened and ready, waiting only for war to call them forward."
