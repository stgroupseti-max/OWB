  vip_the_first_snakekeeper_desc: "When Jonathan Faust led his people in the exodus from the overcrowded Vault 15, he stumbled, quite literally, into a pit of vipers. Thinking him for dead his people pondered what to do now, when he emerged a week after his fall as a changed man.\nThe §GGreat Snake§! had chosen him."
  vip_a_time_of_strength: "A Time of Strength"
  vip_a_time_of_strength_desc: "Over the following years the Vipers, as we now called ourselves, grew in number and strength. We became the terror of central California, raiding and razing settlements wherever we went."
  vip_the_shattering_of_the_tribe: "The Shattering of the Tribe"
  vip_the_shattering_of_the_tribe_desc: "A fateful encounter with a Brotherhood patrol led to our eventual downfall. A (un)lucky arrow killed the High Elder Maxson II, who was accompanying the patrol. The Brotherhood's vengeance eventually broke the tribe and scattered us across the Wasteland. This particular splinter ended up in Nevada."

  vip_proving_our_worth_desc:0 "The shadows of our past defeats linger, but no more. New Reno stands as a symbol of opportunity, a chance to prove that the Vipers are still a force to be reckoned with. As we raid its streets and claim its spoils, we send a message across the wasteland: The Vipers have returned, stronger and more deadly than ever. The time of skulking in the shadows is over. It's time for the world to feel our venom once again."
  vip_indoctrinating_tourists:0 "Indoctrinating Tourists"
  vip_indoctrinating_tourists_desc:0 "New Reno, now under our coils, teems with unsuspecting tourists. They come seeking pleasure, unaware that they're about to find a higher calling. Through our rituals and teachings, these tourists will shed their old skins and embrace the way of the Viper. Each indoctrinated soul not only strengthens our ranks but also spreads our influence far beyond the city limits. Let the serpentine gospel of the Vipers echo through every caravan and settlement."
  vip_bringing_in_the_jackals:0 "Bringing in the Jackals"
  vip_bringing_in_the_jackals_desc:0 "The Jackals, stubborn and wild, have resisted our efforts to bring them into the fold. It's time to change tactics; a little coercion might bend them to our will. By showing our might and offering them a share of our plunder, we can convince them to join our crusade. United, the Vipers and Jackals can become a formidable force, one that the wasteland will fear and respect."
  vip_seizing_the_vault:0 "Seizing the Vault"
  vip_seizing_the_vault_desc:0 "Vault City, with its pristine walls and untold riches, denied us sanctuary in our time of need. Now, it's time for retribution. Their denial will be their downfall. We'll storm their gates, plunder their wealth, and show them the might of the Vipers. This raid isn't just about resources; it's about sending a message: none can deny the Vipers and live without consequence."
  vip_serpent_lords_of_the_big_circle:0 "Serpent Lords of the Big Circle"
  vip_serpent_lords_of_the_big_circle_desc:0 "Control of the Big Circle, a massive trade route in northwestern Nevada, is now in our grasp. Our influence and power stretch across the land, and traders whisper our name in fear and respect. With every caravan that passes through, our strength grows. The wasteland has learned a new truth: The Vipers are not only survivors; we are conquerors, rulers of the trade routes, unchallenged and supreme."

  vip_no_step_on_snek: "Looking Back"
  vip_no_step_on_snek_desc: "We are just a shadow of our former self, reduced to common raiders using whatever weapons we can find and surviving by ambushing lone travellers. We could be so much more, we should be more, we once ruled the Californian wasteland."
	vip_high_priestess: "High Priestess?"
  vip_high_priestess_desc: "A step in the right direction would be bringing back the old titles. Our leaders were known as the Great Snakekeeper, but traditionally they were all male.

  vip_new_sources_of_poison: "New Sources of §PVenom§!"
  vip_new_sources_of_poison_desc: "Access to the Shrine was lost long ago. Even the barrels of snakes we carried are only a memory. Still, there are ways to acquire the toxins needed to supply our weapons with the necessary sting. Ant, radscorpion, and cazadore §Pvenom§! all share characteristics with our ancestral tool, albeit, in a lesser form."
  vip_bringing_back_the_rituals: "Return of the Rituals"
  vip_bringing_back_the_rituals_desc: "Our people were strong because we rid ourselves of the weak. To be worthy in the eyes of the §GGreat Snake§!, one had to routinely consume a §Pvenom§! and alcohol cocktail, with a special mixture of §Pvenom§! reserved for those who wished to become a warrior.\nBy the §GGreat Snake§!, let our new §Pvenom§! work the same."
  vip_slave_raids: "Sacrifices to the §GGreat Snake§!"
  vip_slave_raids_desc: "The §GGreat Snake§! requires sacrifices. It would be a poor choice to sacrifice our own people, we've already lost enough to other rituals. We'll capture others, and force them to endure the trial of poison. If they survive, they're strong enough to join. If they don't, they were a sacrifice."
  vip_crimson_tongues: "The Return of the §RCrimson Tongues§!"
  vip_crimson_tongues_desc: "The §RCrimson Tongues§! were the elite warriors among the Vipers of old. While few of our crop come close to their level of skill, bestowing them a new title may act as encouragement."

  vip_the_vision: "The Vision"
  vip_the_vision_desc: "During the monthly trance, Veronica had a vision revealing our ancestral land. The location was hazy, but what was certain was the image of a standing Shrine. The land being under NCR control is a challenge, but challenge is a Viper's closest friend."
  vip_gearing_up_for_war: "Gearing up for War"
  vip_gearing_up_for_war_desc: "These \"Pit Viper Teeth\" we've been relegated to using are fakes, as we don't actually own any pit vipers. They're just sharpened bones, but our warriors have gotten remarkably proficient at using them.\nSoon, to be good enough to make use of them in taking back the Shrine."

  vip_vipers_reborn: "Vipers Reborn"
  vip_vipers_reborn_desc: "Around the Pit gathered our entire clan in trance, our history manifested in a forty foot fall.\nThe Brotherhood attack on our camp destroyed much of it, yet some features lingered on. Among them, Asp Faust's throne, a seat of bones and carnage from centuries long past.\nWith none left to vanquish them, our §Pvenomous§! kin have even begun to slither down from forgotten caverns. Yet, our greatest foe remains. Their bodies will make the fall, and the Pit will sing once again, its §Pvenom§! to haunt the wastes forevermore."

  vip_legacy_of_great_snake: "Legacy of the §GGreat Snake§!"
  vip_legacy_of_great_snake_desc: "Decades before the Vipers were forced to flee California by the Brotherhood of Steel, the Vipers worshipped their §GGreat Snake§! god. Their entire lives and cultures revolved around the §GGreat Snake§!, and its poison: sacrifices were made to it, its poison was ritually consumed and weapons were made smothered in its §Pvenom§!. While they lost access to their shrine, with it being most likely being destroyed by the Brotherhood when they finally drove the Vipers from California, fragments of the Vipers' old religion remains. One of the most important lessons that has survived the hard years the Vipers have wandered in the wasteland is regarding survival of the fittest. Sure, some half-decent cannon fodder may die before their time, but this way the Vipers are strong."

  vip_a_broken_tribe:0 "A Shattered Tribe"
  vip_a_broken_tribe_desc:0 "When a band of Vipers set upon a patrolling group of the Brotherhood of Steel in 2155, they had no idea who they were making enemies with. In the resulting fight the leader of the small Brotherhood patrol group, a certain Maxson II, was struck and fatally injured by a poisoned arrow. Unfortunately for the Vipers, Maxson II was none other than the Brotherhood's High Elder: his death stirred the Brothehood up into a genocidal fury. By 2161, after 6 years of being hounded relentlessly by the Brotherhood, the Vipers finally shattered. Bands fled across America, with some settling in the Mojave, some in Nevada and some as far afield as the Hounds of Hecate. The Vipers are a mere shadow of their former selves."
