    nf_bam.1.d:0 "Ship-Breaker stared out the trawler's port side window. The waves were starting to get more shallow, and the ship's wake grew less stark. "Guess we're here, eh?" He turned back to the empty plate on the table in front of him, wishing he hadn't been so hasty.\nHis two companions looked up from their readings. "Seems like it," Susan noted.\n"Well, that wasn't nearly as long as I thought it'd be." Chaco, the mayor's scrawny advisor, stood up and stretched. "Will you be in your office tomorrow morning, mayor?"\nShip-Breaker sighed. "Yeah, I'll be in."\n"Good. See you then." The advisor opened the cabin door and walked out of sight. Ship-Breaker and Susan sat quietly for a moment, listening to the ruckus outside.\n"Well, thanks again for the interview, Mr. Mayor sir. I'll make sure it gets out in the weekly paper next Sunday. It was a pleasure.""
    nf_bam.1.a:0 "§gSusan extended her hand across the table, and Ship-Breaker shook it.§!"

    nf_bam_events_continued.1.t:0 "Man of Many Jobs, Continued"
    nf_bam_events_continued.1.d:0 "Susan stood up and quickly reached for her pen and notepad. "I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor. While I'm on the job it's titles and last names only. If you want to find me after hours, then maybe you could give me something else, but the sun's still in the sky and I have a job to do." She patted herself down and sighed. "Thank you again, though. Honestly." She gave the mayor a light bow and walked out. The mayor gave her a half-hearted wave that she had turned too fast to see. There was a dull thud as the boat thumped up against the dock. Ship-Breaker sat quietly in the lunchroom cabin for another few minutes before finally standing to leave. His back and belly ached.\nAs he climbed up the awkwardly-built stairs to the BMV Topper's main deck, the captain of the vessel noticed him and strutted over. He shouted a few final orders to his crew and then addressed the mayor with a shake.\n"Well, I trust everything went well?"\n"Yes, thank you again for letting me tag along, useless as I may have been. It's always nice to get out and not worry about doing all the work myself." He smiled, remembering his old vessel. The USS Bayview had been a ship far too large for Ship-Breaker to operate alone, but he had done so nonetheless. Over the years it received its fair share of scratches and dents, but it had worked out in the end. If only it hadn't got out that his bastard parents were responsible for one of the most high-profile murders of the century, maybe he could've found a respectable crew to hire...\n"Always a pleasure, Mr. Mayor." He snapped out of this thoughts. "Well, I've got fish to unload. Got a good haul today. Enjoy yourself, and lemme know if you ever need a quiet spot again." Ship-Breaker nodded appreciatively and wandered over to the gangplank. He almost tripped on the way down, but he caught himself and inwardly chuckled at the thought that he'd never once tripped on his own ship. He wasn't that old just yet."
    nf_bam_events_continued.1.a:0 ""His ship was very pretty.""

    nf_bam.2.t:0 "Friendly Passersby"
    nf_bam.2.d:0 "Mayor Ship-Breaker meandered up the Cannery port with his hands in his trenchcoat's pockets, nodding in friendly greeting to nigh on every sailor and fisherman he passed by. Of course, his nods were only a reluctant response to everyone else nodding first. A few of the waterside number even stopped to ask questions or try to make small talk, and Ship-Breaker obliged them as long as they were willing to walk with him. None stuck around for more than a minute or so at a time. By the time he'd made it from the port to the boardwalk he'd probably greeted a hundred individuals, with many more taking note of his presence from a distance. He found a bench and sat down. The sun rested high overhead, and the sound of seagulls screaming at each other and men and women shouting over the dozens of docked vessels by the port were a relaxing background. He leaned back and closed his eyes.\nBy the time he woke, the sun had turned the southern sky an artistic gradient of red and yellow. Ship-Breaker moved his arm up to wipe the slobber from his mouth, and he stretched a little."

    nf_bam_events_continued.2.d:0 "Ship-Breaker wasn't surprised—nothing ever seems to surprise you when you're this old—but he did look over to see Susan sitting on the bench next to him. She looked markedly older without the mask of makeup she normally wore on the reporting job. "Enjoying the view, or just letting everyone else enjoy seeing you?"\nThe mayor chuckled. "It's not been a good day," he said. "Just feeling nostalgic. That's all."\nShe sighed. "I feel you. Wasn't too long ago I was just a writer girl in Cypermort and you were just the weirdo murderer's kid with a boat as big as your head. I miss those days, sometimes. But my kids never understood whenever I'd tell them so." She laughed. "Now they've got their own boats and I'm writing for a paper that didn't exist half a century ago when I wanted to be a reporter."\nShip-Breaker reached over and patted her leg. "Well, you got your dream. Be happy with it."\n"I am." She sighed again and stood up. "Just wish James was still here to see it."\n"Yeah. I miss him." The mayor stood up as well. "You going somewhere in particular?"\n"Probably Glenn's Bar. Lotta visitors in town and I want to scout for some stories about other places. You wanna tag along?"\n"The mercenaries might open up a bit if they see the mayor around. They do love bragging about their adventures. Walk with me." The sun crested beneath the horizon as the pair slowly wandered off."
    nf_bam_events_continued.2.a:0 ""Everyone knows us for our good fish.""
    nf_bam_events_continued.2.b:0 ""We get lots of fighters coming through.""

    nf_bam.3.d:0 ""And I'm tellin' ya, this whale's gotta've been mutated or somethin'. It was insane!"\nThe sailor's buddy leaned in close. "And the coolest part? Bugger had an entire bumper sword stickin' right outa its forehead! Some mutant or somethin' musta gotten up close and personal 'cause that thing just didn't wanna die!"\nSusan finished taking notes and set her pen down. "Well, that does surely sound like an amazing tale. Was it just you two, or did anyone else see it firsthand?"\n"Well, we, uh..." The two boys looked at each other. They couldn't have been more than twenty, the mayor thought. "Oh! Obviously dad was there, right?" The other boy nodded vigorously. "Dan Rancher. He's our dad. Saw the whole thing. Lives out by the west pier in the red houseboat with green stripes. Tell 'em we said hi, alright?"\n"I'll do that tomorrow when I follow up on this. Thank you for your side of things." She marked down the name and description of the other witness and slid two shot glasses across the table to the pair."
    nf_bam.3.a:0 ""As we discussed. Pleasure doing business.""

    nf_bam_events_continued.3.t:0 "The Foundation of a Home, Continued"
    nf_bam_events_continued.3.d:0 ""Well, that seemed to be a successful interview," Ship-Breaker remarked. He downed his own shot of moonshine. His neck crumpled in on itself for a moment, then returned to normal with a warm glow in his belly. "This..." He coughed. "This stuff's awful. Love it."\nSusan giggled a bit. "Well, it'll make for a good story, if it holds up under cross-examination." She took a sip of her own very non-alcoholic water. Then she looked around the bar. She stood up and spoke loudly. "Anyone else got any stories for the Sunday paper? Paying with drinks!" There were a few light grunts from around the bar, but only one man with a multitude of facial scars and a weather-beaten leather jacket walked over. He sat down at the table and Susan settled back in. "So, what's your name and what's your story?"\nThe man pulled a pipe from his coat and lit it. Ship-Breaker sensed a source of companionship and pulled his own pipe. He passed it to the scarred man, who lit it without a word. The mayor nodded thanks and took a puff. "I've got more stories than you could fill in a year of papers," he started in a gruff voice, "but I'm not here for you." Susan leaned back and gave an indignant face. "Mr. Ship-Breaker." The mayor looked at the man, unconcerned. "I've got a life of experience in port raids and piracy. I'm the type of man you wouldn't want on this island. But I want to retire, and I want to get one over on a crew that betrayed me. If you'll have me, I can give a handful of pointers you might find handy."\nShip-Breaker raised an eyebrow. "I'm curious. Your name?"\n"Captain Clyde. Used to man the privateer vessel Benedicto's Tears."\n"I remember stories of that ship. Meet me at my office in the Mama Dolces tomorrow." The man nodded and stood up. He left the bar without another word, leaving Susan rather confused and Ship-Breaker eager to hear the advice of an equal peer."
    nf_bam_events_continued.3.a:0 "He knew we'd need to hold our own."
    nf_bam_events_continued.3.b:0 "He figured the swamps changed things."
    nf_bam_events_continued.3.c:0 "He was always an aggressive fellow."

    nf_bam.4.t:0 "Waves in the Bayou"
    nf_bam.4.d:0 ""Well, it's a good thing we caught them." Ship-Breaker's makeshift perch on the south-facing side of his office had a wonderful view over the flat terrain of Marsh Island. Carved out of the side of the Mama Dulces—the beached factory ship that housed the vast majority of The Cannery's canning operations, as well as a small complex of office spaces surrounding the mayor's office—it provided both a strategic outlook to get a feel for the island's nature while also being an excellent place to take a quick breather. "I've been looking at the numbers. We're doing well on our end, but there's a few customers down in Cuba who really need that shipment. I'll be glad to see it properly defended and on its way."\n"Very good, Mr. Mayor sir. Should I let them know they're cleared to launch?"\n"Aye, do that. And have them double check their ammunition storage just in case."\n"Got it." Ship-Breaker's assistant left the room. The mayor continued staring out over the swampy ground of the island's center. The Mama Dulces had been beached in the swamp on the northern side of the island, so from any of its windows or perches ten stories up, its southern view gave a clear shot over the entire island and to the horizon beyond. Towards the western flank of the island a forest had been growing strong. Paths of plank and loose gravel crisscrossed the island at a few points, though most of the roads ended up either at the Cannery ship and the residential structures surrounding it or at the port town at the southeastern tip of the island. Ship-Breaker smiled when a small flock of waterfowl flew past the Dulces's stern, quacking all the way. It was a very relaxing place to stand, and it helped calm down his occasional stomach aches."
    nf_bam.4.a:0 "§gAfter another few minutes of wistful gazing, a knock at the door pulled him from his thoughts.§!"

    nf_bam_events_continued.4.t:0 "Waves in the Bayou, Continued"
    nf_bam_events_continued.4.d:0 ""Don't thank me," she said, thrusting the bundle into the mayor's arms. "Belated official gift from the Bayou Post as thanks for an interview a few months back with the acting CEO of the Bayou Motors, among other such nonsense titles." She smiled. "It's been a few weeks since we talked. Just figured I'd stop by and see how you're doin'."\nThe mayor grunted. "Don't remind me. Pirates barely caught because one of them tripped an alarm we only knew to set because an ex-pirate wandered in off the waves offering his services, record profits despite average nutritional intake spiraling downward, and now this business with Texas and the rest of Louisiana getting all uppity about conquests for some reason. What a mess." He left the office, closing and locking the door behind him.\n"Well, are you doing anything for the rest of the day? I just thought maybe it'd make a good story if the old mayor was there when the big shipment left, seeing as how it gave us all those free headlines with the pirates." They both chuckled, and Ship-Breaker almost forgot to duck as he walked through one of the Dulces's far-too-small doors.\n"Alright, I don't think I'm doing much else." He smiled and smelled the flowers. They'd make for a good gift for the transport ship's captain."
    nf_bam_events_continued.4.a:0 ""Let's head down and see them off.""

    nf_bam.5.t:0 "Clear Skies"
    nf_bam.5.d:0 "The fishing trawler's horn blared out across the port and the BMV Topper began to pull away. Mayor Ship-Breaker rested cautiously on the port side railing, and he waved goodbye to the small crowd that had gathered around the vessel. He'd be back, he knew, but he needed to get away from it for a bit. All of it.\n"So, mayor, how's it feel to be free?"\nOk, maybe not all of it. "Refreshing. The island smells like home, but the sea smells like life. I love it out here." He smiled. "A shame we had to leave so early if we're to make the Cuban markets by Tuesday. I would've liked to have more time to say goodbye. And to grab a drink."\nSusan laughed. "Don't worry, we packed the entire hold full of moonshine, and the captain's said you specifically can have as much as you want.""
    nf_bam.5.a:0 ""All we need to do... Are... Are you ok?""

    nf_bam_events_continued.5.t:0 "Clear Skies, Continued"
    nf_bam_events_continued.5.d:0 ""Sorry. I've been getting occasional stomach pains for the last year or so." He laughed bitterly while he stood back up. "Part of the reason I needed an extended vacation is so I can start weaning the Cannery off of my presence. I haven't seen a doctor about it, but I can tell this is a long-term thing." He leaned back over the ship's railing and stared at the orange slowly cresting over the horizon. "I've been around a long time, but someday I won't be. I'd prefer the Cannery learned to keep going without me, since I'm still around to correct their moves. For now."\n"I... I didn't know." Ship-Breaker turned his head to the side and noticed Susan's face had gone pale. She looked horrified. "How long do you think...?"\n"Oh, I'm no doctor. Probably a year or so. It had to happen sooner or later, and I've had a great run, given what it might've been."\nSusan put her right arm around Ship-Breaker's back and leaned her head onto his shoulder. "I'm so sorry. I wish I'd have known. Maybe I'd..."\n"You'd what?" The mayor laughed softly. "No, this is the right way for it to go. I've seen my people through more crises than most men would expect to read in history books throughout their lives, and we've made the world around us a better place. All we wanted was peace, and we fought to keep that peace. All that coming from a boy who grew up on his own without so much as a family to look after. Isn't that noble enough for you?"\n"Yeah, but it's kinda sad, don't you think?"\n"Hm. Maybe." They were quiet for a moment while the sun fully emerged into the morning sky. "But hey, for what it's worth, I imagine I'll get a very fancy front-page obituary when I kick it, so that's got to be worth something." Aside from occasional seagull squawks from a cohort of birds that decided to hitch a ride, the rest of the sunrise was spent in silence, with Ship-Breaker's left hand on the railing and Susan's right hand on his."

    nf_bam.6.t:0 "Another Pirate Raid" #pirate raid
    nf_bam.6.d:0 "The mayor was having a wonderfully peaceful night's sleep when a boom roared across The Cannery's dockside village. Startled awake, Ship Breaker sat up in bed, rubbed his face, and reached for the glasses at the side of his bed. Fumbling, he accidentally knocked them off the nightstand and onto the floor. He groaned and got out of bed, being careful not to step on the glasses. When he put them onto his face and looked out the window, his face fell into a posture of grim anger. It was still dark outside, but a large plume of smoke could be seen rising in the distant light of the port. He threw on his trenchcoat and rushed out the door.\nIt only took him a few minutes to get to the port, given his residence was built as close to the port as could be managed without intruding on the portside storage buildings. He saw Clyde—the ex-pirate security man—standing with a few cyan-uniformed guards. He walked up to them, lightly running his fingers over a combat knife in his right pocket.\n"Mayor."\n"Clyde. What happened?""
    nf_bam.6.a:0 ""Pirate attack, Mayor.""

    nf_bam_events_continued.6.d:0 "Ship-Breaker grimaced. "The Louch. Isn't that the Cuban cargo ship we've been loading fish and shrimp onto for the last month?"\n"Yup. Their plan—my plan, originally—was to use dynamite to blow up the steel gates protecting the port and just make a clean getaway into the night. The fools didn't change the plan when they mutinied. I won't object to hunting down their ship, if it suits you. I'd just need a few men at my back and I could convince my former crew to come quietly and retire alongside myself. But if you take the ship and decide to use it for combat, I'd like to be made captain of it one last time. You can trust me not to jeopardize my retirement plan." The pair chuckled.\n"Very well, we'll add it to our collection. Thanks again for helping out."\n"Just doing my job, mayor." Ship-Breaker stuck around long enough to help count casualties and treat the wounded of the port gate explosion. Two prisoners were taken from the bridge of the Leeroy's Louch, but they were both young lads who wouldn't be of much use either as captives or intelligence sources. Eventually Ship-Breaker got tired, and a sudden aching reminded him that he should be in bed. So that's where he went. The rest of the issue could wait until morning."

    news_bam_oh_he_dead.1.d:0 "BREAKING NEWS: Former Mayor Ship-Breaker has sadly passed away as of today. Moving on at the ripe age of 81, he helped found The Cannery many decades ago and was a much-beloved figure even through the later years of his life. He had no children, but he made it clear through his every word and action that he treated the residents of The Cannery as his family. Having led the settlement for many years and helmed our people through multiple diplomatic and military crises, he did his best to ensure The Cannery of tomorrow would have a much brighter future than he had initially had in his long and storied life. A funeral service will be held this Saturday at Greenie's Park, where his body will be interned in a public grave at 9am. A non-seafood brunch will be provided at the Bayou Motors Company's expense, and the ceremony will be entirely open to the public. We hope to see you there."
