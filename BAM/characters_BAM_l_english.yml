    BAM_CAPTAIN_SHIPBREAKER_NAME:0 "Captain Ship-breaker"
    BAM_CAPTAIN_SHIPBREAKER_DESC:0 "Before a handful of pioneers from out east banded together and set sail to Marsh Island to refurbish the Bayou Motors' old factory-ship there, the Captain lived a lonely life. Hunting down old ships still floating in the water after so many years and dragging them ashore to take them apart for scrap metal is not an easy task—especially since there are not many still working ships from the old world. Pulling them off the seabed with this trusty vessel, the USS Bayview, made him plenty of caps from various salvage operations brought into the nearby Port Cypermort, but after a point, just surviving in this harsh world didn't cut it, and a combination of unfortunate heritage and outright slander rendered him unable to consistently crew his own ship.\n\nThis all changed with the people who settled on Marsh Island—now calling themselves the "Bayou Motors," after the company that originally ran the beached cannery—decided they needed a well-experienced captain to help run their operation and act as the face of their new company and settlement. Someone impartial, someone with charisma, and someone trustworthy. Mr. Ship-breaker wasn't the obvious choice for the job, but given how helpful he'd been in the founding of the young settlement, the good folks in The Cannery decided to give him a chance. Now acting as both Captain and Mayor, he's made sure that his new family has flourished under his watch and that he is unavoidable in their lives—he wouldn't want to lose the wonderful position he just so happened to stumble into, after all."

    BAM_SUSAN_NAME:0 "Susan Langley"
    BAM_SUSAN_DESC:0 "Susan Langley was one of few members of an original group of friends that helped found The Cannery in the first place, using Ship-Breaker's vessel as their main form of transport and housing during the early days. Born in the small town of Cypermort, she never had much to do, but she enjoyed writing and she was good at it. She figured she'd like to go to a big city and become a reporter like the reporters in all the ancient stories she'd been raised reading. When she realized the odds of her making a name for herself in Texas were slim and the odds of her surviving in New Orleans were worse, she fell into a small despair. So when The Cannery got going and started becoming a settlement in its own right separate from Cypermort, co-founding a local newspaper with her husband James seemed like a fun way to kill the time. She became the main reporter of the Bayou Post, and she's been collecting stories to feed The Cannery's readers' curiosity for the last half-century. Now most of her peers have passed on, including her former husband James, and her close friend Ship-Breaker, but she was unanimously chosen by the good people of The Cannery in their first public election to succeed Ship-Breaker in the role of mayor, and she's going to do her best not to disappoint. She's not getting any younger, but Susan knows she has a legacy to carry on."

    BAM_MAIDRUM_NAME:0 "Merlin Maidrum"
    BAM_MERLIN_DESC:0 "Merlin Maidrum has been fishing in the Gulf of Mexico for a very, very long time. He was in New Orleans when the bombs dropped, just pulling out to sea. His boat was damaged, and he suffered radiation sickness, but he survived and was ghoulified, along with every member of his crew. A virtual legend in the fishing communities of the Louisiana coast, Maidrum just happened to be in port at The Cannery when word went out that someone new was needed to head the local occupation council. Merlin wasn't a resident, didn't have family in the city, and didn't even have a business stake in the Bayou Motors company, but what he did have was the prestige of knowing everyone else knew exactly who he was, so he showed up for the nominations and won unanimous local support. Now unsure of exactly what he's gotten himself into but determined to do his best with it, the "Mermaid" is throwing himself into the business of making The Cannery a more respectable port for fishermen across the gulf, free of pirates, free of crime, and with no restrictions on entry whatsoever. Of course, this does mean pirates and criminals can enter, but that's a small price to pay to make sure everyone know The Cannery is quickly becoming the most important naval pit stop west of New Orleans."

    BAM_CLYDE_NAME:0 "Captain Clyde Delarosa"
    BAM_CLYDE_TOKEN:0 "Having lived an unusually long and healthy life for a Caribbean pirate, Captain Clyde recently got mutineed against for suggesting that maybe The Cannery wasn't a worthy target and his ship ought to head back to the Caribbean for more common prey. His comrades dropped him at a port in Mexico with nothing but the clothes on his back. However, they seem to have forgot exactly who they were betraying, and Clyde not only beat his former crew to the quarry, but also signed on with the Bayou Motors Company running The Cannery with the express purpose of thwarting the upcoming heist. Now that Clyde's retirement is secured, he spends most of his time either consulting with the Mayor on matters of local defense or getting absolutely sloshed in Glenn's Bar in the Cannery Port. Of course, this gives him the excuse to lay on any visitors with his mountains of stories, some of which are even true."

    BAM_CHACO_NAME:0 "Chaco Devlop"
    BAM_CHACO_TOKEN:0 "A relatively new arrival to The Cannery compared to most of the other folks running the place, Chaco can generally be summarized as a young bureaucrat-in-training. He runs most of the finances of the Bayou Motors Company while also managing the Mayor's schedule around specific events and meetings. Not many people know his name outside the close circle of friends he's grown to build. Ship-Breaker himself always considered Chaco to be a very reliable individual, though he was never quite sure what Chaco did with what little free time he allowed himself. Don't tell the mayor, but his favorite secretary is also the same person who frequents every kareoke night on the island. Not that he's a bad singer, just that he'd really rather not have his boss show up to one of his casual, scratchy, half-drunken performances."

    BAM_GRANT_NAME:0 "Patrol Lead Grant"
    BAM_GRANT_DESC:0 "Patrol Lead Casey Grant was one of the youngest leads in the Patrolmen before he was given the task of managing the Cannery's operations. Born to a second-generation pioneer couple in the Cannery proper, he decided early on that fishing and factory work weren't for him and he went adventuring inland, just to get caught up in a bandit raid on a Patrolmen base by the Bluff. He was captured, but when he told the patrols who he was and where he was from, they decided to take Casey in and make him one of their own. Since that day he's felt strong loyalties both to his home in The Cannery and to the Gold and Blue that set him down the straight and narrow, and now he's been given the chance to patrol the waves around Marsh Island and make good on his pledge of duty. He might be a bit new to the job, but he's sworn he'll give it his best shot to make his family proud."

    BAM_DIRECTORATE_NAME:0 "The Motors Directorate"
    BAM_DIRECTORATE_DESC:0 "With Ship-Breaker effectively sidelined, the day-to-day running of The Cannery has fallen to the Motors Directorate—the company leaders managing the business of the canning operation itself. There's a few fine men and women on the Directorate, and all of them are locals. Unfortunately for everyone else in The Cannery, profit margins seem to be their only goal with regards to managing the facility, and they've set out on a campaign of cost-cutting to increase productivity across every aspect of the Bayou Motors company. Workplace tragedies are on the rise and safety railings on fishing trawlers are rusting off their bases, but hey, as long as the caps keep flowing, the Directorate is convinced they're doing their job well, and that means everyone under them must clearly be having a better time."
