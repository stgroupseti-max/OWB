  RCK_roach_king_DESC:0 "Locally known as Regi Blattaria to his citizens, the Roach King was saved from the fringes of death by a small group of radroaches who took pity upon his weak and battered state. With their powers combined, they've carved their own territory out amongst their weakened, distracted neighbors in the Northern Commonwealh. Fueled by dreams of grandeur, novelty, and revenge. \n\n It's a harsh world out there, Roach King, how far will your luck be able to take you?"

  RCK_crookston_name:0 "Crookston"
  RCK_crookston_desc:0 "§4"What's our next move, Boss?"§!\n\nOnce a minor member of the Grifton militia, the arrival of the Roach King changed everything. The former captain §Rdisappeared§!, and Crookston was there, ready to fill the gap. Originating from the Badlands, he fled to Grifton to escape the raiders, only to find his new home wasn't all that different. Constantly thinking and keeping a lid on his feelings, Crookston is the perfect lackey for a King."
  RCK_newman_name:0 "Father Newman"
  RCK_newman_desc:0 "§4"Faith gets you farther than anything else, bitches."§! \n\nIn the prior century, the Kingdom of Manitoba's power extended beyond its borders. Funds provided by a wealthy trader in combination with the state church led to the construction of a lovely building in Grafton. Unfortunately, it degenerated into Grifton, and so has the caretaker of the Church. Father Newman has an incredibly checkered past that isn't hard to figure out, with the real question being just how much he actually believes in his faith. What there is no question of is his awareness of how the Roach King can be used to further his own interests of a better lifestyle and having raiders less likely to shoot out yet another window. It remains to be seen who is in charge of who."
