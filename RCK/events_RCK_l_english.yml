  nf_RCK.1.d:0 ""THIS MUTFRUIT IS ROTTEN!" one man shouted.\n\n"The vacuum tube blew up!" Another man said indignantly.\n\n"The Jimmy Hat failed," a pregnant lady muttered defeatedly.\n\nOver and over, the trading post that once screamed wealth to their neighbours found north in Brandon continued to spiral in pain and misery. Grafton had done alright for itself well enough to avoid being targeted in the Great War, but if the inhabitants then could see how their town decayed into Grifton, a hotbed of fools always getting a raw deal, then they may have wished otherwise.\n\nA gunshot rang out, and few cared to pay attention to it- except for Crookston, a member of Grifton's militia. It wouldn't be the first time someone had been ejected from Fischer's bar, and it was not hard to see why as the now wounded, pained man was literally tossed on his ass, followed by a small swarm of radroaches and some more shotgun blast reports. Crookston had his hunting rifle ready, but once realizing that inside Fischer's the various radroaches were gone, he put it down. He could understand shooting the radroaches, but the man was a bit much.\n\n"And stay out!" Fischer shouted, the man responsible for the disturbance falling unconscious with the Radroaches scattering. Stray dogs were getting to work tearing up those who coouldn't escape, in the chaos, the man was left alone. He would certainly die if left here, and wouldn't be the first.\n\nWith the radroaches gone, Crookston sighed. The man was dirty and covered in wounds, lifting him up led to many smaller roaches scurrying out of his clothes, but this wasn't the Badlands. Father Newman owed him a favor for covering up that murder, after all. Crookston didn't notice as people began to stare at him bothering to lend a hand- the militia didn't tend to do that. Then again, maybe it was the radroaches that drew so much attention in the first place."

  nf_RCK.2.t:0 "Preamble of a Takeover"
  nf_RCK.2.d:0 "Outside of Father Newman's Church of Brandon III, a crowd had gathered. At this point, rumours were spreading like wildfire that a magnificent figure with control of an army of radroaches was inside, the actual banal truth having long since been lost in gossip. Newman pushed his single half-spectacle up at the crowd outside, shut the curtain, and turned towards Crookston and the formerly buckshot-laden man, a man who introduced himself as Regi Blattaria.\n\n"I should just toss you out there," Newman said. "This shit isn't worth it."\n\n§B"You owe me, Father,"§! Crookston said with his arms folded. But before yet another arugment broke out, Regi Blattaria sighed. He hated doing this to people. But if it prevented a mess and helped repay the debt he owed the two men, he would, and he'd hope he would never have to do it again.\n\n"Hold on you two, I've got this," Regi exclaimed, causing both men to fall silent, seemingly concerned and what this mysterious man would do. The front of Grifton's militia, just as likely to extort the citizenry for protection with the same odds as taking potshots at raiders from the Badlands, weren't looking back at the Church, only realizing the man responsible for the ruckus had stepped outside upon walking past their idle posts. Regi Blattaria closed his eyes, and began to speak. Suddenly, radroaches which had found their way to the sewers began to ascend and scurry towards him. Alarmingly, the radroaches were regimented, orderly. Never before had simple insects shown this level of coordination before. The irony was not lost on the corrupt and disorganized Grifton militia men watching this event unfold. All fell silent to the words Regi Blattaria would then mutter:"
  nf_RCK.2.a:0 "Regi rallied all behind his radroaches!"
  nf_RCK.2.b:0 "Blattaria spoke of those taken by Vault 37"
  nf_RCK.3.t:0 "Motives & Mandates"
  nf_RCK.3.d:0 "One week later, Crookston, Father Newman, and Regi Blattaria were overlooking the unmarked grave of the former leader of Grifton's militia.\n\n"You're doing a lot here," Regi said. "Not sure how I feel about it."\n\nFather Newman smiled. "What we have here is a chance to make Grifton better than it has ever been. There's a lot that you can do with obedient pests that most hold revulsion towards."\n\n §B"This is being done to remove a threat,"§! Crookston said, crossing his arms. §B"Vault 37's taken people before, and unlike the rest of the Badlands, it's actually on this side of the river. It needs to go, and now we've got a chance."§!\n\n"You know, I just wanted help to get in there," Regi said, looking southwards as the initial group of militia men he had taught to train and feed the Radroaches were taking to it like a duck to water. "I didn't plan on dragging half of Grifton into Vault 37 up in arms, or up your attendance Father, or get you a promotion Crookston- any of this."\n\n§B"Look, as far as I know, it's the best thing you've done,"§! Crookston replied, a frown forming on his face. §B"The way things were going here, we were one bad shootout between the militia and a Badlands gang coming into town to party from this whole "Grifton" expirement collapsing in on itself. We need new management, and this will keep people from looking for... "alternatives"."§!\n\n"Just think of what awaits for you," Father Newman said, still grinning. "Regi Blattaria, King of the Radroaches. You will create something not seen since Gunn, first of his name."\n\nWith that, the three men walked away from the grave, returning to prepare for the conquest of Vault 37. Those robots, and whatever they were doing to people, would come to and end. Liberated, saved, and rescued under the leadership of a new hero descending upon the wasteland: The Roach King."
  nf_RCK.3.a:0 "Thus the Roach King, got his name."
  nf_RCK.4.t:0 "The Hidden Door, Breached"
  nf_RCK.4.d:0 "§B"Dynamite live and ready!"§! Crookston shouted. Father Newman and Roach King were close nearby in an adjacent room, with ear protection firmly secured around their heads. §B"3... 2... 1... LIVE"!§! With this countdown, an enormous explosion breached through the Alluring Door that had captivated Roach King for months. Sending a large shockwave throughout Vault 37, the rattling of walls and flickering of lights alarming the vault's inhabitants still adjusting to their new neighbors, and to their new diets.\n\nOn various maps and blueprints, this room supposedly led to an escape route to the surface- yet no exit was ever found this side of the river. As the explosion turned to smoke. Regi ran inside before the smoke finished clearing, while Father Newman, Crookston, and some men and Radroaches waited for their vision to function first. When Regi's face could be seen, a massive frown grew along it, and his brow furrowed.\n\n"That's it? There's nothing in here!"\n\nIn a fit of rage, the Roach King picked up an empty bottle of Nuka-Cola and hurled it at the wall, shattering it into pieces. Radroaches, as if from nowhere, immediately went to lick up the spill and clean up the broken glass.\n\n §B"There really is nothing? I thought this place was supposed to be packed with supplies or something, Boss. Why is it all gone?... How is it all gone?"§! Crookston was racking his brain for answers, but stopped as Father Newman grinned once more, his presence an uncaring Grim Reaper's sprint.\n\n"I suppose now's a good of time as any." he began. Regi and Crookston turned to look at him, but before either realzied it, a gunshot rang out. With Regi falling to the floor, head spewing blood, as his body began to spasm."
  nf_RCK.4.a:0 "How surprising."
  nf_RCK.5.t:0 "We've been here before"
  nf_RCK.5.d:0 "§B"What the hell are you doing?!"§! Crookston cried out, Father Newman then aimed his 9mm pistol to Crookston's chest. "Crookston, lsiten to me, i hope you know what I had to do here. It was a necessesity, He... he was too dangerous to be given this much power, he's unstable. I had to do this! I had to-"\n\nFather Newman would never finish his monologue, Father Newman's monstrous betrayel soon attracted the fury of the few radroaches in the immediate proximity. One by one they began to pounce, there was no way Father Newman would ever stand a chance. The screams would start, and then end, as the radroaches saw to his demise. Crookston took the opportunity to run to the Roach King's side, injecting a stimpak he had on standby for emergencies like this. This isn't the first time he's found Roach King in such a state, and this time, he's prepared.\n\n When the radroaches finished their slaughter, the enraged insects turned to Crookston, an awkard silence ensued. Crookston was holding the Roach King's unconscious head, he seemed to have taken a bullet to the head quite well. With Crookston's stimpak seeming to quickly be taking effect. §B"Uhhh, easy there, buddies..." Crookston was nervous, as the growing swarm of radroaches descended upon him. Yet, too his surprise, they would never attack. They approached Crookston in curiousity, and seemed to understand that he had saved their master's life. §B"What the hell did I get myself into man."§! was all Crookston could mutter, as he waited for Roach King to regain conciousness."

  vault_war.1.d:0 "Regi Blattaria has mustered all possible force Grifton could offer. Above the horizon of a gray cloudy day stood the ruins of Grand Forks- spires of brick and concrete, slabs of wall hiding the dangers.\n\nCrookston's eyes narrowed. Throughout the streets he could spot through his binoculars, Vault-Tec Security Robots moved with a refined efficiency. Nothing of value remained- anyone alive had long since been taken into the ever expanding Vault. Rumor is it goes down for miles.\n\nCrookston noticed how agitated and distracted Regi Blattaria was as he returned to the command tent, guarded by patrolling radroaches. Father Newman was within, arguing about how the roaches could form a shield wall to protect the ever limited militia men present. Regi was in disagreement, and the two were going back and forth on "value of life". Truly a conversation fit for the intellectual minds of the old world. Crookston could only rub his temples; was now really the time to walk back and rethink their strategy, so close to the Vault? Or should he step in and set these two bickering fools straight before they get themselves killed."

And an old timer seems to be coordinating messages and tactics between the two. The Overseer does not think these visitors are friendly.

Roach King's once enormous radroach army has scattered, unable to find their king. Deep in the city center, a growing mob has surrounded Roach King's estate, demanding his head for this nightmare he's brought to their home. Father Newman is at the head of this riot, galvanzing the militia to defeat the radroaches defending the idly waiting Roach King. Crookston is nowhere to be seen, presumedly fallen in battle. There seems to be only one logical solution."

Father Newman had a speech prepared to read out to the now liberated vault dwellers. But upon seeing the distorted, round shapes these vault dwellers now seemed to posses, Father Newman's speech on sacrifice, humility, and temperance, seemed a tad innapropiate given the circumstances."

Brother Jan has already begun to move forward, getting close enough to properly line up a clean shot. Is there no better way to keep our vault dwellers safe then to remove the source of the problem? One bullet aimed at the one directing radroaches should be enough to throw their entire army into disarray! We'll be able to walk right into Grifton, and welcome in our new residents."

A great meeting of the minds was had. A brilliant strategy developed as a way to circumvent a losing war against the much better armed Vault Tec Security team. As the meeting came to a close, an unexpected shot rang out. At first the men and roaches turned to face the direction in which it came from. South, from Vault 37. From the very tips of their eyes. They could see one man standing in the distance, laughing maniacly, dressed in armor to resmeble a knight! As the generals turned to face the Roach King, their hearts sank in fear. The Roach King was dead. slumped over, lifeless and cold."

She stands at 160 centimeters, is of fair skin, with my diagnostics suspecting she is in her early 30's. Radiation testing reads negative, she is fit for integration into the expirement. She was cold and confused upon entering the vault. And refused to participate in our Vault's Lifestyle. Exactly 13 minutes and 34 seconds after she was rescued, she attempted escape, damaging one of our Vault Security Robots, and injuring herself in the process. She has been placed into a medical ward for a standard treatment and is expected to make a swift recovery. And given plenty of different sweets to enjoy, beverages to drink, and movies to watch while she recovers.

  RCK_hidden_holotape.2.d:0 ""Regi! I found something!" a woman shouted, peaking her head above the overgrown vegitation encompassing a centuries worth of abandoned North Dakotan wheat fields. "It's a robot! We can scrap it for parts!" The woman shouted excitedly. "Nice, wait up for me!" Regi responded, jogging over to her direction, "Woah! It's practically brand new. How long has this been out here for?" Regi asked, analyzing the fallen droid. "I don't know. It says here it's property of a vault! Vault 37 to be exact! Those lucky jerks. I heard it was mostly the elites and military who got to be selected for them." Sirius began rambling about the ethics of vault selection and unfair standards of a pre war United States. "Yep, I hear you." Regi responded while unscrewing the chestplate of the Robot.  "Huh, that's funny. There's just a dislodged wire, if i put it back into place it should just..." Without thinking, Regi reconnected the dislodged wire of the decaying security robot. As soon as he did, the robot sprung to life, knocking back both Sirius and Regi. "WARNING. WARNING. AREA IS UNDER THREAT. RETREAT IMMINENT." The robot screached from its speaker. As it turned to flee. It saw a helpless Sirius on the ground. "VAULT DWELLER IN DANGER, RETREATING NOW" After blaring this sound, it scooped up Sirius who attempted to break free. But was unable to. "Regi! Help!" "Let her go you bastard!" Regi yelled, unholstering his laser pistol before firing 3 shots into the security robot. "SHOTS FIRED, SHOTS FIRED. PACIFYING THREAT" Before Regi realized, the robot had turned around, firing a direct shot into Regi's chest. Blasting him off his feet. before crying out in pain. "Regi! No!- Let me go!" Sirius cried out, doing her best to break free. The robot did not listen. instead turning to retreat back to its vault. Regi attempted to stand but collapsed from the searing pain. "I'm.. I'm going to save you." was all he could mutter as the robot fled with Sirius in hand."

  RCK_hidden_holotape.3.d:0 ""I'll... save you... I'll... save you..." Regi dragged his wounded body in the direction the security robot took Sirius in, South East. The landscape was filled with overgrown vegetation. Following nuclear annihilation, dozens of abandoned farmsteads allowed their crops to overrun the landscape. Much to the dismay of Regi. his body was aching with searing pain, the laser shot which blasted a hole through his chest was thankfully non fatal, as it had cauterized itself instantly from the intense heat. Regi continued to drag his weak body for what felt like hours. Until finally. His strength gave out. Realizing he was at his limit. he leaned himself against a nearby tractor to stare into the night sky. The stars had always captivated him. He had learned from various books the names of constellations. surrounding him was a short stream, whose idle noise was a pleasant distraction from the intense pain, he could hear the swaying of leaves in the trees, "I'm... I'm okay with this. I'm sorry Sirius, be strong. Stronger than me." Saying this, he let his body go limp, and prepared to die. Giving one last look at his surroundings before his conciousness gave out, the river, whose idle noise recreated a feeling of peace and tranquility, the trees, whose swaying leaves brought the feeling of nature, and comfort. The stars, whose patterns and symbolism captivated him for eternity. And finally, a Radroach, who was slowly crawling his way towards Regi. "Huh?" Regi said, confused at the sight before him, believing himself to be delirious from exhaustion. In front of him was a Radroach, although it had a damaged eye, it had a faint, golden hue, illuminating the cold North Dakotan landscape in a short perimeter. In its mouth, it held a stimpak, which it dropped in front of the wounded, rapidly deteriorating Regi. "I... Don't understand... why...?" Regi said in a confused state, soon noticing more radroaches approaching him, one held an unopened bottle of nukacola, one held a wildly grown Tato plant, before long, Regi was back on his feet. Weak, wounded, delirious, but alive. And filled with a new wave of adrenaline. He soon continued his hike, and as he continued, more radroaches began trailing him on his journey. Encapsulated by the sight of a strange man, in a strange mask, walking in rags. "I think.. It's time for a change of strategy." Changing his direction north, Regi Blattaria, The Radroach Tamer, began marching with his Radroaches, to a small town north of Grand Forks."

Evidence of automation and promotion of a useless, subservient population plastered the walls and ceilings in the form of rail tracks and propaganda posters. "I swear there was a book named after this." Roach King said as he walked by a poster depicting overseer THOMAS with a large central eye, watching over the vault dwellers. "Sir!" a man shouted while running towards the Roach King, beside him were two roaches, who flew alongside the man. "Roach King! Sir! we have a problem. One of the vault dwellers is refusing to vacate. She seems different. She's not like the rest." As the man explained the situation. The Roach King's eyes widened. Before the man had finished his rambling, the Roach King had broken out into a full sprint. Dashing through each hall, he passed by confused vault dwellers, Grifton Militia men, and plenty of roaches. Many of which turned and began following the roach king as he sprinted through the halls. As he delved deeper into the vault. He finally overheard the source of the conundrum. He overheard the angered yells of a woman who had barricaded herself in her room. §P"I'm not going with you! I'd rather die than be your slave!"§! her anguished cries confused many of the Grifton militia men, unsure of how to handle the situation. As the roach king reached the exterior of the room.

"Oh... okay then! You got this Mr Roach King!" the militia man happily exclaimed his approval as he left to patrol the vault. §P"What?.. Hello?"§! the woman asked from the other side of the door. "Sirius... It's me." Regi said softly, staring forward at the door. Silence came from the other side. Each passing second feeling like an hour. Until finally, the door opened. Revealing A disheveled, dirty, but otherwise unharmed Sirius. "Ri-Regi?" Sirius asked, tears already beginning to form. "Yes, it's me. I'm here now." Regi responded. Before long, the two embraced.

Yet your roaches burrowed in through Vault 37's Air purification system. where my people and my circuits were exposed. For their own safety, I chose to open the doors.

But now, I have one question that you know the answer to."§! The Roach King responded before finishing his circling of Overseer THOMAS. "I've checked your resident logs. We've accounted for everyone. But someone is missing. Where is she, robot?§!" He asked sternly. Staring into the assortment of metalic plating and dim, red lighting of the machine. §R"I could not answer. The safety of my citizens is my upmost concern. And given your... hostile demeanor, my programming forbids me from giving you her location."§! The Overseer responded with a dullish, straightforward, robotic answer. "Heh, okay then... maybe I'll have to get this information some other way." the Roach King laughed, Cracking his knuckles before taking a large, powerful swing into the Overseer's exposed power source. *BANG* "AGHHH MY.

Upon reaching the wall, he ripped out of a loose, rusted over metalic pipe from the wall. upon doing so, a small stream of water began to drip from the remaining pipes. §R"Your anger and emotional outbursts entertain me. I know precisely where this person you seek out is located. I have her heat signatures, I have a blood sample, I have her name. I have her height and weight. Do you even know her blood type? It's O-, a remarkable discovery. I know everything there is to know."§! The Overseer was being relentless, making a mockery of the Roach King's helplessness. "I said. That's ENOUGH!" Roach King shouted back, swinging the metalic pipe into the machine with his one good hand. The Overseer fell, with sparks beginning to fly, and the sound of damaged wiring and leaking coolant spilling onto the ground. The Roach King continued the assault. Beating and smashing the pipe repeatably into the metallic being. Every swing causing the robotic entity to crumble further and further into a pile of machinery, with its last bout of power, before the Roach King could land the killing blow.

"Now now, there's no reason to be upset. You didn't do anything wrong. You fought valiently in the field of battle. I believe your leadership in battle surpasses that of my own. Look, the situation I find myself is rather perilous. I feel I am in need of your strength and courage on the battlefield. I offer you this, in exchange for you freedom, citizenship and religious tolerance for your people. Will you join me in my conquests and mission? And serve as head of my army?" Brother Jan was stunned, such humility and openness was the last thing he expected from this interaction. Soon though, a smile began to creep along his face. "But of course. I would be a fool to refuse such an offer. As a token of my gratitude, I offer you my most prized military possesion, my personal set of power armor. It's special to Manitoba! There isn't another one like it south of the border! You'll surely shine like a star! It sits behind me, I implore you to try it for yourself, the fusion core is fresh from the battle." Flattered, the Roach King walked past Jan to the power armor, it was as prestigious as described, when he reached the latch to unlock the suit for entry. A strange sound occured.

The Roach King, who was nearing the open door, was blown out of the room, engulfed in flames. Crashing headfirst into a wall in the hallway, the abrupt explosion attracted the attention of everyone inside the Vault, who quickly came to the Roach King's aid. As his mind began to slip, and his vision grew, darker, and darker, the ringing in his ears began to fade away, with the sounds of voices returning.

The Kingdom of Manitoba has always viewed Roach King's "Monarchy" as an insult to their way of life.

"§BLike, sure he's kinda glowing a bit, but why that one specifically. Why is he your "right hand"?§!"\n\n "There's a lot you don't know about me Crookston. A lot. The Roach King than took a moment to watch Sergeant Roach overrun human defenders in a mock battle. "That radroach right there is very special to me. If something were to happen to me, I know he would be uncontrollable. Which reminds me, Crookston, have you received your copy of the plan? In case I were to meet an untimely fate?" "§BI uh, have boss. And look, I'm flattered. But.. these radroaches. They don't follow me like they follow you. What the hell am I supposed to do? Wave your head around on a stick?"§! "Ghoulish remark aside, yes. "Project Puppet" is to be initiated by you, and only you. I trust you Crooskton. You're one of only two people I know who could make this work. "§BI see... Boss, I'm honored. But man, for my own sake. I really, really, hope it never comes down to it. How are the meds? are they working at least? How's your mind been? Are you still... hearing things?§!"\n\n "There's good days and bad days. Even days and odd. I know not how much time my mind had left. But my body... my body has proven to be quite enduring. I am the most enduring man in the wasteland after all. But that's not important for now. We're still knee deep in the middle of campaigning season."

Crookston was impressed by the countless constellations visible without the overwhelming pre-war light pollution to spoil the fun. While teams of Vault 37 volunteers, radroaches, and local volunteers slept in tents, waiting for the next day to continue the road network. "§B Woah, wait what's that one, I think that's uhh, what's the red planet?"§! "That would be Mars, Crookston." Roach King muttered "And to its right. Orion's Belt." "§BNice, and what's that one below it?§!" "That. That... That would be Canis Majoris. And Crookston, you see that star? The bright one?" "§BYeah of course, how could I miss it?§!" "That star's name, is §PSirius§!. It's the brightest star in the night sky." "§BBoss, how the hell did you get so good at knowing what's going on up there? They're dots man...§!" \n\n "That...

I have an eye for talent, and whether or not you want to admit it or not. You have talent. I've seen the communities your land contains. They're pristine, an artform. I would love to recruit you to my inner circle. Trust me this is good news for you! My radroaches are great allies to have! There'd be no more need for a human militia! You can focus on your true talent: Administration, without bother, or much oversight. Won't you join us?" The Roach King pleaded, an unusual sight for a conquering warrior. "§2What a fascinating man you are... do you not have any honor? How would your reputation survive being known as the King who begs before the conquered?§!" The Masquerade was puzzled, and intrigued. "Oh, I suppose it'd be embarassing sure. But at the end of the day. I'm the one with the radroaches. If it triggers a revolt, so be it. My radroaches don't care what others think of me. They're loyal to me." "§2Fascinating... this lack of shame... this lack of... awareness. It's like a dance. I accept these conditions... I'm most fascinated by the intricacies of such an unusual government. And I'm curious as to when the mask will slip eventually. How far can your radroaches take you, Roach King? How far before you meet your match? How far before your luck finally runs out?§!" "I have no idea, they've gotten me this far haven't they? There's still plenty of obstacles ahead. I'm just glad to have you on our side. Welcome aboard. Mr. Masquerade" "§2Please... Call me... The Jester...

Sister Rose was angered, and did not seem amused by the Roach King's hospitality. "§BActually, uh yeah, a bomb did go off here, the boss almost died from it and everything.§!" Crookston replied.\n\n "Yes, It's true. My time almost came to an end here. I felt myself slipping to the other side. But something, something pulled me back. Now then, Sister Rose, of the Children of Atom. I know about your religion, and your worry of the Second Deluge. I don't discount this worry. It's an appropriate fear. We invaded your land not out of a disdain or desire to bring about a second deluge. Actually quite the contrary. We want to recruit you and your siblings as Children of Atom into the growing Radroach Empire, well, not quite an empire yet. Long term goal. Really, all we invaded for was to demand control of your foreign policy and taxation in exchange for the personal assistance of my radroaches. Really this is a win-win. I get resources and an expansion of my domain, and you can utilize my radroaches in ensuring the Second Deluge can never become a reality. I would also throw in a concession that I'll allow religious sites of the Children of Atom to remain untaxed and inaccessible to radroaches. To ensure your people's autonomy and personal liberty.

He's basically got a live mini nuke strapped to him at all times with his radroach army.

It's helped substantially. I'm unsure what I would be without them. But we're reaching a crossroads. My mind is faltering, my true goal hasn't been found and it eats at my mind every moment. And that DAMN door is still unopened, What has taken so long?!" The Roach King sighed and leaned back in his chair, continuing his rant. "I've begun seeing and hearing things Crookston. I worry I soon won't be presentable. It's becoming... difficult to continue on like this. Project Puppet may need to be initiated at this rate." "§BNo! No way boss.

"I appreciate your loyalty Crookston, that's why I entrust you to carry out Project Puppet when the time is ready. For now. We need to get ourselves ready for Project Puppet to go into effect. Our borders Crookston, update me on our borders." \n\n"§BWell, same old same old. And word travels slow by radroach. There's a strong tribe to our west, literal tribe too, old school natives. There's been skirmishes at the border from wandering radroaches. But, if we push them to the river... We should be golden... To the South... Plagues, probably best we don't get involved, but if we really have to, your personal leadership would be needed, I wouldn't risk sending milita men in there. It's just too dangerous. There's a tribe of Ghouls that guard the entrance. Haven't checked in on them recently since the border is quiet. But if they're still there, we could strong arm them to make sure they keep whatever's there... there. And the North... Well, we're both sitting here, so clearly we're fine for now.
