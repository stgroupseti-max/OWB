   rck_roach_war:0 "Roach Disposal"
  rck_roach_war_desc:0 "The history of the Roach King does not begin in Grifton. Does not begin with Father Newman. It certainly didn't begin with Crookston. That last person, however, is a good place to start."
  rck_hero_of_roach:0 "The King's Speech"
  rck_hero_of_roach_desc:0 "It took some time for the Roach King to awaken, and in that time, word spread of a man who could convert the Wasteland's least-liked pests into something much more approachable. An ambition which was not entirely appreciated by Father Newman at first."
  RCK_the_roach_to_victory:0 "The Roach to Victory"
  RCK_the_roach_to_victory_desc:0 "Grifton had problems before the coming of Roach King. His arrival has acted as a catalyst for either something very good, or very problematic to this rag tag community."
  rck_roach_king_the_brave:0 "Roach King the Brave"
  rck_roach_king_the_brave_desc:0 "The Roach King is a man filled with bravery and courage. So says Father Newman, proselytizing what it takes to redeem and make good the unclean."
  RCK_roach_king_the_wise:0 "Roach King the Wise"
  RCK_roach_king_the_wise_desc:0 "The Roach King does not have the highest intelligence in the wasteland. Crookston, however, knows some people in Grifton who could put ideas together. Combining the brightest minds in Grifton may lead to a nasty surprise in level of expertise, but enough of it has to be legit to help."
  RCK_leading_the_people:0 "Leading Grifton"
  RCK_leading_the_people_desc:0 "The people of Grifton are caught up in Roach King mania, but it surely will not last forever. Putting some people to work in something not farming or passing off junk as treasure will create a large group of folks that will keep their loyalty to the Roach King when the populace cools to his sight."
  RCK_leading_the_roaches:0 "Leading Radroaches"
  RCK_leading_the_roaches_desc:0 "The radroaches obey the Roach King, but their obedience also allows proxies to delegate. More people will need to be trained to handle daily interaction with these remarkable creatures. Less we put all our eggs into one Roach King shaped basket."
  RCK_its_a_start:0 "Triumph of Grifton"
  RCK_its_a_start_desc:0 "Grifton has shown great loyalty and subservience to the Roach King, a triumph of Roach King's strength and receptive ideals of safety and prosperity shall be displayed. No more rag tag radroach swarms. The time of organized Radroach Patrols is here!"
  RCK_among_a_roach:0 "Question of Loyalty"
  RCK_among_a_roach_desc:0 "To lead a radroach to greatness requires great bravery and courage. With enough trust, they'll gladly sacrifice themselves for the Roach King. As the Roach King would do for them. We're still a bit away from unquestioned loyalty, however."
  RCK_water_wells:0 "Ruins and Water Wells"
  RCK_water_wells_desc:0 "Grifton is positioned close by to a large, seemingly endless river. This position is perfect for providing clean drinking water to the Roach King's growing radroach army."
  RCK_salvage_scraps:0 "Salvage Scrap"
  RCK_salvage_scraps_desc:0 "Many wonder how the Wasteland can produce metal tools. There's quite the abundance of scrap metal lying around from 200 years of degradation brought on by an event similar to mass extinction. While not the most efficient tools, Father Newman claims that the resulting cleaning of the streets will make the King more popular with the settlements outlying Grifton."
  RCK_a_worthy_leader:0 "A Worthy King"
  RCK_a_worthy_leader_desc:0 "The Roach King has proven he's willing to work hard for the community of Grifton. With great sacrifice and privledges thrown their way. The people of Grifton have shown rare loyalty in the wasteland for his cause."
  RCK_fight_the_power:0 "Fight the Power!"

  RCK_to_the_capital_wasteland_desc:0 "§gBroken, Battered, Wounded. The Roach King has no home. No allies, no respect. There's nothing left to do but flee, and rebuild. A departure east seems most fitting. Let us see where he ends up.§!"
  RCK_vault_war:0 "§YVault War§!"
  RCK_vault_war_desc:0 "The Roach King's first conquest lies to the south. Grifton is fine... okay, it sucks, but nowhere in the Wasteland holds the same value as a Vault. A Vault that has been kidnapping people for as long as can be remembered? That value is priceless."
  RCK_roach_burrows:0 "Roach Burrows"
  RCK_roach_burrows_desc:0 "A radroach doesn't need a warm home or loving family. Any hole in the ground is good enough to suffice. Perhaps some well prepared Roach Nests can boost our number of radroaches in the army?"
  RCK_grafton_army_depot:0 "Grifton Army Depot"
  RCK_grafton_army_depot_desc:0 "Grifton has deteriorated into a collection of hamlets and outposts since the days of prewar Grafton. But there's still a thriving marketplace. We can aquire some weapons to pierce a robotic army!"
  RCK_vault_cracking:0 "§MThe Legend Begins§!"
  RCK_vault_cracking_desc:0 "With Vault 37 breached, the Roach King has an empire within his reach. With the AI overseer deactivated, and the false knight deposed, the people need a new ruler. Within this chaos, a legend begins. \n §MThe Legend of Roach King§!"
  RCK_shatter_vault_tech_security:0 "Shatter Vault Tec Security"
  RCK_shatter_vault_tech_security_desc:0 "An army of robots keeping its population hostage. Quite dystopian. If we're to be seen as liberators, let's dispose of these boogeymen, roaches are much easier to handle... Let's keep the schematics though. Just in case!"
  RCK_treasure_trove:0 "Treasure Trove"
  RCK_treasure_trove_desc:0 "Any vault untouched by nuclear fire is a treasure trove of riches. Vault 37 has many resources, treasures, and holotapes lying around. Deactivated robots litter the halls, surely something here has to be useful, right? Let's look around."
  RCK_cleaning_up_the_scraps:0 "Your Liberator! Your hero!"
  RCK_cleaning_up_the_scraps_desc:0 "Vault 37's dwellers are a bunch of large beach balls that refuse to understand the outside world. According to Father Newman, it's our duty to bring them in line and understand what awaits, no matter how difficult it gets. Crookston was concerned, but ultimately, the Roach King decided that tough love would do."
  RCK_roaches_expansion:0 "Overseer Roach King"
  RCK_roaches_expansion_desc:0 "My friends, subjects, radroaches. I won't hurt any of you! I am the hero of this story! I've come to save you all from this tyranny! All you have to do is listen to me."
  RCK_building_a_throne:0 "Throne For A King"
  RCK_building_a_throne_desc:0 "The Roach King has had one goal since his proclamation of being the king of radroaches. But a throne, a throne to sit on and watch over his subjects? That suits him nicely."
  RCK_great_roach_forward:0 "Great Roach Forward"
  RCK_great_roach_forward_desc:0 "We're on the up and up! No longer is Roach King confined to a small pocket of the Northern Commonwealth, why, he may rise to rule over the entire north! The time of the radroach is here!"
  RCK_northern_roaches:0 "Northern Roaches"
  RCK_northern_roaches_desc:0 "The Roach King's empire lays on the outskirts of a mighty winter. Up north is far too cold for a roach to survive. Even within the walls of Grifton, it's not uncommon to see roaches shrivel up and freeze. If the Roach King wants to expand into the snow, He must use other forces."
  RCK_assimilate_the_vault_dwellers:0 "Assimilate Vault Dwellers"
  RCK_assimilate_the_vault_dwellers_desc:0 "We've been given the unique situation of having the most unskilled workforce in the entire wasteland. These people can't even paint a wall without having to sit down for ten minutes. On the bright side, integration should be extremely easy as they're grateful to have any job at all. We just have to keep them away from the Vault's food sources for a long, long time."
  RCK_church_crashing:0 "Silo Crashing"
  RCK_church_crashing_desc:0 "These guys are a ticking time bomb, literally! Look at what they're sitting on top of. It's not neighborly, but these guys need to be brought under control before their leader does something desperate and reckless."
  RCK_hivemind_of_roach:0 "Hivemind of Roach"
  RCK_hivemind_of_roach_desc:0 "The hivemind of roach is an anomaly in nature. These roaches huddle, eat, and fight together. Truly useful in organizing an attack on the enemy."
  RCK_winter_warfare:0 "Winter Warfare"
  RCK_winter_warfare_desc:0 "Winter warfare is unnatural to roaches. It is incredibly damaging but mandatory for anyone who plans on surviving in the great white north."
  RCK_raiders_to_our_north:0 "Careful, It's Cold Up There"
  RCK_raiders_to_our_north_desc:0 "War, terror, and hegemony, that's the only result of heading north. It's a foolish gambit. Let them destroy each other. And if they come knocking, well. We'll be ready."
  RCK_all_roads_lead_to_roach_king:0 "All Roads Lead To Roach King"
  RCK_all_roads_lead_to_roach_king_desc:0 "The Roach King's realm is transitioning from a pile of trash inproperly placed in the wrong receptacle to a bastion in the north. All roads lead to Roach King, as long as we heed Father Newman's predictions."
  RCK_welcome_home:0 "Welcome Home"
  RCK_welcome_home_desc:0 "We have no reason to harm the citizens of the Church. Crashing the Church was primarily metaphorical - a simple change in management, one might say."
  RCK_the_churches_teachings:0 "The Silo's Teachings"
  RCK_the_churches_teachings_desc:0 "The Children of Atom posses extensive knowledge of warfare and radiation. A perfect combination for the rad-resistant radroaches. We could surely use the training."
  RCK_use_your_wings:0 "Use Your Wings"
  RCK_use_your_wings_desc:0 "The Roach King wonders what it would be like to glide in the sky. To fly amongst his roaches into battle. Well, with a little backyard brewery. We can make this dream a possibility. The King will fly with his radroaches!"
  RCK_breed_more_roaches:0 "Life Finds a Way"
  RCK_breed_more_roaches_desc:0 "The Roach Nests we invested into years ago is proving to be deeply effective in creating new radroaches for Roach King's army. It seems no matter where, and under what conditions. Life always finds a way."
  RCK_two_people:0 "Divide and Conquer"
  RCK_two_people_desc:0 "The two peoples posses land along two sides of a great river. They seem divided by internal tribal politics, heh, fools. They're ripe for the picking!"
  RCK_prospering_roaches:0 "Prospering Roaches"
  RCK_prospering_roaches_desc:0 "Our new citizens are under the protection of an army of Radroaches. This has allowed the development of specializations. A Radroach does not want caps! Our army is cheap and efficient, allowing the people's lives to improve more than if they had to handle their own defense."
  RCK_expanding_vault_37:0 "Expanding Vault 37"
  RCK_expanding_vault_37_desc:0 "Vault 37 is not exactly the most spacious Vault, even if one discounts how much space the residents take up. Documents from the previous Overseer suggests they planned on using Vault-Tec Protectrons to excavate a new set of rooms and hallways to the west. This plan's still ready to go."
  RCK_tools_of_the_trade:0 "Tools of The Trade"
  RCK_tools_of_the_trade_desc:0 "Vault 37 is home to a rather robust amount of industrial equipment. Crookston's been harping on about making copies, and he's probably right as to why we should."
  RCK_vault_tech_scientists:0 "Vault-Tec Scientists"
  RCK_vault_tech_scientists_desc:0 "The Vault-Tec Scientists that remained after the Vault War are quite grateful. Going from one iron fisted ruler to another on paper would be hell. But for these scientists, it was a liberation, the lack of corn dogs aside. On another note, Crookston is quiet about what goes into a corndog."
  RCK_salvage_salvage_salvage:0 "Overseer Tato Battery"
  RCK_salvage_salvage_salvage_desc:0 "With the Overseer unplugged, the Roach King has ordered the Vault-Tec scientists to recycle it into a science experiment for the Vault's children. One child has managed to wire it up to a §YTato Plant§! and has managed to create an electricty source! Well done child!"
  RCK_vault_tec_secrets:0 "Vault-Tec Secrets"
  RCK_vault_tec_secrets_desc:0 "Vault-Tec is no angel service. That much is evident from the stories the Roach King was told as a child. What they do possess is a great library of experimental data and thousands of lines of computer code taken directly from the overseer himself. Perhaps we can recycle some?"
  RCK_revitalize_the_vault:0 "Revitalize The Vault"
  RCK_revitalize_the_vault_desc:0 "Vault 37 was designed to be a paradise. Robotic manufacturing litters the Vault, along with the creation of a horrible way to live. Let us show the residents of Vault 37 how the world really functions."
  RCK_crown_jewel:0 "Crown Jewel"
  RCK_crown_jewel_desc:0 "Finally, the Roach King has his throne. Sitting in the Overseer's office, the Roach King orders man and roach with a large smile. The people love him. The roaches worship him. Finally, he's been accepted as the ruler Father Newman always knew he could be."
  RCK_cold_acclimization:0 "Cold Acclimatization"
  RCK_cold_acclimization_desc:0 "Roaches were not bred for the cold. But even still. They've managed to thrive in the endless winter of the North. They seem to be acclimizing themselves well to the cold. Interesting."
  RCK_clear_pathway:0 "Approach With Caution"
  RCK_clear_pathway_desc:0 "It's dangerous up north. We are vulnerable to any attack at any time. Perhaps we could use this to our advantage? Regardless. We need to play defensive. There's only so many radroaches this far north."
  RCK_a_fellow_kingdom:0 "An Uncomfortable Arrangement"
  RCK_a_fellow_kingdom_desc:0 "It's a nervewracking feeling. The feeling of anxiety. The Roach King knows conflict up north is inevitable. The Three Rivers declared as such from their vehement opposition to the 2274 Grifton-Roach King treaty. Let's prepare, now."
  RCK_a_fellow_kingdom_desc:0 "It's a nervewracking feeling. The feeling of anxiety. The Roach King knows conflict up north is inevitable. The Three Rivers declared as such from their vehement opposition to the 2274 Grifton-Roach King treaty. Let's prepare, now."
  RCK_dramathat:0 "Don't be Dramatic"
  RCK_dramathat_desc:0 "A strange people, actors and theatrics, a most refined and alien culture. They seem incomprehensible to understand at first glance. One must wonder what is going on within their walls. We must learn!"
  RCK_roach_war_games:0 "War Game: Roach Sprawl"
  RCK_roach_war_games_desc:0 "A Roach Sprawl! A truly fascinating concept! Hypothetically, without the Roach King's presence, the radroaches who are ever so loyal to Roach King would lose their minds! They would revert to their uncontrolled animalistic nature, and sprawl out to conquer and devour as much as they can. While this should be prevented, it wouldn't hurt to learn a little."
  RCK_revitalize_roaches:0 "Revitalize The Roaches"
  RCK_revitalize_roaches_desc:0 "Our roaches are growing more independent of their handlers. This is very, very bad. Perhaps a visit from the Roach King will steer them back in the right direction."
  RCK_vault_dweller_recruitment:0 "Renounce the Treaty"
  RCK_vault_dweller_recruitment_desc:0 "The Roach King's conquests have brought wealth and prosperity to the city of Grifton, more importantly, the Roach King no longer uses the small town as his base of operations, making the previous treaty largely irrelevant and no longer needed."
  RCK_vault_dweller_recruitment_desc:0 "The Roach King's conquests have brought wealth and prosperity to the city of Grifton, more importantly, the Roach King no longer uses the small town as his base of operations, making the previous treaty largely irrelevant and no longer needed."

  RCK_one_big_sour_apple_desc:0 "Before Roach King, Grifton was a close ally of the Republic of Three Rivers, as a result of their treachary, no amounts of diplomacy can repair the damaged relations between our two nations.
