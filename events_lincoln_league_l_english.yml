  nf_lincoln_league.1.d:0 "After the defeat of the mutants in the south, our sister city renamed itself and started organising some kind of alliance. A league between independent cities with the usual political garbage - promoting trade, mutual defence pacts, cultural exchanges, etcetera, etcetera. The situation turns only interesting when they mention their plan for "coordinated foreign policy", or simply put, our annexation. While there are certainly benefits of being under one government, we do not want to give up our freedom. On the other hand, they are very determined about the merger, and if we refuse their offer, we'll find ourselves at war with our only ally in this wasteland."
  nf_lincoln_league.1.a:0 "Not like we would have another choice."
  nf_lincoln_league.1.b:0 "We will not get pushed around!"

  nf_lincoln_league.2.t:0 "Good News"
  nf_lincoln_league.2.d:0 "The messenger came back from our sister city - and they agreed to our terms! The League are already expanding - with this pace, we'll rival the TEU or even the NCR in no time!"
  nf_lincoln_league.2.a:0 "We really needed that."

  nf_lincoln_league.3.t:0 "Don't Kill the Messenger"
  nf_lincoln_league.3.d:0 "The messenger came back from our sister city - and they refused our generous offer! This deeply saddens us, as they were good neighbours to us. Whelp, we tried. Let's mobilize the troops, General. We're going to war - again."
  nf_lincoln_league.3.a:0 "Issue the order for offensive!"
