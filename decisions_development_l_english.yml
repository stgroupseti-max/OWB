  development_project_rancho_seco_npp_wtt:0 "Restore the Rancho Seco NGS"
  development_project_rancho_seco_npp_wtt_desc:0 "First conceptualized in the 1960s, the Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station was planned to be a major source of power for various counties in California, but was hastily shut down after nuclear disaster proved to be a risk. The station's construction, as well as the measures taken to secure it after its decommission, would make it difficult to restore, though the benefits of doing so would be great.\n"
  development_project_storm_creek_national_military_museum_npp_wtt:0 "Restore the Storm Creek National Military Museum"
  development_project_storm_creek_national_military_museum_npp_wtt_desc:0 "The Storm Creek National Military Museum was a grand project undertaken during the height of American militarism, partly funded by a substantial loan from the Alton Bourghess Mining Concern. It was meant to serve as both a repository of the nation’s proud martial heritage and a propaganda tool to glorify the pre-war military-industrial complex. Its location in the windswept valleys of Storm Creek made it both scenic and secure, nestled among jagged cliffs and ancient forests.\n\nInside its walls were countless treasures: pristine examples of T-51b power armor, schematics for long-abandoned weapon systems, and artifacts from pivotal conflicts stretching back to the nation's founding.\n\nFollowing the Great War, the museum remained eerily intact, protected by its advanced security systems. Automated turrets, Sentry Bots, and Assaultrons were programmed to defend the vault and its contents from looters. Over the decades, these defenses have continued their eternal patrol, unyielding in their directive to safeguard what remains of America’s bygone glory. The few scavengers bold enough to explore the museum often speak of the gleaming eyes of robots watching from the shadows, and some never return at all."
  development_project_san_onofre_npp_wtt_desc:0 "Restore the SONGS"
  development_project_san_onofre_npp_wtt:0 "Restore the SONGS"
  development_project_san_onofre_npp_wtt_desc:0 "The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, shortened as SONGS, was both a testament to America's ambition, and an embarrassment for all those involved. Though grandiose in appearance and conception, the station's construction is pockmarked with various signs of inelegance and cut corners. Among these are winding pipes that lead to seemingly nowhere, reactors installed improperly or even backwards, and the occasional leak of toxic material. All the same, the station may be of use to us.\n"
  development_project_diablo_canyon_npp_wtt:0 "Restore the Diablo Canyon Power Plant"
  development_project_diablo_canyon_npp_wtt_desc:0 "The titan of California's pre-war power generation, the Diablo Canyon Power Plant still cuts an imposing figure long after its service to America ended. A 900 acre span of land right on the western shore, the power plant is grand in size and design, though time and seismic activity have left it sporting hopefully negligible scars. Hopefully, we may use it in the way those before us did.\n"
  development_project_satsop_npp_wtt:0 "Restore the Satsop NPP"
  development_project_satsop_npp_wtt_desc:0 "The Satsop Nuclear Power Plant came into the world a grand plan, one which stood unfulfilled by the time the bombs dropped. First commissioned by the WPPSS (the Whoops!), the plant was meant to consist of five large plants designed to supply the vast majority of Washington's energy demand. When the Great War broke out, only two of the five had been constructed, though these two plants were built to last, and could pay dividends if restored.\n"
  development_project_palo_verde_npp_wtt:0 "Restore the Palo Verde NGS"
  development_project_palo_verde_npp_wtt_desc:0 "Before the war, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station was known to be the most productive nuclear power plant in the US, producing 3.3 gigawatts of electricity on average. The Palo Verde Station was quite unique in the fact that it was integrated into the surrounding infrastructure, utilizing sewage in order to run. Though it may take some ingenuity to operate in any capacity, we could stand to supply a vast swathe of our demand if we manage. The smell is just a feature.\n"
  development_project_first_solar_spp_wtt:0 "Scavenge the First Solar Stockpiles"
  development_project_first_solar_spp_wtt_desc:0 "Though nuclear power was dominant from its discovery all the way to the end of the modern world, it was not the sole source of electricity. Solar power, while initially crude, was popular enough for various companies to invest heavily into it. Among them is First Solar, a company whose stockpile of solar panels have gone unnoticed and unexploited since the dropping of the bombs. A mere investment of learned labour would be sufficient to install and make use of these panels.\n"
  development_project_crecent_dunes_spp_wtt:0 "Restore the Crescent Dunes Project"
  development_project_crecent_dunes_spp_wtt_desc:0 "Even though HELIOS One is known to many as a near-mythical source of power for the Mojave Wasteland, it's not the only one of its kind in Nevada. The Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project, though not as grand or efficient as HELIOS One, stands to be a major source of energy for anyone able to hold and operate it. It would be wise to invest into the project's operation.\n"
  development_project_mountain_home_afb_wtt:0 "Restore the Mountain Home Air Force Base"
  development_project_mountain_home_afb_wtt_desc:0 "Made treacherous by the dropping of the bombs, the Northwest Commonwealth served as the American staging ground for much of the Sino-American War, particularly for battles waged in Alaska. From this, it is easy to infer that a great deal of pre-war materiel is stashed away in the region, particularly in Mountain Home Air Force Base. Clearing the base of debris and making use of the site and its equipment should be prioritized.\n"
  development_project_el_centro_afb_wtt:0 "Restore the NAF El Centro"
  development_project_el_centro_afb_wtt_desc:0 "Right on the border of California and Mexico is the Naval Air Facility El Centro, an American installation that served various purposes throughout America's pre-war history. In times of conflict, the facility was a staging ground for naval air operations on the west coast. In peace, an almost propagandistic projection of American force. The stores of pre-war equipment, as well as the strategic value of the installation, are not to be ignored.\n"
  development_project_whidbey_island_afb_wtt:0 "Restore the NASWI"
  development_project_whidbey_island_afb_wtt_desc:0 "Located at the very tip of the Northwest Commonwealth is the Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, a good-sized military installation which served various purposes up until the Great War. Like many other installations in the area, the NASWI was a valuable staging ground for the war in Alaska, and retains much of its old equipment from when soldiers bustled about the island.\n"
  development_project_beale_afb_wtt:0 "Restore the Beale Air Force Base"
  development_project_beale_afb_wtt_desc:0 "Remarkable in scale and scope, the Beale Air Force base served a great many purposes throughout pre-war history, named after a similarly grand figure from American history. A 23,000 acre swathe of land, the base was once host to a mass amount of soldiers and materiel, and even long after the Great War, hidden caches and resource-rich land still remain.\n"
  development_project_fairchild_afb_wtt:0 "Restore the Fairchild Air Force Base"
  development_project_fairchild_afb_wtt_desc:0 "Like similar bases in the Northwest Commonwealth, the Fairchild Air Force Base was a vital military emplacement throughout the Sino-American War, albeit one with a much shorter and rockier history than most. As the Battle of Anchorage began in earnest, the Chinese sought to attack America from behind their lines, staging a coup out of Fairchild. Much of the equipment abandoned during the fighting can still be found where it was dropped, much in usable or restorable condition.\n"
  development_project_cfb_comox_afb_wtt:0 "Clean up Comox Valley Airport"
  development_project_cfb_comox_afb_wtt_desc:0 "Comox had a hybrid civillian and millitary airport until the United States shut it down. It's been in a state of frozen decay since the Great War, but a little clean-up can make the air strip functional... and possibly the anti-aircraft guns."
  development_project_sierra_army_depot_wtt:0 "Restore the Sierra Army Depot"
  development_project_sierra_army_depot_wtt_desc:0 "There is much to be salvaged from this old Enclave facility."
  development_project_joint_base_lewis_mchord_wtt:0 "Restore Joint Base Lewis-McChord"
  development_project_joint_base_lewis_mchord_wtt_desc:0 "An amalgamation of Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base, to say it was an important staging ground for the Battle of Anchorage and the Chinese Invasion would be an understatement. Theoretically, we could restore the airstrip to make up for the mass graves in Seatac, and maybe get some of the ammunition production online to free ourselves up elsewhere."
  development_project_fort_irwin_wtt:0 "Clear Fort Irwin Services"
  development_project_fort_irwin_wtt_desc:0 "Fort Irwin has been many things: an firing range of all sizes, a combat exercise training hub, and an exclusive hospital. The explosives shop can be put to use making more armaments if made safe, and maybe we can learn something from their training manuals and the hospital equipment too."
  development_project_fort_carson_wtt:0 "Restore Fort Carson"
  development_project_fort_carson_wtt_desc:0 "The big mountain to the west steals attention to those who know, but those who don't know focus on the much more public Fort Carson for scrapping the remaining hostile robots. Perhaps it's for the better to focus on it before some foolish tribal goes home with the goods?"
  development_project_pueblo_chemical_depot_wtt:0 "Harvest Pueblo Chemical Depot"
  development_project_pueblo_chemical_depot_wtt_desc:0 "Just east of Steeltown and northeast of Pueblo City is a massive crater full of liquids that'll kill you if you touch it. We can make use of this and free up our weapons production! Oh, and maybe figure out how to make stuff not die in case we catch it."
  development_project_usafa_solar_plant_wtt:0 "Restore the USAFA Solar Plant"
  development_project_usafa_solar_plant_wtt_desc:0 "Originally opened by the U.S. Air Force Academy outside of Colorado Springs, the USAFA solar plant was built to decrease the military's reliance on fossil fuels. Boasting a collective output of over 6 megawatts, a surprising amount of the plant's panels remain intact despite their proximity to a military installation. With the right people, equipment and knowhow we could surely make use of it.\n"
  development_project_aurora_armory_wtt:0 "Restore the Aurora Armory"
  development_project_aurora_armory_wtt_desc:0 "Belonging to the Colorado National Guard long ago, the Aurora Armory was the installation responsible for equiping those on the eastern side of Denver. As such, its stock was closely guarded, but one would find an abundance of guns and useful machinery were they able to break inside...\n"
  development_project_blue_castle_npp_wtt:0 "Restore the Blue Castle Nuclear Plant"
  development_project_blue_castle_npp_wtt_desc:0 "Originally proposed decades before the war as part of the Blue Castle Project, what exists of the plant just south of East Carbon stands as a shadow of the ambitious plan to transition Utah further towards nuclear power. Regardless, by wasteland standards what little of the project was completed would make it an enormous source of energy. Putting the plant back in working condition would be no small feat, but if achieved it would aid in our energy independence tremendously.\n"
  development_project_katana_electronics_wtt:0 "Restore Katana Electronics"
  development_project_katana_electronics_wtt_desc:0 "A pre-war Utah based electronics manufacturer based just east of the Great Salt Lake, Katana Electronics faced surprisingly steep competition from competitors in the area. A service provider which operated primarily as a contractor, their plant boasted the widest variety in electronic components of any corporation in the state before the bombs fell. Needless to say, were their plant to be restored to working order it would provide us with the opportunity to produce proper, well-crafted electronic components at a far greater capacity.\n"
  development_project_tooele_army_depot_wtt:0 "Clear Tooele Army Depot"
  development_project_tooele_army_depot_wtt_desc:0 "Machining, fabrication, robotics, and updating of United States weapons systems was done here before the war, and its defenses did much to make the bounty inaccessible. The storage of an embarrassingly large amount of bullets and weapons makes this place single-handedly able to power a war effort once made safe."
  development_project_dugway_proving_ground_wtt:0 "Look over the Dug-way Proving Ground"
  development_project_dugway_proving_ground_wtt_desc:0 "South of the Great Salt Lake used to be a biological and chemical weapons facility. Leading up to the Great War, this testing was moved elsewhere, and the Proving Ground was repurposed for Combined Arms testing, with the T-45d being put through its trials here once. There is danger here, but it's much more manageable than if there had been a sample of the New Plague."
  development_project_spanish_fork_armory_wtt:0 "Improve Spanish Fork Armoury"
  development_project_spanish_fork_armory_wtt_desc:0 "The Spanish Fork Armoury narrowly avoided decommissioning multiple times throughout its history, ultimately expanding into a major weapons and munitions storage facility that covered the history of weaponry through the 20th and 21st centuries. With enough effort, this place can be made even more effective at its former mission. Surely, this wono't backfire."
  development_project_fort_bliss_wtt:0 "Turn the Blissful Sands Safe"
  development_project_fort_bliss_wtt_desc:0 "It's hard to know where the Blissful Sands end and the rest of the Wasteland begins from the ground. What used to be some sort of major Pre-War facility and the launch point for the Mexican occupation has now become a no-man's land that even the Deathclaws avoid to prevent getting blown up or shot to pieces. There's certainly something to get out of clearing a military facility, but this is more so people can walk through here without falling into a trap."
  development_project_fort_huachuca_wtt:0 "Empty Fort Huachuca R&D"
  development_project_fort_huachuca_wtt_desc:0 "Finding it's roots in the late 1870, Fort Huachuca has a long history in its service to the US military. Before the war, it was a place dedicated to computer networks and electronics, being host to the US military's NETCOM and other advanced Radar networks. There's probably not much that can be obtained now, but there is absolutely information to be gained from the databanks of this place, and even some of the Radar networks rebuilt."
  development_project_yuma_proving_ground_wtt:0 "Operate the Yuma Proving Ground"
  development_project_yuma_proving_ground_wtt_desc:0 "All sorts of weapons and armor were both tested and prototyped once upon a time in this corner of Arizona. It's not a safe place to be in currently due to those weapons being able to kill you, but if it weren't, the Proving Ground could turn its prototyping capabilities over to our own manufacture output."
  development_project_naval_air_station_fallon_wtt:0 "Shut Down Naval the Fallon Broadcast"
  development_project_naval_air_station_fallon_wtt_desc:0 "Why is there a naval facility in the middle of the desert? Whatever the reason, there's been broadcasting from it the same songs from the same artist as far back as anyone can remember. There's obvious benefits to restoring this place, but let's be honest here, you can only hear about the highway to the danger zone so many times before you want to get off."
  development_project_naval_air_station_lemoore_wtt:0 "Restore Lemoore Station"
  development_project_naval_air_station_lemoore_wtt_desc:0 "Just on the edge of one of the many craters filling America is a place that sticks out like a sore thumb in the middle of New California. There's a titanic airplane base, and if turned to a modern purpose could easily flourish again. Unfortunately, the big size requires a big investment, but improving this section of California between the major population centers will have great benefits in the long run."
  development_project_naval_air_weapon_station_china_lake_wtt:0 "Restore Naval Air Weapon Station China Lake"
  development_project_naval_air_weapon_station_china_lake_wtt_desc:0 "This home to a stockpile of grenade launchers didn't blow up from a nuclear warhead- in fact, a major earthquake led to the facility shuttering two decades before the Great War. Today, this means there's an intact stockpile of weapons manufacturing and possibly an air strip that can be reclaimed- it all depends on how the fight against the defenses left behind go."
  development_project_naval_weapons_station_seal_beach_wtt:0 "Return Seal Beach to a Cleaner Slate"
  development_project_naval_weapons_station_seal_beach_wtt_desc:0 "The Seal Beach Wildlife Refuge was already doomed before the bombs fell, having turned into a waste dump for the army and navy. The Boneyard's lack of population has led to a miracle of no more pollutants being brought in, and much of the dangers have drained into the Pacific. There is no returning Seal Beach as it was, but a cleanup operation of the dumpster that shouldn't exist could allow for further development nearby, and remove yet another black mark on the continent caused by the United States of America."
  development_project_naval_base_san_diego_wtt:0 "Restore Naval Base San Diego"
  development_project_naval_base_san_diego_wtt_desc:0 "On the edge of Dayglow, half-swallowed by the sea are is what was clearly once a major port, half filled with the rusted hulks of ships gone by. It's been fenced off to the public since Dayglow formed a governing body, but some of the former base can be brought back to its original purpose. Some of it."
  development_project_naval_auxiliary_landing_field_san_clemente_island_wtt:0 "Militarize Clemente Island"
  development_project_naval_auxiliary_landing_field_san_clemente_island_wtt_desc:0 "The United States once used the San Clemente Island to  house a notable naval base just off the coast of Los Angeles. Today, Clemente Island's few inhabitants are largely peaceful, and have made very hidden shelters and defenses to keep it that way. This could be built into a major naval facility once more, regardless of what the Clemente Island peopel think."
  development_project_naval_base_ventura_wtt:0 "Restore Naval Base Ventura"
  development_project_naval_base_ventura_wtt_desc:0 "A merge of Port Hueneme and Point Mugu at the turn of the millenium, there's a dichotomy between the two halves that is felt even in its ruins today. Formerly under investigation by the Followers of the Apocalypse, it has been cordoned off by them when one Doctor too many died within its bounds. Yet just because the Followers can't restore this place to working order doesn't mean others cannot."
  development_project_grand_coulee_wtt:0 "Turn on Grand Coulee Dam"
  development_project_grand_coulee_wtt_desc:0 "Right within sight of the small settlement of Granogan is an old dam, used as a crossing point to venture further north."
  development_project_naval_base_kitsap_wtt:0 "Restore Naval Base Kitsap"
  development_project_naval_base_kitsap_wtt_desc:0 "Two former Naval Bases duct-taped together, the Puget was patrolled from this behemoth of a base prior to the Great War. It was the nucleus of the Shining Seas Initiative, meant to prevent unregulated boating and fishing during wartime. It was nuked, but a little time and money can perhaps revive the Initiative for our own ends."
  development_project_naval_magazine_indian_island_wtt:0 "Restore Naval Magazine Indian Island"
  development_project_naval_magazine_indian_island_wtt_desc:0 "The Shining Seas Initiative led to what was once a major submarine repair base to expand into a major port that supported the Anchorage Reclamation, and a successful nuke targeting the island. Restoring a whole island is a tough job, but it can lead to dominance of the Fookuh."
  development_project_naval_station_everett_wtt:0 "Restore Naval Station Everett"
  development_project_naval_station_everett_wtt_desc:0 "The Skagit and the Susan were heavily patrolled pre-War for smugglers, dissenters, and other malcontents as part of the Shining Seas Initiative. This led to considerable investment by the Navy, and at least one nuclear warhead targeting it. Implementing safety measures and getting docks working will assist in projecting the Broken Coast."
  development_project_CFB_equimalt_wtt:0 "Improve Victoria Harbour"
  development_project_CFB_equimalt_wtt_desc:0 "The Victoria Harbour is already the best along the Pacific and a wonderful home amidst the Fookuh, let alone the Broken Coast. That doesn't mean it can't be better, but doing so risks triggering surprises the Americans left so long ago. It'll require preperation, but the end result will be quite worthy indeed."
  development_project_vandenberg_afb_wtt:0 "Restore Vandenberg Space Center"
  development_project_vandenberg_afb_wtt_desc:0 "A missile and rocket launch site, this Space Center was where those who fought in the Sea of Tranquility left the planet never to return. Orbit alone is maybe too tall an order, but getting the SAM sites functioning is much closer to Earth."
  development_project_red_river_army_depot_wtt:0 "Make R-Rad Useful"
  development_project_red_river_army_depot_wtt_desc:0 "R-Rad is a massive junkyard and blasted out heap that seems to have once been a motor pool. Getting rid of the dangers and repurposing it to something like it's original purpose will at least make the place bearable to look at."
  development_project_sheppard_afb_wtt:0 "Rebuild Sheppard Air Force Base"
  development_project_sheppard_afb_wtt_desc:0 "Sold to the government for a dollar, this air force base was originally home to a large amount of technical training until the UN dissolved. From there, it became a major pilot training center until the bombs fell; pilots who took off no longer had a country to serve by the time they had to land. With enough equipment and funding, pilots could fly from here again."
  development_project_dyess_afb_wtt:0 "Honour Owens' Stand?"
  development_project_dyess_afb_wtt_desc:0 "Famously once Dyess Air Force Base and the missile silo complex surrounding Abilene, here was where Colonel Carrie Owens saved the future of Lone Star before it began. Owens' Stand has since become a quiet memorial to those dark days, but enough funding can commission a crew to return it to working order. In these times, it would be beneficial, albeit debatable how honoured the late Colonel would be."
  development_project_cabin_creek_spp_wtt:0 "Restore Cabin Creek Solar Farm"
  development_project_cabin_creek_spp_wtt_desc:0 "The joint project of solar developer Clenera and Basin Electric Power Cooperative, Cabin Creek's solar farm provided a modest but not insignificant amount of power to Montana in its prime. Though the installation has been a victim to scavengers and the passage of time like any other, a team of skillful enough engineers could likely restore it to working condition.\n"
  development_project_hoover_western_boatlift_wtt:0 "Repair the Western Boatlift at the Hoover Dam"
  development_project_hoover_western_boatlift_wtt_desc:0 "While the Hoover Dam was for many years after its construction an impassible barrier across the Colorado River, shortly before the Great War the Americans embarked on an ambitioius engineering project to tackle this. Under the direction of the US Corps of Engineers, civilian contractors constructed two \"boatlifts\" (glorified locks): one on either side of the Dam. While theoretically designed to improve trade up and down the river, the locks never opened to civilian traffic before the Great War began.

  development_project_del_norte_international_afb_wtt_desc:0 "Just inside Monterrey, Del Norte International worked as a secondary airport to Monterrey, and was home to over 100 hangars. Most of these were reserved for private use, but the Mexican Air Force also owned a portion and ran routine pilot training at the location. As such, many useful documents on military flying no doubt reside within it--on top of many occupied hangars still left locked."
  development_project_villanueva_spp_wtt:0 "Restore Villanueva Solar Plant"
  development_project_villanueva_spp_wtt_desc:0 "The Villanueva Solar Plant, by its completion, was the largest in all of Mexico, and for a time the largest in all of the Americas. Unfortunately, its proximity to Torreon and two centuries spent without any maintenance has left its peak potential out of reach, but it could still provide substantial energy output if repaired."
  development_project_puerto_libertad_spp_wtt:0 "Restore Puerto Libertad Solar Photovoltaic Park"
  development_project_puerto_libertad_spp_wtt_desc:0 "Completed in the early 21st century in a project by Acciona Energia and Tuto Energy, the Puerto Libertade Solar PV Park possessed the power to provide for hundreds of thousands of homes in Sonora. In practice, the involved private companies and the federal government siphoned most of this output to meet their own needs, but whether or not we follow in this trend will not make putting it back into operation any less fruitful."
  development_project_sunnyvale_afb_wtt:0 "Solve the Cube"
  development_project_sunnyvale_afb_wtt_desc:0 "There's a big blue cube in the midst of the remains of Sunnyvale on the edge of the San Francisco Bay. Those who enter typically die, and those who manage to return never get very far. It's a mystery what the Cube contains, but sometimes, amateur radio operators pick up mysterious signals from it.\n\nThere's something related to the sky deep in its bowels, but first the Cube needs to stop being such a death trap."
  development_project_castle_afb_wtt:0 "Clear Up Castle"
  development_project_castle_afb_wtt_desc:0 "A prison, a car track, and something regarding wasps are found all over what seems to have been an airport at one point. Today, it's a bloatfly nest surrounding unknown dangers, and nearby inhabitants regularly hunt there for food. Funding, if provided, can allow it to become far more useful and improve the local diet."
  development_project_george_afb_wtt:0 "Re-Open George AFB"
  development_project_george_afb_wtt_desc:0 "A training school for the Tactical Air Command prior to the Great War, it has since been largely picked over by scavengers and the odd raider band or two since. Training on large gun installations can still be done here if opened, though the air strip has been left to rot and may be a bit of a gamble."
  development_project_norton_afb_wtt:0 "Restore Norton AFB"  
  development_project_luke_afb_wtt:0 "Restore Luke AFB"
  development_project_luke_afb_wtt_desc:0 "One of the most prominent Military installations in the entirety of Arizona, Luke is host to Air Education and Training Command, with a long history in pilot training. The resources here could allow for significant breakthroughs in pilot training and safety while in the air, as well as provide a strategic airport in the region."
  development_project_davismonthan_afb_wtt:0 "Restore Davis-Monthan AFB"
  development_project_davismonthan_afb_wtt_desc:0 "A massive pre-War Military installation located in Tucson, before the war it used to be the largest aircraft restoration and storage facility in the world. Now, after the war most of the boneyards planes are destroyed, but some can still be salvaged and put back into service. The rest that aren't air worthy can be studied for later usage and production."
  development_project_norton_afb_wtt:0 "Restore Norton AFB"
  development_project_norton_afb_wtt_desc:0 "At one time on the verge of shutting down, the American occupation of Mexico empowered this base with the Inspector General able to get anything he wanted. Today, that leaves multiple massive guns pointed skyward that can make or break the local defenses. The air strip, however, is possibly a lost cause due to the lines of parallel craters."
  development_project_creech_afb_wtt:0 "Restore Creech AFB"
  development_project_creech_afb_wtt_desc:0 "Another one of Nevada's Military installations, not far from Area 51 and Nellis Air Force Base. Once used before the war for pilot training and weapon experimentation. If restored, it could provide greater aerial access to the close regions in Nevada and California."
  development_project_fort_ord_wtt:0 "Renovate Ord Monument"
  development_project_fort_ord_wtt_desc:0 "A coastline of war and peace, Ord was so beloved for its beaches that it was opened up to the public and became a National Monument early in the 21st century. Since then, the surf has become greener, and the coast more dangerous. Sure, we can get some extra production out of clearing out the remaining military hardware and learn a thing or two, but sometimes, people want to lay back and feel the warmth of the sun while enveloped in the sand. Surf's up!"
  development_project_sacramento_army_depot_wtt:0 "Restore the Sacramento Army Depot"
  development_project_sacramento_army_depot_wtt_desc:0 "In the midst of Sac-Town's ruins lies a facility full of electronics. Possibly unused at the time of the Great War, the remaining computer motherboards could be installed to optimize local production. But the real treasure is the tall spire that can be used as a lookout point- or maybe more."
  development_project_grand_coulee_wtt:0 "Generate Grand Coulee Dam Power"
  development_project_grand_coulee_wtt_desc:0 "Just a stone's throw away from the tiny settlement of Granogan lies a big chunk of uninhabited ruins and what's been called a big stone bridge. This isn't a bridge though- it's a hydroelectric dam, and could be used to generate electricity if turned on, hooked up, and given some tender love and care. There's a mess down south about a Dam though- let's hope it doesn't cause something similar."
  development_project_sarsparilla_factory_wtt:0 "Bottle Sunset Sarsparilla"
  development_project_sarsparilla_factory_wtt_desc:0 "Surrounded by way too many Fiends than is comfortable lies a bottling plant. Sunset Sarsparilla used to be headquartered here, and if both the Fiends and the factory defenses are shut down, we could not only acquire the recipe, we could also set up a manner of distribution, whether through a business or directly through us. Just two issues are present in this scheme: the prospectors trying to get into the rooms we can't get into, and the horror that is halitosis."
  development_project_underground_farm_wtt:0 "Refurbish the Bountiful Farm"
  development_project_underground_farm_wtt_desc:0 "Stories are told between those who dwell in the Plaguelands about a room so filled with soil and specialized lighting that no one would ever have to go hungry again. There's a truth to this, hidden in the depths of the Westworld- there really is a large underground farming complex named the Bountiful Farm, and it can ensure food and water for decades if made to work again. But before any of that must come the hard work of making the place even function."
  development_project_car_crusher_wtt:0 "Flick the Giant Car Crusher's Switch"
  development_project_car_crusher_wtt_desc:0 "Scrapyard folk have been talking about an admittedly big car crusher that has been used to produce countless compressed squares of scrap. Old timers discuss how one day in their childhoods, it stopped working, and anyone who made an attempt to get to where it could be turned on died. It's time to provide incentive to figure out why the Giant Car Crusher has kept its jaws open for generations, and make a bunch of large pieces of junk into something more malleable."
  development_project_chico_ac_wtt:0 "Recover the Secrets of Air Conditioning"
  development_project_chico_ac_wtt_desc:0 "Before the War, Poseidon Energy gave a few projects not worth their time over to their friends at Petro-Chico. One such project was to be the next evolution in controlled climates, making the coldest winds turn to naught and the muggiest humidity dryer than a desert. There was never any fruit borne to the point of it being mass-marketed, but perhaps there's a prototype that can get working and copied from there."
  development_project_fewarren_afb_wtt:0 "Carve a Path to the Nuclear Fearen"
  development_project_fewarren_afb_wtt_desc:0 "Once, nuclear missiles were commanded to commit the last act of the United States here. Now, plenty remains, but the radioactive craters emit so much radiation that even Ghouls risk going feral too swiftly. The best solution to get around this is to start digging underground, until eventually the prize in the Nuclear Fearen presents itself."
  development_project_minuteman_historic_wtt:0 "Arm the Atlin Gun"
  development_project_minuteman_historic_wtt_desc:0 "Part of the reason that there are so many robots located in the Plaguelands was that they were automated defenses for many missiles and rockets. No nuclear missiles remain, but there are enough rockets around that these defenses can be brought to life once more. It's a shame the radiation in the area requires significant shielding to get close enough to retrieve it."
  development_project_minot_silo_wtt:0 "Fortify the Tower"
  development_project_minot_silo_wtt_desc:0 "On the edge of the Silofields lies what could be considered a monument to nuclear warheads- a lone standing tower, while the rest of the surrounding area was blasted into a massive crater, tunnels and all. These can be dug out to connect to other bunkers and increase the defenses in the area, but it will be costly and likely dangerous to do so. If only faith were enough."
  development_project_giddyup_buttercup_wtt:0 "Play with Giddyup Buttercup"
  development_project_giddyup_buttercup_wtt_desc:0 "In 2054, Arlen Glass purchased some land from the Crow Reservation, intending to set up a Wilston Atomatoys factory to employ the local populace. This was soon after made false, as a tax break for the company came in exchange for employing European immigrants instead at the facility. A little over twenty years later, this no longer mattered, and the factory laid silent. Yet deep down, what children are not happy playing with a toy? Restarting the factory will bring joy to Montana that few can understand, and no longer will there be such a betrayal lying over their smiles."
  development_project_cleanup_uranium_wtt:0 "Clean up the Uranium"
  development_project_cleanup_uranium_wtt_desc:0 "When the Arapaho left the region around Riverton, Lander, and Crowheart, the drop in population revealed why so many were sick and crops had trouble growing. All this time, there was a uranium mill in the northwest of the Dust, buried when the bombs fell. Cleaning it up will turn the Dust in time into something worth building in.\n\nIt raises a question why nobody did so pre-war: was the United States government so full of jerks to let people suffer and die for a business?"
  development_project_compensating_gun_wtt:0 "Whip Out the Compensater"
  development_project_compensating_gun_wtt_desc:0 "Big Jude was a Texan gunsmith with a dream like no other to make the largest gun possible. He scoured every junkyard, gathered as much gunpowder as possible, and spent way too long denying allegations that the project was to make up for his downstairs equipment size. These allegations were proven false when an Ironmonger killed Big Jude with a shot to the groin, the remnants confirming he had every reason to be confident. While Big Jude may have passed away, his gun, remembered as 'the Compensator' is close to completion. It just needs the power turned on- which is harder than it sounds."
  development_project_stoon_cave_wtt:0 "Enter the Stoon Cave"
  development_project_stoon_cave_wtt_desc:0 "For some time now, Pierre Solomon has spent most of his leisure hours in the basement floors of his estate. Few know the truth of what goes down there, but Beya has convinced Solomon that the smell has gotten bad enough it needs to be treated like a radioactive cleanup. The appropriate bribes- erm, funding can ensure he doesn't live atop a dangerous area. All we know is that there are weird noises made when Pierre Solomon goes below, and to never, under any circumstances, bring a blacklight."
