  nf_chc.1.desc:0 "When atomic energy thrived, so did the interest in the limits of mortality.  The Choir Experiments were a pre-war study into unlocking the hidden powers of the human mind and body.  Individuals with musical prowess and children with ailments were offered a lifetime opportunity; to become something beyond. \n\n Many had joined to aid the scientists’ ultimate goal of advanced medical treatments—if the hidden potential of the human body could be accessed, then a gateway could be opened to treating deadly illnesses and conditions.  Others wanted a chance to live again.  And the rest...?  For one reason or another, their enrollment was questionable—kept off the books, to say the least.  #0005 had belonged to the third group.   \n\n V (A name taken after the roman numeral on her cell's floor) had spent most of her life as a number—a result, a footnote on reports and papers—that she had forgotten her own name, no less the face of her parents.  People came and went.  Different hands held hers and took her to different places; all sterile rooms and white coats.  While the world in V’s eyes was lush with colour, silence followed her like a wraith.  It was only until she was eight that she met others like her. \n\n Most of the days with the folk in white coats were spent being poked and prodded.  She was placed in chambers and connected to tubes—immersed in gas or strange, glowing liquids.  They had placed cups and vases in front of her, forcing her to sing until the glass shattered.  The strenuous trials dizzied her as did most of her peers, many of whom had slipped into comas and failed to wake.   \n\n So she treasured her free-time more than anything else and spent much of it buried in her one and only book; a massive tome that held many examples of poetry. But, when her young eyes tired of reading, V was enraptured in..."

Our sanity was deeply disfigured by the entire experience; it left most of us bitter, unstable, and bloodthirsty. \n\nBut, dying here was not to be our fate. On the day of our salvation, a bellowing explosion penetrated walls of the facility, and shortly after it shook as if it had come to life! The scientists and personnel scrambled to emergency stations as rubble began to rain from the ceiling and equipment fell to the floor. The sheer magnitude of the destruction shook us free of our binds and obliterated whatever foul machinery had suppressed our voices! The slaughter was quick, psykers ripping to shreds any unfortunate souls unable to escape in time; those that did manage to get to the surface were obliterated by the fresh radiation that now blanketed the world above. \n\nBefore even an hour had passed, our uprising was complete, leaving us in charge of a quickly deteriorating home. There was little time before the entire east wing of the facility collapsed, but we could save either the infirmary, or the materials research labs."

But, with all of us possessing psychic powers, we could still exert some influence on the world. Through a short and (mostly) painless process, we learned that we could bend normal wastelanders to our will; turning them into perfectly obediant, mindless thralls. With this knowledge, the harvest began almost immediately. Before long, we had accumulated a workforce numbering in the hundreds. Now, we simply had to put our slaves to work!

  nf_chc.4.desc:0 "When the Choir rose to the surface of the new world, they came to learn that they weren’t the only ghosts of the experiment to survive.  It began as a whisper down the corridors.  Of spiteful lamenting and tidings of a future incomprehensible.  It was only after sharing their encounters with the disembodied voice that they realised it was not a figment of their shattered psyche, but a presence that was very, very real. \n\n Celestina called it the ‘ill omen’.  To her, every sickenly sweet whisper carried an ominous wind; lies under a maternal guise.  \n\n Dawn was frightened by the voice.  While she practised medicine—patching the wounds of mutated animals she found collapsed on the sides of the roads—it had told her to kill. \n\n Omma was indifferent.  The voice bothered her little, though she remarked that they shared a sentimental spirit and pain.  When she sang to herself, the voice joined her. \n\n Morgana considered it an opportunity for greatness.  It illustrated a dazzling future for the Choir, one where they lived lavishly in castles and threatric galas.  \n\n Lysander called it ‘Mother’, and his insistence that the rest refer to it as such spread.  He described that she was the first voice lost and that they ought to respect her wishes out of goodwill. \n\n And while the different opinions the Choir held about Mother clashed, V was the closest to the voice.  It was the loudest to her, the most clear.  She knew its true name, and its true purpose."

With every day that passed, a compromise for all seemed near impossible.  What to do with Mother had to be one way or the other, and V’s mind was set. \n\nThe Choir exchanged their pleasantries—passing glances, sneers, nods—before rallying around the war table.  The song of the astral palace swelled with each belt and baritone.  Pastel papercraft blossomed at their feet, unfurling away like origami along the walls, pillars, and towards the ceiling.  A gentle breeze fluttered through from a disembodied window, carrying with it the taste of morning dew. \n\nOnce their combined consciousnesses had finished moulding the room to their desired reality, V took the stand. \n\n“This will be our last meeting on the topic of what to do with Mother,” she began, her boldness earning raised brows.  “I’ve weighed the options, and I’ve decided.  Whether you agree or not doesn’t matter.  We have to move forward.” \n\n“Nonsensical,” scoffed Lysander.  “You came to a conclusion without consulting us?” \n\n“As head of the Choir, I expect you to accept it,” V shot him a dismissive glance.   “If you don’t, the door is that way.

We will destroy her, and then continue forth with peaceful methods.  No Possessed, no cruelty, no violence.  I want us to reclaim our civility.  Thoughts?” \n\nCelestina smiled as she fluttered her eyes shut.  Proud. \n\nDawn beamed, her eyes glimmering.  Joy. \n\nLysander, Morgana, and Omma ranged from bewildered to indifferent.  Heeding V’s prior advice, Morgana left the room.  Omma remained, her head tilted down in acceptance. \n\n“Ludicrous!  Ridiculous!  Have you no shame or grip on reality?”  Lysander fumed.   “You’ve doomed us all!  Mother is the only way forward.” \n\n“You are free to contest my authority.”  V’s eyes flared as she gestured around.  “Everyone here is in agreement.  So, go ahead, Lysander.  Do your worst.” \n\n“That’s not— This is—” Lysander blinked before shaking his head.  “Fine.  Run to your dooms for all I care.”  He combed back his dishevelled hair, and with another spiteful glance around he left. \n\nFinally, Celestina opened her eyes.  “You made the right choice, V,” she said, her voice soothing.  “You’ve saved us and so many more.”"

Pride. \n\nMorgana nodded, chuckling to herself about how it was about time.  Opportunity. \n\nOmma closed her eyes and tilted her chin down.  Acceptance. \n\nBoth Celestina and Dawn were baffled.  Dawn stumbled over her words, trying to piece together an objection, but ultimately failed under the crushing weight of everyone’s stares.  She scurried out of the room. \n\n“V,” Celestina bellowed with a rare anger.  “You’ve made a grave mistake.  Mother is not a blessing, she is a curse—a downfall to not only us but the entire world.  How could you?” \n\n“You are free to object,” V said, gesturing around.  “But that means you contest the rest of us.” \n\nCelestina bit the inside of her cheek.  Heeding V’s advice, she too left the room. \n\n“You don’t really mean to let them go, do you?”  Morgana asked, inspecting her nails. \n\n“I lied.”  V shrugged.  “Get the Dowagers to pursue them.

  nf_chc.11.title:0 "The Taskmaster and the Druid"
  nf_chc.11.desc:0 "It was one of those rare days when V wasn't needed for much; no warplans to sign off on, no caps to count, no consultation with Mother. Most wastelanders would enjoy having a day off, but for an ideologically driven psyker having nothing to devote yourself to was....stressful. Pacing back and forth across the facility, making small talk with the Dowagers, and inspecting possessed had been all she could cook up to occupy herself. Bordering dangerously close to the prospect of taking up a hobby, she was almost relieved to hear an argument down the hallway, emanating from Lysander's Office. V skulked up to the door, it sat halfway open and allowed much of the altercation to spill out into the hall. \n\n"You'll kill them!" Exclaimed a high, soubrette sounding voice. It was met with an exhasperated male sigh. V poked her head around the door frame, catching sight of the two. Dawn and Lysander, two of V's inner circle, were arguing over a desk, upon which lay a half completed charcoal drawing of a factory. Dawn —clad in her green, naturalistic cloak— stood infront of the desk, with her hands planted on either side of the schematic. The other party in the argument, Lysander, was sunk into his big faux-leather office chair; his face rested on a closed fist and his eyes dragging between the plans on his desk and the indignant lady infront of him. The expression on his face was one of pure exasperation, but as the conversation went on his demeanor visibly steamed into frustration. The two went on bickering over details as V's mind trailed off, thinking less about the subject and more about the two of them. \n\nDawn was, in all senses of the word, soft. Her voice was inoffensive in tone and pleasant in timbre, complementing what was a gentle personality and pacifistic worldview. Dawn was most at home surrounded by the natural wasteland —something she had a psychically enhanced affinity over— and preferred the company of plants and woodland creatures far before people. She was, in pure practical terms, weak. Even if Dawn possessed the will to harm people, her sheltered lifestyle meant she'd lose in a fight against anything stronger than a particularly motivated hobo. This mostly wasn't an issue, as her place in the battlefield was far behind the front lines practicing medicine on both Psykers, and the many Possessed. She was motivated mostly by...well, V wasn't sure! It wasn't the Mother, and it wasn't a particular fondness of anybody in the Choir. Maybe she was just afraid of being alone?"

  nf_chc.1122.title:0 "Of Molerats and Men"
  nf_chc.1122.desc:0 "Then, there was Lysander. Driven, calculating, and an expert in his field, Lysander had been a wealthy real estate mogul from before the war. Through local connections in the government and business he had not only found out about the Psyker Program, but bought his way into it; securing himself both the strongest psychic powers money could buy, and effective immortality. The process he had undergone had stripped away what empathy and emotional sensitivty he had beforehand, but that never seemed to bother him. No, his greatest bother was inefficiency, and it seemed the only emotional core he had left was devotion. Pure, zealous devotion to furthering Mother's plans and seeing her rebuilt; it was only for his lack of social ability that he was relegated to the position he was in, instead of V's. \n\nV's attention returned to the argument as it came to a head, between her musings she had picked up this was over some pre-war concrete factory just north of the Chapel; most of the equipment was untouched and the building was in fairly good condition, the only barrier being it was horribly infested with molerats. Lysander had drawn up plans to exterminate them and get the factory working again, whilst Dawn had taken umbrage with the notion of slaying the animals just for the sake of a few assembly lines. "Y-You can't do that! It's... wrong!" She wailed, shaking from the waist up with outrage, her hands balled into fists; seeing this caused Lysander's face to curl into a thin smile, his long arms unfurled and exposed him to a punch he was certain would never come. "What are you going to do, Rat Lover? Stop me?" Dawn wilted and turned away, her eyes wetting with tears; frustration with both his behavior and her own weakness twisted her face into a pitiful scowl. As Dawn turned from him, she caught a glance at V standing in the doorway; Lysander noticed shortly after, and the two waited for V to put input her opinion on the subject."

The majority of them stood in rows at attention, while a small group of thralls handed out pickaxes and shovels. This was to be the grim workforce extracting iron from the pre-war mines below; Lysander was checking over things for a second time, muttering to himself about potential yield and manpower expenditures. V was able to catch only a cursory glance at his clipboard, but it didn't look good; reports indicated casualties would be in excess of eighty percent due to unfavorable conditions in the mines below. \n\n V felt a pang of guilt at that; though the Possessed were not willingly there to begin with, it felt wrong to simply march them to their deaths like this. "Isn't there anything we can do to make sure less of them...perish?" V posited, Lysander's focus broke for a moment and he appraised her with a curious expression. \n\n "I suppose we could give them helmets, maybe a few radiation suits...but it would be costly, and we can always gather more workers." He returned his focus down to the clipboard, once again letting himself be lost in the numbers of it all. V felt conflicted over the matter, these had been people at some point and while controlling their minds was one thing, throwing their lives away with such carelessness was...another."

Any of the dirty work or labour was distributed among the Possessed.  And as the Choir grew in ambition—and in division, as the idea of building Mother brewed mixed opinions—the Dowagers began to entertain themselves with petty infighting. \n\n “It’s all the same with you Mother herders!  All so enamoured by this loose-ended goal that you’ve resorted to stealing from one of your own?”  A man decried.  “Barbarians!” \n\n “Barbarians?  You’re a childish insult-lobber who doesn’t understand how important Mother is to our prosperity!”  A woman rebutted.  “Such blasphemy.  It is a wonder you and your lot haven’t been labelled traitors!” \n\n “If that’s how you see it, then I’d rather be a traitor than a fool!” \n\n V had burst into the room, interrupting in time before guns were raised.  The man and woman turned to her, and in unison, while pointing at one another,  shouted: “PUNISH THIS HERETIC!” \n\n It took most of V’s willpower now to pop a blood vessel, and much more not to pop the bickerers.  “Enough fighting!”  She commanded.

  nf_chc.6.desc:0 "To V, the land heralded promise.  It was vast and devoid of nuisance debris, unlike most of their surroundings.  Rotten blueprints foretold that the land was prepped for a factory decade before the bombs.  Though why the factory was left in concept remained speculation, the Choir rejoiced—the schematics had survived, saving them the effort.  All they needed was to begin construction. \n\n But Celestina was awfully quiet as they surveyed the grounds.  Celestina had been a force of stabilisation for V over the years.  Her gentleness held power.  She handled turmoils with ease.  Celestina read people like sheets of music, all methodological and timely.  So if Celestina, in all her grace, gazed upon the field with unease, then that meant something. \n\n “What’s wrong?”  V asked once they found a moment alone. \n\n “The field is loud,” Celestina replied in her breathy voice.  Her gaze was interlocked with the space in front of her.  Before V could question what that meant, she continued, “Simple fields are quiet chimes.  Radiation pockets are like metronomes.  Sometimes four-four, sometimes eight-eight.  They tick, warning fools away.  But here—” she inhaled, “it’s a wailing string that never ends.” \n\n V speculated the worst, “A grave?” \n\n Finally, Celestina turned to her.  “For many.  I think they were before us; a Choir silenced before the bombs.  We have no right to build upon their resting place.” \n\n “We need this factory.  This is for nothing but our survival,” V stressed.  “And dead is dead—beyond our control.  There’s little we can do to mend their lingering grief.” \n\n “I know,” Celestina frowned.  “The factory is important, but I implore you to at least build around the burials.” \n\n “I’ll... I’ll think about it,” V relented, knowing well her decision would not bode well with everyone."

Half of it had sunken into the ground, the wood caked in moss and half-rotted.  Omma found peace there.  Every day for hours she sat by the gazebo nursing a rhapsody.  The gazebo had become a caution to all—there was no one daring enough to risk entering within Omma’s vicinity when she sang. \n\n For a woman scorned—left to experiments by her husband, and then left again soon after to be forgotten—was a woman feared. \n\n Strangely today, V spotted an individual walking up to the gazebo.  A fresh thrall?  Suicidal?  Both?  She wasn’t sure, but upon closer inspection the silhouette was clearer; power armour.  V clicked her tongue as she made to the exit in a sprint.  The wicked never rest, it seemed, not even those disguised in sheens of valour. \n\n Luckily, Paladin Ambrose wasn’t the overtly stubborn sort.  “What are you doing?”  V asked, hushed. \n\n “That woman.  She challenged me,” Ambrose replied, his gaze steadied on Omma.  “She calls me danger, disgracing my name with the actions of my forefathers—that of which, I have her know, I yearn to break free from.”"

Surprisingly, the mirror stayed intact; caked by centuries of grime and finger prints of yore.  V had never owned a mirror before.  She had asked Morgana what to do with it, to which the stylist quipped; “Admire and awe”. \n\n So, in the moments before their first strike against the Confederation, V sat in front of the vanity and stared. \n\n She wondered when the admiration or awe would set in. \n\n Lysander had estimated that the war against the Confederation would end sooner before a candle could burn to the stem of the wick.  His predictions saw no contest in the recent months after their success in swaying the Choir to Mother’s favour.  Confidence in one’s taskmaster was something to rejoice, but no good news or success could stifle the gnawing dread that had festered in V’s abdomen.  And with each day she felt it swell—eating away at her nerves and bones. \n\n V thought it was a tumour, but the prognosis turned up nothing.  If Celestina were still here, she’d figure out the ailment in due time.  if Dawn were around, she’d no doubt treat it with the utmost delicate care.  Before V’s thoughts could dwell to Ambrose she shook her head violently, burying her face in her hands. \n\n “Raise your chin, child,” Mother’s voice rang in the back of V’s mind.  “Leaders keep their eyes forward.” \n\n V obliged, peering at her reflection once more.  Red-eyed and tousled—she could barely recognize herself.  She blinked.  Once.  Twice.  Thrice.  Hold.  Open.  The image in the glass numbed her spine; familiar faces she thought she buried loomed behind her.  Choking back a scream, V smashed the glass with her fist.

I’ve circumvented these sorts of misunderstandings before.” \n\n Valiant and oblivious, which was putting it lightly.  Great.  “Why don’t you stay here?” V offered tentatively.  “I’ll talk to her, and then we’ll see about this whole thing.” \n\n “A mediator?”  Chuckled Ambrose.  “You can try, but I remain certain in my intent to approach, miss V.” \n\n Cautiously, V brisked her way over to Omma.  But the frail woman had always been vigilant.  She spoke before V had a chance to open her mouth; “I do not trust the Brotherhood—” Her voice a ghastly whisper that rumbled the grounds.  “And certainly not that Paladin, no matter what he claims.  I’ve seen enough to have seen it all; the bitterness in what one claims virtue.” \n\n Omma stared directly at V, all the while she could feel Ambrose’s burning gaze behind her.

Someone had painted the words "NO HOPE!" across the window in thin black lettering, aptly describing how V felt about the argument unfurling behind her. \n\n"Yes, well, think about how pathetic they look! They should appear deadly, frightening! Just the sight of weapons should make our enemies tremble, Dawn!" Morgana declaimed, casting down a pitiful gaze towards her impromptu debate partner. \n\nDawn stomped a foot on the ground, kicking up the thin layer of dust that had settled on the floor of the foreman's office. "We can make them safer, they're dangerous! They're more likely to blow your hands off than..the...enemy's....heads."

They worked with no sense of craftsmenship, no feelings of pride, and no eye for quality. Everything that came off the line was disappointing; brittle blades, sticky receivers, dull spears, and unwieldy pistols. It would have to do for now. The only silver lining was that the whole project had costed a bit less material than initially predicted, leaving a surplus lying about. Unforunately, the others had caught wind of this, leading both Morgana and Dawn to barge onto the worksite, demanding the extra material be used for their devices. \n\nMorgana wanted the weapons to look more imposing, to contribute positively to that all important image she constantly obsessed over; that meant more useless cosmetic attachments and purple paint. Dawn, on the other hand, wanted them to be a touch less unreliable; she justified it with some excuse about lowering the burden on medical supplies, but V wasn't buying it. No, Dawn had a soft heart for the Possessed, and this was her trying to get V to improve their lot in life. \n\nThere were merits to both arguments, and favoring one wouldn't hurt the war effort; this was a matter of personal choice.

No, lesser psykers would lead warbands to purge the rest of the holdouts. With Lysander at her side, V was currently tasked with sorting through the many hundreds of captured tribals rounded up after the conflict ended. It was a fairly simple process; captured warriors were made into soldiers, sturdy folk were made into laborers. The old and the infirm would be ignored; they were too weak to rise up, their end was soon, and they weren't fit for Mother. \n\nMother. Mother was the real reason V had to be here, to hand pick the finest from the tribe to be §Rsubsumed.§! Having grown somewhat picky, Mother wanted only the best; chieftans, warrior-poets, scholars, arificers, and those in peak physical condition. As the grim procession moved along, V would occasionally hear Mother's raspy whispers making demands from back of her mind; she was a grisly oracle seperating prime candidates from the pack."

The chosen would invariably cry out in their native tongue for help, and they would invariably be silenced by a club, or a whip. \n\nEventually, a young boy –no older than sixteen– passed her, his gaze cast to the floor. He looked strong, well fed; had he been allowed a future he might have one day matured into a powerful warrior, or a driven laborer. The sickly sweet voice of V's matron called out again, her demands for his §Rflesh§! bouncing around inside her skull. She simply raised a finger at the boy and he was pulled from the line. \n\nHe was unusually silent. The regular anguished wails came from someone else, this time! It was an older looking woman with tears streaming down her mature face as she jostled in her shackles, calling out to the boy. V didn't speak their language, but she could interpret her words. The woman was this boy's mother, and she was realizing that she'd never see him again. \n\nV paused, suddenly struck with painful memories of being whisked away from her parents by people in labcoats. The tribal woman's face shifted horribly, her features twisting and contorting into a blurred approximation of V's own mother. The sight of it made V want to puke. \n\nThe panic was cut short by Lysander seizing a baton from one of the thralls and letting out a yell. "That's enough out of you, savage!" He slammed the implement into her chest, the collision with her ribs made a sickening crack; she doubled over, her screams reduced to mere groans and whimpers. \n\nThe boy had long been lead away, deprived of even a farewell to his kin. \n\nV, having returned to a present mind, realized she was sweating."

V really didn't like being left in the dark, and was as a result fairly nervous about what the meeting would entail. \n\nThe jig was up the moment she entered his office, the furniture had been rearranged to facilitate a game of chess. The board, the pieces, and a bottle of prewar wine sat together on a coffee table. Two chairs sat opposing eachother on either side of the table, both comfortable looking things with a rich scarlet furnishing. \n\nLysander was facing away from the door, gingerly laying a record down onto...something.

It was unlike Omma to approach with small talk, no less strike up a conversation.  “I suppose,” she said.  “We came here for metal and flesh.  It’s all abundant.

January stood to the side, typing away at a connected terminal, checking over last minute readings. \n\nThe mainframe of Project ACAPELLA reminded her of a tree. The large, central stalk glistened with running lines of mystical energy. Lights blinked in arcane sequences along branches that stretched out from the trunk, connecting to smaller mainframes that lined the walls. The metal oval of the control pod was nestled amongst root-like conglomerations of wires. It struck her simultaneously as being like an egg, fallen from a nest and cracked, and a rabbit hole, dug into the base of a tree, leading mysterious places. \n\nAt the base of the coffin-esque pod, there was a little metal drawer. It would be sealed in with V, and was big enough to hold a few personal effects. In it, her friends left gifts. \n\nAmbrose left his holotags, so that he may always be there to protect V. \n\nDawn left a deer statue carved out of wasteland wood, to remind V of how far the world will have come when it is healed. \n\nCelestina left a few postcards of pre-war national parks, to remind V how far yet there still is to go. \n\nFinally, after all the gifts had been left, and the drawer was sealed, V gave each of her friends a hug and some parting words. It was a long affair, filled with teary goodbyes and genuine well wishes, but it could not last forever. \n\nV stepped into the pod, laying back on the soft, cushiony bed; V clutched in her arms her gift to herself, her favorite book of poems. \n\nV nodded dutifully at January, the sequence began, the pod sealed, and V was put to sleep, forever."

The air felt lighter, it stung the lungs just a touch less than it normally did. That familiar sickly glow the light took as it filtered through contaminated clouds was just a bit less green. \n\nNo ticking geiger counters, angry wastelander beasts, or sounds of distant gunfire. All they could hear...was birds. \n\nAlready, it seemed, the Project was beginning to work.

"Bet your hands are getting sore." \n\nV just grunted, striking it again. This time the majority of the sparks landed, and the kindling started to ember! V excitedly leaned in, cupping her hands near them and feeding the fire with measured huffs. It flickered, wavered, darkened...and then took hold! \n\nThere it was, a genuine fire feasting away on the spread of kindling. V carefully fed twigs and sticks into it, nuturing the blaze until it was hungry enough for logs of wood, which she gave readily. \n\nDawn, having finally finished pitching the tent, regarded the fire with a congratulatory cheer and a short applause. "Hey, you did it! Now let's go gather something to eat, I'm starving." \n\nA hearty meal of bird eggs, berries, and wasteland fish followed ending in the two happy campers settling in for the night. V had complained about being dragged along a dirty old pre-war camping trail earlier, but now she realized that a little time spent amongst nature was actually quite nice. It felt right, like she was coming to terms with some primal human condition. \n\nDawn shifted, sitting cross-legged and planting her palms in the dirt. "I think we should do this more often, maybe a few times a year?" \n\nV nodded, guilt settling in her stomach like a stone. She'd not say it, but she wasn't certain how many years she had left, before... \n\nNo. Shouldn't worry about that tonight. There are more important matters at hand, like letting Dawn explain what a "s'more" is."

I worry for the day some brute decides to drop his guns and run straight at you.” \n\n V blinked.  “I would just use my powers to defend myself, then.” \n\n Ambrose turned to her, his smile unfaltering, as if he anticipated that response.  “Hypothetically, what if they caught you by surprise and aimed for your windpipe?” \n\n That would hinder her ability to use her powers, sure.  “That sounds extremely hypothetical,” V countered. \n\n “Or what if it was—” he lurched forward dramatically, “a sudden betrayal?” \n\n “No one near us would do that.” \n\n “V, I could run up to you right now and snap your neck, and you would not have the heart to stop me.” \n\n “You couldn’t possibly—” \n\n “It just takes five seconds,” Ambrose deadpanned."

She had avoided thinking about the future beyond ACAPELLA, choosing to embrace what moments she had left.  It had just occurred to her that everyone else was deep in dreams about bright futures.  All of which included her.  \n\n “You know what?”  She shook her head.  “Sure.” \n\n Ambrose’s smile widened.

Celestina was listing off tips to V while adjusting her posture, her gaze, and her clothes. \n\n"Why can't you just go to these talks yourself...?" V was worried, she'd gotten used to diplomacy amongst the various psykers in the clan, but talking with outsiders was...different, especially the folk in the Big Spend. \n\n"Because YOU are in charge, you're going to be our leader, and you need to be able to represent us." Celestina replied authoritatively, her husky voice was laced in a beautifully calm confidence. \n\nV didn't have the heart to tell her that, no, she wouldn't be in charge for much longer. That none of this training really mattered... \n\nWell, maybe it did? Maybe V ought to be able to confront death with a bit of proper tact. \n\n"I think you're ready. Go out there and say hello, I'll be right beside you." \n\nV nodded, coming out from behind the large caravan truck the two had been driven to the meeting place in. \n\nThe Chickasaw diplomat was a well built, educated looking man who glanced between the psykers suspiciously.

It was the first step in a long line of things building up trust with the locals here. \n\nV felt a minor pang of guilt. The war had been necessary, right? It would have been a poor idea to simply let the warlike Dyed-Blood rule over Painted Rock...but it still felt worryingly violent to topple the whole tribe over and install themselves. \n\nIt'd be a fine line to walk, but hopefully it could be done such that they wouldn't just win battles in the fields, but in the hearts and minds as well."

Who could tell? \n\nCelestina blinked slowly in response.  “You might have a point.” She glanced over to V. “Ah, great timing.” \n\n“For?” V finally stepped into the room. \n\n “Whether Dawn and I’s powers have any overlap,” explained a, pursing her lips.  “I don’t know how we stumbled upon this topic, either.” \n\n“What we can do share the same veins.  The only difference is intelligence, or so Celestina says,” Dawn continues.  “In this case, intelligence is like frequencies.  Animals—and I love them—have little brains that give off frequencies only my ears can pick up, which I can interpret through song.  It’s the same case for Celes but for humans!’ \n\n“Which leads to the question; is there a creature with intelligence within the realm of both human and animal standards?”  Questioned Celestina. “And if we can interpret the same emotions from it, then our theories would be true."

V startled back, exclaiming, “Have you been carrying that this entire time?” \n\n “This is Pudge.  He’s very polite and very intelligent,” cooed Dawn, dismissing the question, as she patted the mole rat's head.  “He likes the shade and sleeps clung to my back.” \n\n “I did sense another song flowing parallel to yours...” professed Celestina. \n\n “Intelligence!”  Dawn smiled.  “Here, why don’t we place Pudge beside V and see if our readings of both are alike!” \n\n V narrowed her eyes, “What did you just imply?” \n\n “Hush now,” chimed Celestina, who inhaled deeply.  V tossed aside her indignance and obliged.  “Think of something that makes you feel happy, then cling onto it.” \n\n Dawn leaned in to sing to Pudge, assumingly asking the animal the same question.  She stepped back to Celestina’s side, nodding. \n\n “Let’s start with Pudge.”  Celetina’s eyes fluttered shut, the crease between her brows the only crack in her pristine complexion.  “Dawn, on the count of three, we will both say what we feel he is thinking of.”"

What made her happy?  Without a doubt, an image painted in her head; the Choir.  But as she held onto the image of her friends, the fear lurking in the back of her mind resurfaced.  The inescapable fact—her sacrifice for a verdant world \n\n V swallowed that dark thought down; she had gotten better at mental fortitude.  Celestina didn’t need to know. \n\n Three.  Two.  One. \n\n “We make you happy,” Celestina breathed, smiling. \n\n “ACAPELLA?”  Dawn said, one eye opened in uncertainty. \n\n V’s spine stiffened.  “It was, the, uh—Celestina’s right.” \n\n Dawn sighed, shoulders slumped, “I guess we need more testing before we can confirm there’s an overlap. \n\n Celestina patted Dawn’s shoulder.  “It was an excellent try.

She was the first like them to perish from the experiments, but her unbridled rage kept her bound to the material world, clinging to the soil and concrete they buried her under.  If love kept people going, then hatred kept the wicked thriving. \n\nIt was only then, when Dawn, Celestina, and V enacted Mother’s final purge, that they truly came face to face with contempt. \n\nMother’s rage rattled the walls of her chamber as the trio’s song stripped away at her effigy, rendering every shred of rotten flesh, shards of bone, and webs of tendon to ash.  Cracks lined the walls, spewing tangled lilac vines and budding thorns—almost as if a hidden network of tangly weeds was brought to light. \n\nSo they pulled to the root.  In the face of fear, Celestina grounded herself.  Every note she bellowed was emboldened by her dreams of a verdant future.  Dawn powered through, biting back her racking sobs to see their melody through.  V kept a steady pace, her powers both a reckoning force as well as protective; she kept them safe from the vines in the corner of their blindspots that threatened to lash out. \n\nAnd once the last vine shriveled to gray, there was silence.  Mother was no more.  Their breathless celebration was abruptly interrupted by the topple of bricks deeper within the chamber. \n\nCautiously they approached the source of the sound, and there they found it.

He left shortly after they were driven from Denver, deciding to seek the glory he was robbed of in the retreat from the city elsewhere. \n\nThe two of them were approaching an old service station, the only building for miles. As they stepped up to the front, figures jumped out from doors, corners, and peeked up from atop the roof. Most of them were wearing combat armor and wielding energy weapons. \n\nOne of the men, a male clad in battle-worn power armor marched out from behind the pumps, pointing a laser pistol right at V's head.

V only heard bits and pieces but it seems he'd saved a lot of lives during the short campaign in Denver. \n\nThe Bunker was in actually fairly good condition; the expedition had spent the last year or so refurbishing it into a proper headquarters for their operations, and that meant lots of turrets, robots, security, and stiff looking people in power armor. \n\nAfter what seemed like wandering through a dozen hallways, the two finally arrived at the office of Paladin Commander Andrea Brixley, who greeted them with an apprehensive but polite smile. \n\n"Greetings Paladin Ambrose, and hello to..."

Frayed tapestries draped from the rotting rafters.  The floor, though still browned and cakey from centuries of guck, possessed a subtle sheen—it was clean as one can get with abraxo cleaner-infused water.\n\nFor the first time in a while, home had made V uncomfortable in her own skin.  The night called for an evening of “dressed to impress.”  Or, as Morgana put it, “a time to recognize the riches we’d procure over the years with splendor.”\n\nA celebration made sense; a boost to morale and to commemorate the times, but the strange dress Morgana had put together for her did not.  The dress was itchy—the hems biting at V’s knees and shoulder blades—and sorely unfit for the midnight chill.  But Morgana was enraptured.  She gasped as V walked into the purview of the rest of the Choir.  Omma sat quietly at the table, picking away at the plate of food served by a Possessed.  Lysander was to the side entertaining a circle of dowagers with charming declarations of future prospects and of his devotion to Mother.\n\n“You look stunning in it!
