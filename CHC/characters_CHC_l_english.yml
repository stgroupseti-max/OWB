#Character Descriptions
CHC_Mother_desc:0 "The Unbidden Spirit. The Psychic Emanation. The Siren. The Putrescent Mother. All names given to the foul psychic spirit that has haunted the choir since the very day the bombs fell. Speaking from the shadows, in whispers that scratch at the back of the mind, her desires have always been clear. \n\n"Construct for me a form. A body to inhabit. A vessel to hold my vast energies, my very spirit. Construct it from the flesh of outsiders, dissidents, and naysayers. Do this for me, and I will grant you agency over the world like you have never known before." \n\nAnd so, they did. The Choir devoted many years and many more lives to seeing this vision true. Wastelanders harvested from all across Oklahoma were subsumed into the grim monument to their guiding spirit. In those days, the tribe was lead by another; a woman who's name was lost to history, cast into the void almost immediately after Mother was made complete. \n\n Now, Mother rules from her palace, a massive monument dedicated to housing a psychic monarch two stories tall. The entire place is a putrid mix of gore and mindbending psychic ooze, all draped over whatever opulence can be salvaged from the fallen world.\n\nHer decrees are many, every one of them sent through the minds of her psyhic thralls and every one of them more wicked than the last. She will not stop until the world has come to bear the brunt of her cruelty, driven by nothing more than the desire to manifest a deep personal malace. \n\n§0We know this much\nDeath is an evil;\nwe have the gods'\nword for it; they too\nwould die if death\nwere a good thing.§0"
CHC_ambrose_armistead_army_chief_desc:0 "§Y"I march forward for righteousness not defined by those who bore steel before me, but for righteousness of my own."§!\n\nPaladin Ambrose is a Brotherhood Veteran inside and out. If you can name an enemy of the Brotherhood, he can number how many he's slain in battle. Enclave, NCR, Raider, Chem-Fiend, Hangdog, Legionary, the list goes on and on. He's by no means a psychotic, though. Like many in the ranks of the brotherhood he sees killing as nothing more than an extension of duty, one that he has continually upheld since he's been holding a rifle.\n\nThat was, until the ill-fated Maxson Expedition arrived in Colorado. Swamped with issues from the very beginning, the expedition's time in Denver was short, and bloody. Complete leadership decapitation and dozens of good soldiers lost trying to defend their meager citadel in Denver. This disaster deeply unsettled Ambrose who shortly after packed his belongings and left the brotherhood, wandering east in the same fashion as a Hedge Knight, until fating upon Omma, and being captured by the Choir.\n\n§YTo humbler functions, awful Power!\nI call thee; I myself commend\nUnto thy guidance from this hour;\nOh, let my weakness have an end!\nGive unto me, made lowly wise,\nThe spirit of self-sacrifice;\nThe confidence of reason give;\nAnd in the light of truth thy Bondman let me live!§!"
CHC_dawn_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§O"Have you ever just sat out in the grass, and looked up at the stars? If they were looking back, would they like what they saw?"§!\n\nPulled from an intellectual yet emotional distant family at a young age, Dawn was one of the later subjects to the clinical trials that created the Choir. Poorly socialized and averse to conflict, she spends most of her time in solitude amongst what remains of the natural world, just like she did before being taken in for experimentation.\n\nHer powers resonate most with animals, plants, and other non-human life; she's a green thumb, expert veterinarian, and discerning forager. Some even claim that she can communicate with animals themselves, but if that's true, it's not something she does around other people.\n\nHer worldview is absolutely pacifistic and lacking any sense of paternalism; this means in most arguments she ends up either a complete doormat, or simply failing to get her way, this only compounds her frustrations with other people and solidifies her desire to be away from them. Though, the few people that have managed to break through that distant, shy exterior have found that Dawn is both infinitely friendly and accommodating, if not a little strange.\n\n§OSlip on your frivolous shoes\nAnd dance with me. My soul\nIs the wild vine\nWho alone has grasped it,\nWho has seen through the awful plot,\nWho will arrive in time to vanquish\nThe river already heavy with blossoms,\nThe moon spilling light onto packs\nOf men. What is sadder than witless\nWolves, wind without borders,\nNationless birds, small gifts\nLaden with love’s intentions?§!"
CHC_v_army_chief_desc:0 "§R"§!§LA lifetime ago I resented isolation, the feeling of helplessness.§! §gIf only the younger V could see me now...§!§0"§!\n\nIndisputably the strongest in the Chained Choir, V's power is unquestioned and can sway not only those who follow her with words but can back it up with her strength, intellect, and psychic abilities. When she gives an order, it is followed. When she is threatened, there is an army to back her up. And when she says that she will kill someone, she means it.§g\n\nThey that have power to hurt, and will do none,\nThat do not do the thing they most do show,\nWho, moving others, are themselves as stone,\nUnmoved, cold, and to temptation slow...§!"
CHC_lysander_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§1"Carry the two... Move the barracks here... Offload materials in Waynoka... Yes, I know we'll reach our quota on time."§!\n\nLysander, like most first generation psykers, is a man from a much earlier time. A pre-war real estate mogul, Lysander lived a life entirely focused around doing good business; good for his pocketbook, anyhow. His biggest break came in 2065, when a freak year long tornado seasons made prime real estate dirt cheap. But what do you do when you've made more money than you could ever spend over a regular lifetime?\n\nWhy, you extend your lifetime, of course.\n\nThrough connections built in the business world, Lysander came to know of an experiment that could bring out latent psionic talent in people, with the added side effect of immortality. Interested more in living forever than in whatever meager powers the science could bring out in a man of his advanced age, he bought his way into the project at a price so steep he still winces at the thought of it.\n\nBut it worked, and just a few months before the bombs fell, Lysander had cheated God.\n\nIn present day he is Mother's most dutiful administrator, constantly shaving costs, pinching pennies, and helping her worldly affairs run as soon as possible. He is utterly devoted to bringing her into the physical world, some would even say a bit -too- devoted. Rumors abound why he wasn't chosen as her Oracle in light of V, but it's likely down to a lack of people skills and poor psychic powers. Still, he makes running an evil spirit worshipping cult look easy.\n\n§1When we were born with no possession.\nThe love received was our concession.\nNo worries, no fears, no troubles, no fuss.\nIn mother’s arms we put our trust.\n\nBut as we grew, we looked and craved,\nand all too soon became enslaved.\nThe more we saw, the more we wanted.\nOur quest for more became undaunted.§!"
CHC_morgana_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§0"You're going out in —that?— If I knew better, I'd say you were doing it just to rile me up!"§!\n\nPrim, proper, passionate, and completely patronizing. Morgana was born to parents who chased after aesthetics; a fashion diva mother, and a wartime propagandist father, the two of them sought absolute perfection from both their craft, and their daughter. Endless lectures on the importance of stature, presentation, tone, and all other manner of things instilled in her at a young age an important lesson; Things are not always as they seem, but how they seem is all that matters.\n\nThis guiding principle drives her in all things; designing impressive uniforms for Possessed soldiers, sketching beautiful inscriptions to be laid across the sides of weaponry, throwing lavish balls and parties for the Choir itself, even drafting designs for wonderful gowns, dresses, and hats for Mother to wear when her body is finally... complete.\n\nTo Morgana, morality is skin-deep, those who pursue an impressive and magnificent image -are- morally pure; while those who neglect to care for their presentation are morally repugnant.\n\n§0Say not of Beauty she is good,\nOr aught but beautiful,\nOr sleek to doves’ wings of the wood\nHer wild wings of a gull.\n\nCall her not wicked; that word’s touch\nConsumes her like a curse;\nBut love her not too much, too much,\nFor that is even worse.§!"
CHC_celestina_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§t"Diplomacy is one part getting the things you want, and one part making them like it."§!\n\nCelestina is an empath in every sense of the word. The eldest of five siblings, Celestina was always the family's homemaker in lieu of an absent mother; this commitment to caring for her family made her a talented caretaker and tuned her in to emotional support at a very young age. Time were tough though, and any promise of a little extra money meant a lot to Celestina; causing her to sign on with the same project that would have her separated from her family, and imbued with psychic powers.\n\nAlong with the regular host of musically casted psychic powers, Celestina was blessed with an increased sense of empathy. Not just the ability to understand or consider other's emotions, but the genuine ability to -feel- them on command. Such an edge makes her both an expert negotiator and counsellor. Whether you're bluffing at the debate table or trying to shield your traumas, there is no hiding from her insight into your soul.\n\n§tIf I can stop one heart from breaking,\nI shall not live in vain;\nIf I can ease one life the aching,\nOr cool one pain,\nOr help one fainting robin\nUnto his nest again,\nI shall not live in vain.§!"
CHC_omma_high_command_desc:0 "§0"I hope today will be quiet."§!\n\nCamilla ‘Omma’ Nowak was a profound classical singer before the war. She was famous for her vocal range and emotional performances.  Many of her shows left her audience breathless, her voice lingering with them all through the day, night, and even in their dreams. In her late sixties, years of straining her vocals to reach monthly quotes caught up with Camilla, and she was forced to retire. Retired life was peaceful, but nothing could fill the stage-yearning hole in her heart.  It was then a duo of researchers paid her a visit and a pitch; an experimental project that could give her a chance to restore her vocal chords. The terms and conditions were not far from shoddy, but she accepted with her husband’s encouragement.\n\nMisfortune soon followed. The project’s many trials and rows of medications left her worse for wear. Her husband would visit less and less, his attention stolen by a younger woman not bedridden as she. When she sang, things broke. People got hurt. After the bombs, Camilla resurfaced as an echo of what once. A destructive, heartbroken echo, whose song could crumble building foundations and bring audiences to their knees.\n\n§0The mystery which binds me still --\nFrom the torrent, or the fountain --\nFrom the red cliff of the mountain --\nFrom the sun that 'round me roll'd\nIn its autumn tint of gold --\nFrom the lightning in the sky\nAs it pass'd me flying by --\nFrom the thunder, and the storm --\nAnd the cloud that took the form§!\n§4(When the rest of Heaven was blue)§!\n§ROf a demon in my view –§!"
CHC_the_nightcaller_army_chief_desc:0 "§0"Welcome to Wonderland, Alice..."§!\n\nThough its proper form is unknown to most, the stories are consistent, with fear of the temptation to sleep when the Choir sings at night. It starts with sounds that make you jump as you try to close your eyes, you call out for a response, but there is no answer. That isn't abnormal for the wasteland, and it's probably a good thing that there is no response. It was just an animal or the rustling of the wind. You try to drift off back to sleep, but now you hear your name called out in the voice of an old friend or distant relative long forgotten, it calls out to you, and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up as you hear shouting and begging, unable to focus on the moment you may try to force yourself to sleep and that is when the absolute nightmare begins.\n\nThe song slowly seeps into the dreams; you see everyone you've ever known tortured in front of your eyes, unable to do anything; you watch your life and everything you love ripped away from you, and then you finally see It. More monster than human, its grotesque body attempts to mirror normal human posture but then reverts to erratic movement, slowly inching closer to you while you are stuck in a frozen stance, unable to do anything. Suddenly it's right on top of you, its pale, wrinkled skin almost contrasting with the darkness, many eyes open across its body, all focusing on you, and its mouth falls open, exposing many daggers for teeth. It salivates and breathes heavily before taking a bite out of your neck. You awake to scream, unable to fathom what happened and not wanting to return. You were a victim of it, The Nightcaller.\n\nMany stories have been attributed to Soren, a Psyker who rarely leaves the depths of Watonga Correctional Facility. Although the terrors he brings to each person aren't the same, he has a unique way of finding what terrorizes them the most and enacting that fear on them unsympathetically. All are consistent in the victim experiencing intense nightmares of some kind before being driven insane, many afraid of going to sleep, and paranoid of those around them. Most recover eventually, and most end up as the possessed among the Choir. But those who don't spread the story of the man you meet after midnight, if they don't go completely insane, that is. Eventually, it became widespread enough that the name "The Nightcaller" had made its way back to the abyss of Watonga, a title that Soren took on with pride.§1\n\nNow I lay me down to sleep,\nI pray the Lord my Soul to keep\nIf I should die before I 'wake,\nI pray the Lord my Soul to take.§!"
CHC_robert_hardy_army_chief_desc:0 "§O"You can no more win a war than you can win an earthquake."§!\n\nOnce a part of the United States Armed Forces long before the Great War brought about the new world, Robert Hardy fought to protect the people of his country from foreign invaders. Still, it was all in vain. After the fighting on America's mainland had concluded, many leading nations launched their nuclear arsenals at each other, sinking the world into an abyss of everlasting fire and chaos. Rather than settle their differences peacefully, they resorted to bickering and fighting over the last of the earth's resources. However, not only did America fuel the fires of war, but they could have aided in calming them had they only shared their advances in Nuclear Fission with the rest of the world.\n\nOver 200 years later, Hardy is left with a reminder of the old world every time he sees his reflection, gaunt, aged, and wrinkly with his scorched skin and aching joints, all reminders of who he was and how he had to live with the mistakes of the nation he fought to protect. Some would say he was one of the lucky ones, but when he found himself a survivor of the blasts and with no one in his family left alive, he didn't think so. The only people he did have left were those of the Oklahoma national guard, but he found himself at odds with the grey morality that the new world brought along with them one too many times and decided to set out on his own.\n\nThen, he found himself allured to the song, drawing him into the Choir's lands, where he met a sage, a girl singing a duet with the birds while picking a bouquet of wasteland flowers. He talked with her. She spoke about how all life is precious and that through good deeds, the world could become a better place, and mother nature could grace the earth with her gifts once more. He was convinced and decided to stay with the Choir willingly so that he could echo these same beliefs.\n\n§OFighting, death, destruction, take.\nGuns, bullets, bombs, and hate.\nOf all these things I do abhor,\nSo please make love and never war.§!"
CHC_incineratus_army_chief_desc:0 "§P"Those who live without a great fire in their soul live in darkness."§!\n\nA beast that can barely be called human, with a calculated mind. Incineratus strikes fear through his name and cherishes it. He was born under another name long ago, along with his brother, but it has since been lost to time. His origins have become a legend, stories to scare those away from the Choir’s enchanting song. All that is known paints him as more of a myth than reality. However, a legend is not dangerous, but Incineratus is. His mystery extends even to the Choir, with the knowledge of what lies beneath his veil reserved only for Blaseus, who is of mind not sound enough to provide a reliable account. The only visible marks of his humanity are his eyes, which themselves resonate with a level of uncanniness, glazed pearls darting from point to point.\n\nNobody understands Incineratus better than himself. While the mystique is amusing at most times and makes for good character, it drives him awry on occasion. Without forewarning, he'd be gone in the dead of night, traveling off to an unknown destination. For weeks, his chamber often sat silent, anticipating his return. Rather than becoming the scourge of a town or village, he’d become its shadow. A lone watchman, observing with inaction. Even on the rare incursion with the odd vagrant, or misstepping traveler, he found himself pleasant. The side of him that many knows are only that of a strange man who spoke flowery and had a wit that put the mind at ease.\n\nAt a time, his kinder side showed brighter than all other of the Pyrodancers. His excursions grew in number and the span of them even further. It had reached a point where entire months were going by with no word from the head Pyrodancer. A plan was soon set, and he would not be alone upon his next journey.\n\nBlaseus stalked between the cold moonlit deserts and the wavering pines. Like a starved hound, he stalked his prey for countless nights. Once Incineratus settled, his pursuer followed, finding perch in a tree. After his rise from the subsequent morning dew, Incineratus sighted the people he’d been following so closely, burning ash. He returned to the Choir the next day, but a piece of his soul wavered. He showed light through the darkness, only to cast its glare onto people and watch them burn away. His sorrow faltered, but the memory has always remained. The solace he once found in himself was gone, and it would never return."
CHC_blaesus_high_command_desc:0 "§P"People tell me I have a very unique way of lighting up the room. ha! ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! HA! HA!"§!\n\nWhile the fire of youth tempered the mind of his brother, Blaesus wasn’t as fortunate. His mind is blank except for his enthrallment in all things inferno. Much to the ire of those living within the Choir’s reach, he’s very talented. Through his powers of Telepyrosis, he can shoot flames far beyond the average Pyrodancer’s reach. From even a mile away, Blaesus can spread the Choir’s terror entirely through his desire. Despite being a prominent member, the Choir doesn’t prefer him much either. If it wasn’t for his good-seeking brother, he’d have been removed long ago, left to be just another urchin combing the wastes.\n\nDespite the toils of the best surgeons and doctors, his mind remains shallow at best. While the Choir’s song still enchants him, he never takes part. If it’s because he knows no harmony or would rather listen instead doesn’t matter. His mongrel nature and wretchedness would lead none to wish upon his chants. After all attempts to repair his current state ended in futility, he earned use as a tormentor instead. While the better part of the Choir retained their basic integrity, Blaesus never had such restraint. This allows him to carry out his cruelties with impunity at the command of higher powers.\n\nHe answers to few, sometimes not even himself. His mind is dull and more so evil. There’s no end to the pejoratives that can be applied to his character, for he is nothing but raw, untamed wickedness, and that’s all he ever will be."
CHC_jimmy_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§P"You see the number on this jumpsuit? That's right motherfucker, I AM NUMBER ONE! Jimmy is the best!"§!\n\nThe purge of the Metalbenders was done swiftly and out of absolute ego. Jimmy's life never had ever been at stake or hinted at being threatened. Yet, he willed his powers into the deaths of all his peers, ensuring his already forthright existence. He was the last and was spared since his death would seal the fate of his ability's further use. Truth be told, he's always been a liar, cheat, and coward. However, Jimmy will always be number one.\n\nBefore joining the Choir, Jimmy found himself a traveling swindler and conman. With a scheme running from New Vegas to Santa Fe, he accumulated a small fortune using his powers. The trick wasn't to just bend spoons, one of his few "real" skills; it was to pull the coins right out of one of his target's pockets. While some hapless victim jabbered on, gently through the air trailed Nickle after Dime into some hideaway place. He liked "performing" in Legion territory, the people were dumber, and Denarius was easier to get a hold of than caps. Legend has it that he even tricked the strong and mighty Lanius out of every coin he had, but that's neither here nor there. However, all good things must end, which Jimmy soon found once he ventured too close to the Choir's song. Word had reached them that there was a man who could morph and manipulate metal by just using his mind, so they sent their taskmaster to validate these claims.\n\nHendrix stepped into a dank and grimy New Mexican bar in the late afternoon; before he made another step, he'd already been pulled aside and given an entire spiel over the power of the mind and the different shapes the little man could twist the fork into. He carried Jimmy upon his shoulder for quite some time, waking him only to feed and provide clean water before knocking him out cold again. Once they finally arrived, Jimmy was introduced to his peers and given a room. Despite being surrounded by dozens like him, he couldn't help but feel special. They'd looked out specifically for him, having walked all that way just to find him and bring him here. Jimmy indeed was of great use to them. Then the paranoia set in... was he going to be here forever? Why was he even here? Those questions remained unanswered, for Jimmy killed them out of raw emotion rather than take action and find his own answers.\n\nJimmy couldn't just be number one. He had to be the only one. §RNo more would suffice...§!"

CHC_carmen_air_chief_desc:0 "§Y"You play with lightning, I control it."§!\n\nWhile the Choir has very few planes to speak of, Carmen does enjoy hang-gliding and occasionally parachuting out of Engelbert's "Jolly Roger." Gliding down from the sky like a one-winged angel of death, bringing with her the wrath of the Choir. Her powers allow her to manipulate currents in the wind, even affecting the weather, sometimes calling upon great storms without warning. The enemies of the Choir have been caught off guard more than a couple of times, thanks partly to Carmen.\n\nThanks to the Chained Choir, Carmen has been able to hone both of her abilities. She is indebted to them and has no other place to call home, so she will fight to keep the place she calls home afloat and the enemy flooded in the tsunami of her anger.\n\n§YThe flash of light across the sky\nwe watch and stare as time goes by\nin the coal black night\nthe white scar of the night.\n\nShines through the dark\nthe lightning leaves its mark\nonce the sun come bright\ninto the sky you see the damage in the light.§!"

CHC_bryce_navy_chief_desc:0 "§Y"Boats, like whiskey, are all good."§!\n\nOnce a member of the Scrapper Council, Bryce used what scrap he could scrouge to construct fishing vessels, selling them off to people to make a profit. He dreamed of one day restoring the PMV Lawson that the Scrappers used as their meeting place. Sailing the ocean destined to find some long-lost land to settle on with the scrappers, like the explorers you could read about in old books. Or perhaps they would take about fishing for large sea creatures, getting into a fierce battle directly with the monster, and losing a limb. There would be vows of vengeance, surely. But that sort of thing is for story books. Bryce really enjoys the restoration of the vessels and the satisfaction of parting the water with the ship. He lusts far more for the journey than the destination. However, Bryce knows that such a feat could not be achieved by his or the Scrappers alone.\n\nSo when the day came that such a meeting on the same ship was held again, he was surprised that a diplomat from a mysterious people had visited them to broker a deal for resources, scrap no less. She told stories of incredible feats and magic that her people could conjure and even demonstrated a little herself. Bryce was taken aback not only had he seen a magician in the flesh, but on the very ship that would require a magic trick to restore. He knew that what was happening could only be fate, just like in the stories he had heard. He jumped at the opportunity to proposition her with most of the scrap he had and the promise to show her people the ways of the waterways and the maintenance of the vessels that would carry them, in hopes that one day with their support, the Lawson would be restored and carried away on a river of melody straight to the ocean."
CHC_dawud_army_chief_desc:0 "§t"I know some magic as well, I am skilled at making things disappear in a blink of an eye."§!\n\nWhile not in the ownership of any apparent Psychic powers, Dawud has a knack for settling problems through subterfuge, which is a power in its own right. Alongside him, he has a trained cadre of possessed, psykers, and mercenaries under his command that are skilled in deception, assassination, thievery, and surveillance. There isn't much that goes unheard... or even unrepeated if Dawud is around. He is there to pull the trigger if someone needs to be killed. He is there with the cloth and water if they need to be interrogated. He is there with the binoculars if they need to be spied on. He is there in disguise if they need to be lied to.\n\nNot much is known about Dawud's past. Some whisper that he was a Circle of Steel agent from Texas who went AWOL after breaking some law written long ago. Others murmur that he is a Frumentarii sent from Ceasar's Legion to scout out the Chained Choir. Or perhaps, he was hired by one of the neighboring survivalists to infiltrate the Chained Choir and eliminate them as a threat in the region, but the song gradually made him forget his original mission. Regardless of what his true intentions are, Dawud found himself in his position by tracking down a rogue Psyker that was causing problems for the Choir and offered them up alive on a silver platter to V. In return, he swore allegiance to her, and she allowed him to become a part of her personal guard.\n\n§tEpisodic memory\nburned into my brain\nand replayed\ninvoluntary in flashes, sometimes amended\nto color, now.\nThe years have painted\nthe picture, but\nthe original remains.§!"
CHC_v_country_leader_good:0 "§W"It must seem daunting to walk into the darkness alone, but that's why we'll walk together."§!\n\nWhen the forced possessions stopped, and the sacrifices to Mother ended, V felt an enormous weight lifted from her shoulders, but she didn't have to make these decisions alone. She was helped along the way by Celestina and Dawn.\n\nYet it still feels as though she is missing something, as if there is something greater she could do to repay the debt owed to the people she caused so much pain. Perhaps there isn't a way to atone for what she did, but the path she could have continued down would undoubtedly cause more pain and suffering for those in the Choir and the people they would have hurt to accomplish their goals.\n\nWhatever it is she is missing, V knows that she'll be able to put one foot after the other with the help of her friends, and when the time is right, she'll be able to make the best decisions for the people who follow her.\n\n§WWe think about you always,\nwe talk about you still.\nYou have never been forgotten,\nand you never will.\nWe hold you close within our hearts\nand there you will remain,\nto walk and guide us through our lives.\nUntil we meet again.§!"
CHC_v_country_leader_bad:0 "§g"As head of the Choir, I expect you to accept my decree. If you don't, then I shall be forced to kill you and use your corpse to bring back our Putrescent Mother."§!\n\nThe 5th test subject of Watonga, the first successful one, FEV has kept her alive since the bombs dropped, essentially a mutant. Practical, intelligent, intense, but emotionally dull. Emotions imbalance her mentally and physically, so she often suppresses her true feelings to stay stable.\n\nNo one else has demonstrated more devotion to Mother than V has. She had not only taken the reigns as the First Chorister but led the Choir to where it is today. Because of her, the possessed are numerous, the Psykers are loyal, and Mother receives what she needs to be whole once more. Deep within the compound where V sits on her proverbial throne, she hears murmurs of excited voices encouraging her, complimenting her talents, and telling her that Mother will soon be with her again, and they will be together as one.\n\nUntil that day, V will remain the indisputable leader of the Choir and lead them onward towards their salvation, and no one will get in the way of that, not even her so-called friends.\n\n§gWe think about you always,\nwe talk about you still.\nYou have never been forgotten,\nand you never will.\nWe hold you close within our hearts\nand there you will remain,\nto walk and guide us through our lives.\nUntil we meet again.§!"
