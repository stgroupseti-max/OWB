 nf_gim_april.1.t:0 "Strangers Once Again"
 nf_gim_april.1.d:0 "The Dwarves of Silverforge are no strangers to feeling out of place, unlike their ancestors they have had to live on the surface surrounded by tall-folk. Unfortunately, not only do they find themselves in an unfamiliar environment, but a completely different time! As they gather their wits, they see before them a world changed by an unknowable catastrophe and new dangers presenting themselves every minute. There are benefits to this however, as the locals have begun to worship them, calling them their true kin. As they talk, it appears that something similar to the Day of Ashen Skies occurred here in this world, but with something called a 'Newk'. Even better, it seems the village is called Gimli and the locals claim to be Forgemasters! The humans have given complete control over to the Dwarves, wishing to not just revere, but learn from them. It all seemed like it was going to work, that is until the Dwarves saw the tools they had to work with."
 nf_gim_april.1.a:0 "'I've never seen such machinery!'"
 nf_gim_april.2.t:0 "Shiny New Toys"
 nf_gim_april.2.d:0 "It would appear the Dwarves are experts at using firearms, as apparently 'Point and Shoot' is a universal saying. More so, the Dwarves have begun to teach the locals to better utilize and improve their guns. Not only that, but the Dwarves insist they use a phalanx formation for reasons unknown to most. One thing is clear, the Dwarves love modern firearms and will no doubt use them to find their way in this strange, new world."
 nf_gim_april.2.a:0 "'These are so much better than what we had!'"
 nf_gim_april.3.t:0 "Where did the Hold go?"
 nf_gim_april.3.d:0 "Before being transported from their home, the Dwarves were working on building their very own hold. In fact they were nearly finished with it when they were ripped from their home and brought here. Most of the Dwarves are distraught over this, for it had taken them centuries to even get to that point. However, some Dwarves have suggested that instead of sitting in despair, they simply build a new hold here! They propose that with the help of the modern machinery and those from Gimli, the feat could be accomplished rather quickly. This would not mean it shall be an easy task, as they will still need a significant amount of resources to do so, and likely go to war for them."
 nf_gim_april.3.a:0 "'You're telling me we have to start over again?!'"
 nf_gim_april.4.t:0 "Surface Mines of Gimli"
 nf_gim_april.4.d:0 "One of the specialties of the Silverforge dwarves is their technical know-how to construct surface mines. They recall how before a strange war involving flowers in their homeland, they had sought to use surface mines due to a lack of resources. Not only have they offered to do the same here, but they seem eager to give it another try. The resources can be put towards either military equipment or our industry, we need only to pick."
 nf_gim_april.4.a:0 "We must ensure our security."
 nf_gim_april.4.b:0 "We could make some coin this way."
 nf_gim_april.5.t:0 "Silverforge's Finest"
 nf_gim_april.5.d:0 "Silverforge was home to what was considered the finest engineering and siege corps in Cannor. Now that they have modern firearms, it seems like a match made in heaven. While they are no longer besieging castles, they still believe that they can use their techniques to great effect on the battlefield. With no one opposing a dwarf with a big gun, it seems the Wasteland has to face the wrath of the Second Silverforge Siege Corps."
 nf_gim_april.5.a:0 "How large of a round can I fit into this thing?"
 nf_gim_april.6.t:0 "Invasion of the Obsidian Dwarves"
 nf_gim_april.6.d:0 "It all happened in the blink of an eye. As the first workers began to break the hard yet shiny layer of rock, something began to move on the otherside. Though at first believing it to simply be the shifting of the rubble, a hand suddenly appeared dragging one of them down. After that, complete chaos. What appeared to be dwarves covered in ash began pouring from the hole, enraged and bearing bloodied weapons. It only took a couple minutes for the rest of the hold to become aware of what had happened, but by then, thousands of these 'Obsidian' dwarves had taken the deepest level hostage. The access doors were sealed, and rapidly the rag tag milita of hold residents gathered at the entryway. While waiting on their orders, one dwarf noticed that the invaders on the otherside were chanting in the dwarven tongue, but could only make out one word, §c"Runefather"§!. It was then that the dwarves sat frightened while the men stood perplexed, but this did not change the fact that they had to face an unknown foe. After an hour, both enough men and dwarves had gathered and were ready to seal the breach, and as they opened the door to push back the invaders..."
 nf_gim_april.6.a:0 "They resisted the invaders at the cost of many lives."
 nf_gim_april.6.b:0 "The Obsidian dwarves overwhelmed them, and soon, the entire hold."
 nf_gim_april.6.c:0 "They fought with the dream of Aul-Dwarov."
 nf_gim_april.7.t:0 "Strange Layer of Rock"
 nf_gim_april.7.d:0 "While many have believed we reached the very depths of the hold, it appears this is not the case. One of the residents seems to have found a strange layer of rock in one of the tunnels at the very bottom of the hold. This rock gives off an unnatural sheen, and many have already wondered what to do about it. While some say we have gone far enough, a vocal minority has expressed their interest to continue the excavation. The rock has generated an obsession with some, and all that is left to do now is decide if it is worth the effort."
 nf_gim_april.7.a:0 "This will make us rich! Rock and Stone!"
 nf_gim_april.7.b:0 "Some things are best left untouched."
 nf_gim_april.91.t:0 "Expanding the Hold"
 nf_gim_april.91.d:0 "After months of preparation and building, the main foundation and outer structure has been completed. While relatively small now, it already has become the center for Silverforge's ambitions. As people begin to travel to Gimli to seek the hold's protection, it is clear that it will be a great boon for Silverforge. The dwarves are overjoyed and everyone is celebrating the success. What had been centuries in the making was coming to fruition, but there was one thing on everyone's mind. Now that the first level was complete, why stop there? Indeed, the dwarves had big plans for the hold. With their new machinery, they plan on making it one of the deepest holds ever. While tonight they celebrate, tomorrow they begin planning for the next level."
 nf_gim_april.91.a:0 "A true triumph for all"
 nf_gim_april.92.t:0 "Expanding the Hold"
 nf_gim_april.92.d:0 "Work on the second level has now been completed. As the hold becomes larger and larger, so too does its benefits. More space means more people and therefore more workers. The only worry now is that the deeper the hold goes, the harder it is to dig further. Thankfully, this hasn't become a problem quite yet, but should it expand much further, more resources will be needed."
 nf_gim_april.92.a:0 "It is beginning to take shape"
 nf_gim_april.93.t:0 "Expanding the Hold"
 nf_gim_april.93.d:0 "The third level is complete. Though the labor is very intensive, the dedication to the project hasn't waned. If anything, the deeper we go, the harder the dwarves work! In addition, each level we add increases the productivity of the hold in general. There has even been multiple new mead stands installed, though it is not safe for human consumption. It looks like the dwarves are turning a new corner."
 nf_gim_april.93.a:0 "Truly a thing of beauty, isn't it?"
 nf_gim_april.94.t:0 "Expanding the Hold"
 nf_gim_april.94.d:0 "With the fourth level complete, the hold has finally become a true marvel of engineering. Thanks to the cooperation between man and dwarf, the hold now has grown big enough to house most of Gimli's population. It has become a citadel, being extremely defensive while also housing most of the industry of Silverforge. The hallways span vast amounts of space, and even signs had to be put up warning the humans that they will get lost. Some are content with where the hold is at, but there is still room for improvement. If we truly wish to see the hold at its true potential, there is still work to do."
 nf_gim_april.94.a:0 "'I'm going to need a map to find my room!'"
 nf_gim_april.95.t:0 "Expanding the Hold"
 nf_gim_april.95.d:0 "Level five of the hold has been challenging, but it is finally finished. It would have been completed sooner if not for a hasty dwarf using more explosives than he should have. Thankfully, the damage was rather easy to repair and work quickly resumed. The hold now has enough space to fit even more residents and our production is through the roof. Not literally of course, at least as long as we keep stock of our explosives..."
 nf_gim_april.95.a:0 "'I am a dwarf...'"
 nf_gim_april.96.t:0 "Expanding the Hold"
 nf_gim_april.96.d:0 "The sixth level of the hold has just finished work. It is beginning to get hard to bring materials down and has slowed construction somewhat, but with all the new people coming in, there is no shortage of labor. Many can tell the final stages of the hold are nearing and this has driven them to work even harder. The next level will need a bit more time to ensure structural stability, but for now, we celebrate."
 nf_gim_april.96.a:0 "'And I'm digging a hole...'"
 nf_gim_april.97.t:0 "Expanding the Hold"
 nf_gim_april.97.d:0 "Level seven of the hold is now complete. The hold is now a labyrinth of corridors and hall ways that lead to many rooms, making it pretty difficult to traverse. Thankfully, a new department of Hold Safety and Security has been formed to help people find their way and ensure peace. There have already been way too many reports of drunken brawls, but for dwarves this is par for the course. A completely unrelated report says there has only been one death in the hold so far, though the circumstances are still a mystery to investigators."
 nf_gim_april.97.a:0 "'Diggy diggy hole...'"
 nf_gim_april.98.t:0 "Expanding the Hold"
 nf_gim_april.98.d:0 "Level eight is done. No one thought building a hold would be possible and now it reaches so far into the ground that many jest it will soon reach the center of the world. The halls stretch almost endlessly and so many live in the hold, there are individual governments on each level. It takes hours to walk from the top to the bottom, but the trip is almost like a pilgramage to some. While the thought of going deeper still lurks in the corner of the dwarves mind's, it is safe to say the hold is now truly complete. Balgar has smiled upon us in this new world and everyone knows he is watching over them."
 nf_gim_april.98.a:0 "'Diggy diggy hole!'"
 nf_gim_april.101.t:0 "Balgar's Successor"
 nf_gim_april.101.d:0 "Under the leadership of Erickson, the men of Gimli have done what the dwarves thought impossible. The hold has been completed and already reached a substantial size. While there is more room to expand, the dwarves are elated to live in someplace like home. They have begun calling Erickson "Balgar Reborn", and have even pledged to work harder to see their dream through."
 nf_gim_april.101.a:0 "'I shall not fail you, friends'"
 nf_gim_april.111.t:0 "Dug Too Deep"
 nf_gim_april.111.d:0 "While the Forgehold of Gimli has only been a member city of the Republic for a short time now, yet such is their skill with forging that considerable funds have flowed towards it. And what do they do with these caps? Dig ever deeper into the earth, in search of wealth and safety. Today news has come in that the digs have found something inconceivable: another civilization...."
 nf_gim_april.111.a:0 "Who are they?"
 nf_gim_april.111.b:0 "Where are we?"
