  gim_silverforge_arrival:0 "A People Out of Time"
  gim_silverforge_arrival_desc:0 "The dwarves of Silverforge have been transported to another world and another time. As they prepare to meet the local populace, something strange happens."
  gim_dwarf_knowledge:0 "Dwarven Knowledge"
  gim_dwarf_knowledge_desc:0 "While some of the technology still eludes the dwarves, there is one thing they seem to know much about; Guns. With a fervor the citizens of Gimli have not seen, the dwarves begin to pour over the new age arsenal, giddy with joy."
  gim_begin_again:0 "Time to Begin Again"
  gim_begin_again_desc:0 "The gravest of all travesties this world has to offer is the fact that no one seems to know where the dwarves can find a hold. Apparently, there are no holds, though some have mentioned things called 'Vaults' that act in a similar fashion."
  gim_castanath:0 "A New Castonath?"
  gim_castanath_desc:0 "The city the humans call 'Winnipeg' bears a striking similarity to the ancient city of Castonath. As dwarves, it is our duty to uphold Balgar's legacy and use Winnipeg to rebuild a new Castonath. It is already divided into three distinct quarters, so half of the job is already done. Now, where did that pesky map go..."
  gim_white_walls:0 "White Walls of Winnipeg"
  gim_white_walls_desc:0 "Back home, our Castonath was protected by the great White Walls of Castanor, constructed by Balgar himself. Our new city needs a similar form of protection, though finding that much stone is going to be a problem. Perhaps some Outposts and Bunkers will do the trick."
  gim_siege_corp:0 "Silverforge Siege Corps"
  gim_siege_corp_desc:0 "Back home in Cannor, Silverforge was known for its Siege Corps, who were able to topple even the mightiest of walls. Perhaps a similar unit can be organized here, though the lack of cannons means they will need to use other means."
  gim_surface_mines:0 "Surface Mining"
  gim_surface_mines_desc:0 "If the dwarves know how to do one thing, it's mining. By prioritizing a surface mine system similar to what they used before, Gimli could make a tiny profit and put more dwarves to work in these trying times."
  gim_allocate_resources:0 "Allocation of Resources"
  gim_allocate_resources_desc:0 "While Gimli already has the basic industry needed to undertake the task of building the hold, resources are needed to actually make it. The first step will be to make sure all the materials are accounted for and allocated as they are needed."
  gim_prepare_plans:0 "Preparing the Blueprints"
  gim_prepare_plans_desc:0 "A draft of plans for the hold has already been made, but all the engineers Gimli has are going to be needed for the construction effort. It will take time, but they have assured Erikson a blueprint will be ready soon."
  gim_clear_area:0 "Clearing the Area"
  gim_clear_area_desc:0 "A hold is a rather large project needing a rather large area to work with. Unfortunately, since there are no mountains nearby, it will have to be a surface level hold. THe good news is that the dwarves are already used to this, though they have been debating where the site should go."
  gim_start_construction:0 "Start Hold Construction"
  gim_start_construction_desc:0 "Finally, with all the preparations complete, it is time to begin construction. The only thing left to do now is wait for the foundation to be finished."
  gim_hold_level_one:0 "Dig Level 1:\n§GSurface Hold§!"
  gim_hold_level_one_desc:0 "With the foundation complete, it is time to dig deeper!"
  gim_hold_level_two:0 "Dig Level 2:\n§YUnderground Hold§!"
  gim_hold_level_two_desc:0 "Good progress has been made, but as more dwarves move in to the hold, the space has begun to get cramped. Dig deeper!"
  gim_hold_level_three:0 "Dig Level 3:\n§OCavernous Hold§!"
  gim_hold_level_three_desc:0 "The halls of the hold are starting to take shape and feel like a proper home for the dwarves. However, it seems their thirst for digging remains unsatiated. Commence the dig!"
  gim_hold_level_four:0 "Dig Level 4:\n§MOuter Hold§!"
  gim_hold_level_four_desc:0 "It appears a bit of a roadblock has occurred. The current tools Gimli has is insufficient for the next level of digging. The only way to continue is if more materials and equipment are brought in from the outside."
  gim_hold_level_five:0 "Dig Level 5:\n§oInner Hold§!"
  gim_hold_level_five_desc:0 "The hold now spans over a hundred feet underground. The plans call for a large chamber in the next level, so work must begin as soon as possible."
  gim_hold_level_six:0 "Dig Level 6:\n§PCentral Hold§!"
  gim_hold_level_six_desc:0 "With this next level, the hold will complete its infrastructure and have a central chamber for which the dwarves may coordinate themselves."
  gim_hold_level_seven:0 "Dig Level 7:\n§cLabyrinthine Hold§!"
  gim_hold_level_seven_desc:0 "The corridors of the hold are seemingly endless, a vast labyrinth of a maze to men, but not to the ones who call it home. It seems that the hold is nearing its final stages."
  gim_hold_level_eight:0 "Dig Level 8:\n§RDeep Hold§!"
  gim_hold_level_eight_desc:0 "The hold has now reached depths even the dwarves rarely heard of. It has been a great boon for them, and many now feel like they have found their place in this new world. The blueprints call for one last level, the deepest they can go. It will take more time, but in the end, it must be worth it."
  gim_dig_deeper_question:0 "Digging Deeper?"
  gim_dig_deeper_question_desc:0 "The hold is now complete. However, at the very bottom of its vast tunnels, there lies a strange anomaly. It seems that a layer of rock has been found with an unusual sheen to it. It has attracted the attention of most of the dwarves, with some saying that it should be mined out, and other saying they should not tempt fate. Nothing could possibly go wrong with digging just a little deeper, could it?"
  gim_prepare_for_war:0 "Prepare for War"
  gim_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "It is clear that in order to procure the resources we need for the Hold, we must look outwards. It is inevitable we find ourselves in conflict with the neighboring powers, so we must prepare accordingly. The good news is that some of the Silverforge dwarves have already voiced their commitment to joining the fight, we just need to organize them."
  gim_arborg_problem:0 "The Arborg Problem"
  gim_arborg_problem_desc:0 "Our scouts have reported that to the south lies a vast treasure trove of materials in what was formerly Winnipeg. Unfortunately for us, it is controlled by the Republic of the Three Rivers and heavily guarded. If we are to strike, it must be to the Arborg Junta, a somewhat weaker entity to the north. By securing Arborg, we may stand a chance in the upcoming war with the Republic."
  gim_mercenary_stockpile:0 "The Mercenary Stockpile"
  gim_mercenary_stockpile_desc:0 "Many mercenary outfits operated out of Arborg, and with them comes their guns. A very handsome stockpile of modern firearms is ripe for the taking, but the mercenaries will not be too fond of us if we confiscate them."
  gim_arborg_pacification:0 "Arborg Pacification"
  gim_arborg_pacification_desc:0 "In order to prevent further rebellion, we must act swiftly and pacify the remaining Arborg population. It will be a costly effort, but could be very beneficial so we are not fighting both the Republic and our own rebels."
  gim_bigger_threat:0 "A Bigger Threat"
  gim_bigger_threat_desc:0 "Taking Winnipeg will be a much bigger task than taking Arborg. They are not only better equipped, but also pose a serious military threat to us. To help solve this problem, a veteran dwarf has agreed to come out of retirement, one Dagrin the Destroyer. He seems perfect for the job, a wrecking ball that will help overcome whatever obstacles stand in our way."
  gim_secure_winnipeg:0 "Securing Winnipeg"
  gim_secure_winnipeg_desc:0 "The time has come, we must take the fight to the Republic. Construction of the Hold has slowed, and it is vital we take the riches of the south for ourselves. Despite the danger, the dwarves are ready to fight, it is in their blood afterall."
  gim_take_boats:0 "Tame the Rivers"
  gim_take_boats_desc:0 "The namesake rivers of the Republic offer us a new route to taming the waters. If we were to focus our efforts into the partially rebuilt naval industries, we could become a dominant power and reach far beyond our borders. We can even launch our flagship, the Dameshead, named after our Cannorian homeland."
  gim_take_planes:0 "Take to the Skies"
  gim_take_planes_desc:0 "The dwarves are amazed at hearing of the aviation innovations in the Wasteland. While many express their fears of flying into the sky, just as many are eager to see the world from above. The Republic has some leftover research we could use to kickstart our first steps into controlling the skies."
  gim_take_guns:0 "Nothing Wrong with Guns"
  gim_take_guns_desc:0 "While not as unorthodox as crafting a new boat or flying in the sky, having more guns is never a problem. In fact, looting the Republic's stockpile could have its own benefits, as the dwarves are eager to get their hands on new and better armaments."
  gim_splendid_court:0 "The Splendid Court"
  gim_splendid_court_desc:0 "One of the wonders of Castonath, the Splendid Court has historically been the seat of power in Castanor. We shall have our own Court, though perhaps not as splendid, and will use it as an administrative center. It never hurts to have a throne room."
  gim_dragon_forge:0 "The Dragonforge"
  gim_dragon_forge_desc:0 "One of the wonders of Castonath, the Dragonforge will be the pinnacle of weapon manufacturing in the Wasteland. With the help of the dwarves, it will help forge weapons of unparalleled quality. Not only will we be able to make more weapons, but better ones at that. The hardest part is having to explain what a Dragon is to some of these people."
  gim_grand_bazaar:0 "The Grand Bazaar"
  gim_grand_bazaar_desc:0 "One of the wonders of Castonath, the Grand Bazaar is the central marketplace for our nation. With the help of some caravans and town criers, word of the exotic goods and high quality material will be spread far and wide. Customers from all over the Wasteland will travel to the Bazaar to see what deals they can strike and how many caps they can make."
  gim_bazaar_caps:0 "Rake in the Caps"
  gim_bazaar_caps_desc:0 "Already, the Grand Bazaar has make us a hefty sum of caps just from our trade alone. With the market bustling, we have come up with a great new way to make even more. Taxes!"
  gim_forge_guns:0 "Dragonforge Weapons"
  gim_forge_guns_desc:0 "The first batch of Dragonforge-smithed weapons has come and they do not disappoint. With these instruments of war, we are surely in a position to expand our influence even further than before."
  gim_pesky_neighbors:0 "Pesky Neighbors"
  gim_pesky_neighbors_desc:0 "Our surroundings have been largely consolidated, but a few outliers remain. We must quickly annex them before the upstarts become a threat to what we have created!"
  gim_old_beliefs:0 "Rejecting Old Beliefs"
  gim_old_beliefs_desc:0 "The Old Believers control a rather large piece of territory that we could use to help further expand. It is time we bring the fight to them and usher in our new era."
  gim_final_push:0 "The Final Push"
  gim_final_push_desc:0 "Challenge after challenge, Silverforge has proved its worth. We have created a nation of cooperation. We have done what no one thought possible. We are the solution, but there yet lies one big problem. The so called 'Kingdom' of Manitoba will prove to be our greatest foe yet. With the lands of the former Republic and its territories within our grasp, we now shall become something greater by ending this false Kingdom."
  gim_riding_no_more:0 "Squashing Bugs"
  gim_riding_no_more_desc:0 "A very peculiar nation, if you can call it that. A madman claims to speak to the giant roaches of this place and commands them against his enemies. They may be too big to stomp now, but not big enough gunpowder can't deal with them."
  gim_old_habits:0 "Old Habits"
  gim_old_habits_desc:0 "Despite their lack of modern knowledge, the dwarves are extremely hard workers. Since they cannot yet work in our factories, they have decided to help construct new ones instead. There is still a ways to go, but this is the first step in building trust between men and dwarves."
  gim_collaborate_with_gimli:0 "Collaborate With Gimli"
  gim_collaborate_with_gimli_desc:0 "The dwarves are still rather inexperienced in operating our machinery, but have begun seeking help from the residents of Gimli. If we were to encourage a widespread campaign to get the dwarves knowledgeable on modern equipment, in time they will become masters in their own right. For now, however, we begin with small steps."
  gim_new_techniques:0 "New Techniques"
  gim_new_techniques_desc:0 "Our tools were made to be operated by humans. Thankfully, dwarven anatomy is not too different and with some minor adjustments, the dwarves will be able to fully utilize the larger equipment. It also gives a good oppurtunity for them to familiarize themselves with modern techniques."
  gim_more_experience:0 "Gaining Experience"
  gim_more_experience_desc:0 "Thanks to our efforts to help bring the dwarves up to speed, they are now fully capable of using modern machinery and tools. This will greatly help to incorporate them within our industry and will let us begin the next steps of creating a forge worthy of Balgar."
  gim_renovate_forge:0 "Renovate the Forgehold"
  gim_renovate_forge_desc:0 "While Gimli used to be called a forgehold, they were not quite on the level of the dwarves. Now, with the first stages of the hold complete, we can begin building it into a true forgehold. The first step is to begin building up the factory floor where we may begin tooling of new weapons and equipment."
  gim_expand_forge:0 "Expanding the Forges"
  gim_expand_forge_desc:0 "Now that the forges have been properly set up, work on expanding our facilities may commence."
  gim_new_forges:0 "More Fuel for the Fire"
  gim_new_forges_desc:0 "The fire of our war machine never stops, and with an increasing demand for equipping our soldiers, our ability to make their gear must also increase. We must ramp up production significantly if we are to meet expectations."
  gim_stoke_forges:0 "Stoking the Forge"
  gim_stoke_forges_desc:0 "Already, there has been great progess on our war forges, but another problem has arisen. There seems to be a lack of resources available to properly build new additions. To combat this, a team must be dispatched to gather more supplies and create a new stockpile so we may never run out again."
  gim_dwarf_labor:0 "Dwarven Labor"
  gim_dwarf_labor_desc:0 "As has already become apparent, dwarves just do it better. Their work ethic is impeccable and they seem to have a fire in their hearts that cannot be extinguished. While many wish to focus on our war forges, we must also ensure our industrial capabilities do not fall far behind."
  gim_man_and_dwarf:0 "Pact Between Man and Dwarf"
  gim_man_and_dwarf_desc:0 "Many of the humans from Gimli revere the dwarves as gods amongst men, but this has also caused some tension between the two groups. The humans seem to wish for the dwarves to do much of the labor, as they fear they cannot match their quality. One of the dwarven elders has sought to fix this by drawing up a formal pact of friendship between the groups. No longer will one do all the work, but they shall work together in unison to make a better tomorrow!"
  gim_modern_tools:0 "Modern Tools Require Modern Solutions"
  gim_modern_tools_desc:0 "The dwarves have become quite familiar with the modern tools of men, but the specialized equipment is harder to master. If Silverforge is to continue its industrial boom, it is important to make sure everyone knows how to use everything. After all, modern tools require modern solutions."
  gim_dwarven_crafts:0 "Dwarven Craftsmanship"
  gim_dwarven_crafts_desc:0 "The craftsmanship of the dwarves is incomparable. Their work has started to become the envy of everyone, even outside of Silverforge. They simply make everything better and faster than anyone else can."
  gim_war_forge:0 "The New Warforge"
  gim_war_forge_desc:0 "It is time to officially christen the forgehold as the "Warforge", a fitting name for a facility that will bring the Wasteland to its knees. With its completion, we will be able to finally begin our crusade."
  gim_equip_men:0 "Equipping the Army"
  gim_equip_men_desc:0 "Our army consists of both man and dwarf, but there are somethings the humans can do better. Specifically, they serve as much better special units due to their knowledge of the Wasteland. While the dwarves are nice paddings to our army, let us focus the attention to making our special forces even better."
  gim_dwarf_legions:0 "Dwarven Legions"
  gim_dwarf_legions_desc:0 "Our guns may be more advanced than what the dwarves are accustomed to, but they also have room to improve. In order to make our dwarven legions more formidable, some research must be done."
  gim_dwarf_research:0 "Some Much Needed Studying"
  gim_dwarf_research_desc:0 "With the Warforge complete and our army building, it is time to shift our attention to other matters. One of the ways we can do this is by taking the time to establish more scientific pursuits. There are severla dwarven scholars that have shown interest in studying manuscripts and technological artifacts. Let's give them a place to do just that."
  gim_industry_planning:0 "Industry Planning"
  gim_industry_planning_desc:0 "We have stuffed as much as we can into the Warforge, so it is time to look outward. As our territory grows, we must be able to fill it with new buildings and factories so progress may continue. Some planning on how we will do so is vital."
  gim_equipment_research:0 "Equipment Research"
  gim_equipment_research_desc:0 "Our frontlines are filling out nicely, but our support equipment is lacking to say the least. In order to make the most use out of our troops, some work must be done in that regard."
  gim_dwarf_power_armor:0 "Dwarven Power Armor"
  gim_dwarf_power_armor_desc:0 "When one of the dwarves first saw a suit of power armor, they almost fainted with excitement. They say the power armor is similar to exosuits they had envisioned but never got the chance to create. Unfortunately, none of the suits actually fit the dwarves, but with a little tinkering and some stilts, it could be made compatible."
  gim_forge_industry:0 "Forge-Driven Industry"
  gim_forge_industry_desc:0 "The backbone of our industry is the Warforge, and with it, we have been able to improve so much already. However, if we are to continue expanding to the final level of our hold, we should dedicate some of the resources from the Warforge to the project."
  gim_more_guns:0 "Never Enough Guns"
  gim_more_guns_desc:0 "REPLACE_ME"
  gim_steel_suits:0 "Specially Fitted Suits"
  gim_steel_suits_desc:0 "Some dwarven engineers have come to Erikson with a plan on how to create a special suit of power armor made specifically for the dwarves. While they have warned it is a bit unsafe, the benefits far outweigh the costs. Let production begin!"
