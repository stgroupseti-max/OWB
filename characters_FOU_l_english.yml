    FOU_BLITZ_NAME:0 "Ed Blitz"
    FOU_BLITZ_DESC:0 "The leader of Fourways has born in the same place as its community - in Shasta Pond, a little temporary settlement for traders who travel between the Oregon Trail and Big Circle. Ed's father was a silver-tongued caravaneer, and his mother a rugged caravan guard - and after what he became, one can say he inherited the best traits from both worlds.\n\nAfter his "da" passed away and took over the business, the Blitz boy rapidly grew as a merchant and a local leader, making everybody's favourite rest stop into a proper town. As Shasta Pond quickly got grown out, they had to move to a new place, to the ruins of O'Brien, which they started to rebuild. The man of charisma and strength had to learn new lessons, as leading people a little more than giving great speeches and cracking some skulls - comes with logistical problems, like functioning plumbing and collecting taxes.\n\nFourways, under the leadership of Ed, flourishes, as standing in the shadow of the Bear has its benefits. They would have all the chance to be the new local trading power, but when someone has to compete with both New Reno and Redding and potentially stand on the toes of the Bear, one has to navigate painfully precisely between a Rock and a Hard Place."
