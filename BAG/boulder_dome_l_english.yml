   #First Level
   DOME_elevator_desc:0 "§YElevator§!\n\nThis is one of the elevators we use for travelling between the facility's levels. If we want to go higher or lower a level, all we have to do is use these elevator panels and buttons!\n\n(§yHint:§! Unlocking the levels is tied to your national focuses!)"
   DOME_first_level_east_garage_desc:0 "§YEast Truck Garage Entrance§!\n\nOne of the garages of the Dome. Eddie Galenski and his family use it for parking their trucks, while our military uses the other. If someone steps in, at first glance it's hard to determine if it's a car shop or nursery for little kids, as pre-war toys and vehicle parts litter the place in equal measure."
   DOME_first_level_galenski_quarters_desc:0 "§YGalenski Family Quarters§!\n\nHome of the Galenski's. Multiple little beds, toys strewn around, but it's still kept quite clean. This is where one can usually find the matriarch, Helen, trying to herd the kids and cook for them. Numerous weapons are racked on the walls, safely locked away from the toddlers, but still giving the room a mildly threatening aura."
   DOME_first_level_lobby_entrance_desc:0 "§YLobby Entrance§!\n\nThe main entrance to the whole complex. It was shut down after the incident years ago, locking with pneumatic locks after someone smashed the control panel. It couldn't be opened from outside without explosives, but now that we're inside we can open it, making our move-in smoother."
   DOME_first_level_baggers_quarters_desc:0 "§Y"Baggers" Quarters§!\n\nOne of the larger shared living quarters on the level, where originally [BAG.BAG_LARSEN.GetName] and his troops were accommodated. While Larsen showed signs of unpredictability in the past, without the Baggers Force, we would be done for. They will act as bodyguards for the Dome again - we only have to clean this place up first. Bullet holes and damaged furniture remain, alongside ash piles of friends and foes alike."
   DOME_first_level_storage_desc:0 "§YStorage§!\n\nThe storage room for the first level. It mainly holds food products and equipment for everyday life - spare parts for the coffee machine and extra beds."
   DOME_first_level_toilet_desc:0 "§YMain Bathroom§!\n\nThat's... that's a toilet. What kind of description did you expect? Even soldiers and scientists have to answer the call of nature, you know. ... Are you still here, kiddo? Uh, do you want a fetch quest for spare parts to fix the clogged toilet, for like... twenty NCR dollars and two pre-war food packs?"
   DOME_first_level_west_garage_desc:0 "§YWest Truck Garage Entrance§!\n\nWhile the Galenskis use the other garage, this one is reserved for general military use. Transport trucks and brahmin caravans reside here, bringing supplies to the facility and allowing local merchants to interact with the NCRA. The entrance is decorated with different raider armours and weapons, showing what happens to bandits who think about attacking us."
   DOME_first_level_kitchen_desc:0 "§YCafeteria§!\n\nThe cafeteria on the first level is quite a sad sight. Twenty years ago, we didn't have this level of preparation, and as such we couldn't provide sustaining nourishment for ourselves. All we had was different colours of nutrition paste, all tasteless and unfilling. And now, twenty years later, they're still edible and have the same texture. America didn't survive the nuclear catastrophe, but the nutrition paste did."
   DOME_first_level_quarantine_entrance_desc:0 "§YQuarantine Center Entrance§!\n\nThe entrance was designed to take supplies in the case Quarantine Protocol is activated. It has multiple airlock doors to separate different parties and multiple door codes to maintain security in trying times. Neither Radiation or Limit-115 is present here, so right now it's unused. Of course, we used it recently to get back inside."
   DOME_first_level_officer_quarters_desc:0 "§YMillitary High Corps Quarters§!\n\nThis is where the General and the rest of the high command reside. Same as any other living room, just more spacious and has an extra table in the middle where they play poker and collectable card games from the pre-War area. Their expertise in different fields of warfare makes them useful when investigating the Dome's weapons programs."
   DOME_first_level_hydroponics_garden_desc:0 "§YHydroponics Garden§!\n\nThe hydroponics garden on the first level is a fossil from the old world. A system where we can grow crops without soil seems like a utopic dream, but it actually exists. The garden is shockingly undersized and could only provide fresh food for the scientists within the Dome, but re-learning its technique could bolster our agricultural output tremendously."
   DOME_first_level_water_pump_shack_desc:0 "§YWater Pump Shack§!\n\nA somewhat rusty water pump shack. While the control interface is intact, the gauges are broken but seem easily repairable. As soon as we find somebody with at 25+ Repair Skill to fix it, we'll have access to some clean and filtered water."
   #Second Level
   DOME_second_level_goddard_office_desc:0 "§YDr. Goddard's Office§!\n\nThis is the office of the head of the facility and the principal researcher in one. This post was naturally taken by Dr. Goddard. From here he checks and organizes all incoming research reports. Next to the numerous file cabinets and his personal terminal is a pre-war coffee machine. This presidential extra is why Goddard set up his place here - the equipment is unmovable, as it is built into the wall."
   DOME_second_level_agnes_office_desc:0 "§YDr. Agnes's Office§!\n\nThis is the office of the vice-principal researcher. As someone trustworthy and experienced, Dr. Agnes was assinged this role. This room is nothing extraordinary, it is half the size of its neighbor but has double the amount of paperwork that needs processing. There's a paper note under the desk with the word §t"SISYPHUS"§! written over it."
   DOME_second_level_common_residence_1_desc:0 "§YDonald's Room§!\n\nThis room is minimalistic, simple, and without many decorations. While they're predominantly pre-war posters about scientific equations, there are some handmade drawings of simple geometrical shapes - Donald says making them and watching them helps him unwind and focus on his theorems."
   DOME_second_level_common_residence_2_desc:0 "§YJames' Room§!\n\nOne of the fanciest rooms, it makes an interesting contrast with its neighbor. Gold is often used as a decorating color. James' rebelling nature may require a thorough room search... who knows what we could find under his bed or in his nightstand?"
   DOME_second_level_common_residence_3_desc:0 "§YPaul's Room§!\n\nA chaotic mess of a room, worse than most teenagers are. Like a hurricane swept through, everything is either on his bed or simply lying on the floor. While Paul's drug problems aren't a secret, it is surprising that his Mentats are just tossed on the bed sheets."
   DOME_second_level_common_residence_4_desc:0 "§YNina's Room§!\n\nThis room is ever closed on multiple locks, so we have no idea what it looks like. But if we can believe the people who passed in front when Nina either entered or left the room, there is a makeshift statue of Goddard on a platform. Its head shines blindingly bright, or so they say."
   DOME_second_level_common_residence_5_desc:0 "§YXian's Room§!\n\nXian's old room. Her treachery hurt everyone in the Expedition, but Paul suffers most without her. While everybody is angry at her and nobody expects her to come back, they keep her room as unoccupied and tidy as ever."
   DOME_second_level_common_residence_6_desc:0 "§YCandice's Room§!\n\nCandice stuck close to her students even after they moved into the Dome. She acts as a mother to them and assists with their scientific experiments. She has a personal terminal in her room, making numerous reports logs to someone. We don't know who."
   DOME_second_level_common_residence_7_desc:0 "§YDianne's Room§!\n\nDianne, being a lower-ranking officer of the NCRA should neither have her own room nor a place in the NCR quarters, but one was arranged for her. She was never fond of her fellow soldiers and feels safer away from the male dominated barracks. Her talents in hydromechanics make her irreplaceable, so she stays here, whether the Major likes it or not."
   DOME_second_level_common_residence_8_desc:0 "§YWahl's Room§!\n\nTypically we wouldn't let civilians take refuge in the Dome, Wahl's work makes him all too useful a person to have on hand. The dome lays in ruins, and the Welder's talents are all but necessary."
   DOME_second_level_common_residence_9_desc:0 "§YUncle Jim's Room§!\n\nUncle Jim's presence is just as justified as Wahl's. While the younger one excels at building or repairing things, he doesn't have the patience for maintenance work. That's where Jim comes in."
   DOME_second_level_common_residence_10_desc:0 "§YRoche's Room§!\n\nMost people watched with suspicious eyes when we let our supermutant into the Dome and gave him a room to reside. While he is fiercely loyal to us, his supermutant nature is the greatest benefit he provides. Being entirely resistant to radiation and even most diseases, such as the Blu Flu, makes him the best scout we could ask for here. Sacrificing one of the largest rooms for his services is the least we could do."
   DOME_second_level_common_residence_11_desc:0 "§YAgnes' Old Room§!\n\nWhen Presper was the principal scientist and Goddard the vice-principal, Agnes took this room as her own. Since she moved over to the vice-principals office, it has stayed empty. Only Agnes's little garden remained there, used by others on the level."
   DOME_second_level_toilet_desc:0 "§YBathroom§!\n\nOh, my, we're here again... This is a restroom where people do their business. I don't know what else I could put here for you to read about. What about checking one of the stalls for a skeleton? Maybe it has some nice loot or even a cool hat! Who knows! Not me, that's for sure."
   DOME_second_level_gym_desc:0 "§YPhysical Fitness Facility§!\n\nMaybe some find it strange to have a well-equipped gym in a research facility, but a prolonged scientific study is not only stressful for the mind but for the body as well. Even if we dismiss chronic problems as backpains caused by too much sitting, it's simply not healthy for the research quality if someone neglects their body. It is used more by the officers than the researchers, but it's still a frequently used part of the Dome."
   DOME_second_level_weapons_lab_desc:0 "§YFirearm and Auxiliary Equipment Development Laboratory§!\n\nAlso known simply as the Weapon Research Lab, this place was just a secondary research gig. Just as the other less significant studies they conducted here, it holds minimal clues to help us finish what they started. But who knows, maybe it still hides some secrets..."
   DOME_second_level_weapons_lab_testing_chamber_desc:0 "§YParticle Beam Research§!\n\nThe prototype is linked to the main reactor of the Dome, as it requires so high an energy supply that nothing else could sustain it. It was never testfired, as the reactor couldn't simultaneously supply the ZAX unit and the weapon. Nothing that our resident Chief Electromechanic Engineer can't balance out, but we still need our reactor to make it so."
   DOME_second_level_armour_lab_desc:0 "§YPersonal Armour Development Laboratory§!\n\nThe Armour Research Lab, just like its sister room, is highly underappreciated. Due to the limited funding, they could only perform minimal testing and research. But there still may be something useful inside..."
   DOME_second_level_armour_lab_testing_chamber_desc:0 "§YPower-Armour Prototype§!\n\nChief Engineer Armstrong's little project. Never saw any action or even a test unit manufactured. It seems excessive, unnecessary complicated in implementation and relatively expensive to produce - but feasible."
   DOME_second_level_plague_lab_desc:0 "§YPlague and Biohazard Research Laboratory§!\n\nThe Dome was created for plague prevention. The Rocky Mountain Arsenal leak made its existence necessary. There was an attempt to make a cure for the Blu Flu here as well, and while they didn't succeed, they developed medicine to slow down the process somewhat."
   DOME_second_level_plague_lab_terminal_1_desc:0 "§YResearch Log L1M1T-115-2053-55§!\n§YName:§! Dr. William Farr II\n§YDate:§! 2055, IT (ignoblia tempus)\n\nIn conjunction with the West-Tek Research Facility, the Coloradan United Research Electorate (from here, CURE), which the Boulder Dome Research Facility is part of,  has started to work on a cure for the recently diagnosed "New Plague".\nWhile the name is already unnecessarily negative due to the tabloid press, we can only blame prior inaction for this situation. The epidemic started more than two years ago, and until this point, they expected that the quarantine in itself would be enough to combat it. Better later than never. The first cures already seem promising, but we'll have to wait for the test results to arrive to be sure.\n"

Dr. William Farr II\n§YDate:§! 2063, IT\n\nHere we are again, reopening a case we believed closed for good. More than a decade passed, and another outbreak of this not-so-New Plague emerged. We firmly believed we found the cure, but our vaccines are ineffective against the new strain. We'll have to study its mutagenic properties, so we can stop it from overcoming our solutions. As Project Safehouse finally gets wind, our funding dwindles quickly, so we'll have to stop all other research in the facility if we want to successfully overcome this. Luckily, nobody from the research team has caught the virus yet, which is a miracle, as we all sustain ourselves with that terrible nutrition paste. Our immune systems must be shot to hell. But I'm hopeful - we already stopped this virus once, and we can stop it again.\n"
   DOME_second_level_plague_lab_terminal_3_desc:0 "§YResearch Log L1M1T-115-2073§!\n§YName:§! Dr. William Farr II\n§YDate:§! 2077, Oct, 22\n\nMaybe for the first time in my career, I feel inadequate to fulfil the task I have been entrusted with. Not necessarily because the qualities of this "Blue Flu" has shown yet, but because I have to analyze twenty-year-old reports of the infection. I'm an epidemiologist, not an archivist. Still, I'll have to find something that could help us finally get a breakthrough. Maybe we missed a crucial detail, or maybe one of the older cures would work again...\nIt would benefit us greatly if the West-Tek folks would share their research with us, but the government is as secretive as ever. Due to the virus' rapid mutation, all functional cures became obsolete quickly. Maybe the rest of the team has already gave up, but I will not. I'll work and catalogue all this nonsense until I find my answers. Or maybe the world will end first!\n"
   DOME_second_level_plague_lab_terminal_4_desc:0 "§YResearch Log L1M1T-115-BL0-FL03§!\n§YName:§! Dr. Victor Mathias Presper\n§YDate:§! 2253, IT\n\nRereading these old reports filled me with both disappointment and awe. First disappointed, seeing how my old colleagues failed to realize the Plague's main attributes in time and how ineffectively they tried to overcome them. Many serums and antibiotics were developed, but they only granted a temporary reprieve. The virus apparently can go dormant in the cells, only to break out later, making seemingly "cured" people into carriers again. Truly fascinating. The last strains allegedly even cause sterility in the survivors. While old Farr lacked the brilliance to see it, it is painfully obvious where the virus came from and how it operated. This, however, means while this "Limit 115" is an awe-inducing tool in my hands, the virus' close resemblance to the FEV will spare most of the supermutants its effects. Luckily, I've found another solution. All I'll need is some help achieving it...\n"
   DOME_second_level_robobrain_lab_desc:0 "§YBrain- Extraction and Surgery Facility§!\n\nThe first step in creating a robobrain unit is simple - obtaining a functional brain to control it. This process starts by taking one from a skull, as gruesome as it sounds. We'll have to find some...'volunteers' to try it for ourselves."
   DOME_second_level_code_lab_desc:0 "§YCODE Protocol Research Facility§!\n\nThe CODE (Challange, Opportunity, Discipline and Ethics) program was initially developed for coma and seizure patients, adapted to "aligning" robobrains-to-be and programming them afterwards. It was also used to treat PTSD, Chinese brainwashing, and instill new skills. When used on regular (non-robobrained) subjects, it can cause problems with long-term use (hallucinations, seizures, memory lapses)."
   DOME_second_level_sleepers_lab_desc:0 "§YLong-term Cryonisis Research Facility§!\n\nBoulder Dome was a primary developer of cryogenic-sleep technology, initially developed for space travelling. While the technology was never properly finished, some units had been relocated elsewhere in the USA to further test thems. The storage log mentions the Sierra Army Depot as receiving some. Next to generators and operating machines, there are also two sleeper tanks, one holding a patient, which the scientists nicknamed "Bedhead"."

   DOME_third_level_water_pipe_maintenance_desc:0 "§YWater Pipe Acces & Maintenance§!\n\nThis place is a plumber's nightmare. All of the pipes in the facility lead here in a labyrinthine snarl of copper and steel. The access to repair the pipes is tight and cramped, and the only failsafe for if water gets contaminated is in this room-- a singular water chip. If that water chip fails, the water from Boulder Creek flowing in would no longer be purified and would be contaminated by rads and who knows what else. Who would design a plumbing system with such an obvious failure point?"
   DOME_third_level_energy_research_desc:0 "§YGeothermical Energy Research Laboratory§!\n\nThis is all theoretical, but if we were to harness the power of the heat beneath the earth's crust, it would be a far safer alternative to nuclear energy. This is a fantastic idea with plenty of amazing applications for giving us an actual safe source of renewable energy. It's such a shame that the NCR government will not give us funding for this because it would detract from existing jobs at Hoover Dam or something. Quite unfortunate indeed."
   DOME_third_level_steam_research_desc:0 "§YSteam Energy Research Laboratory§!\n\nAt its base, all industrialization is steam-powered. The difference is how you boil the water. In this facility, they were researching new ways to boil water. New ways of generating heat."
   DOME_third_level_bathroom_desc:0 "§YBathroom§!\n\nWhat do you know? Inside the bathroom, there is a toilet. In other news, Goddard can be found in his office, and you can find a tree inside a forest. Perhaps if you went on a quest for a water chip or your missing relatives you would be doing something actually useful instead of reading this pointless piece of flavor text."
   DOME_third_level_lounge_desc:0 "§YLounge§!\n\nThe first thing that was on leadership's priority list was to modify these machines so that they would take NCR dollars. That done, they walked away satisfied that they had accomplished something in this facility. Unfortunately for them, they did not make it so that the vending machines ever worked. So as it stands, we are putting money into the machines and nothing is coming out of them. That does not stop leadership from taking the money anyway."

I know that there is a lot of stress to keep going and going like a deranged rabbit banging on a drum, but that doesn't mean you should leave your used psycho needles out on the mattress in the open where anyone can flop onto them. Someone should clean that up. Not me, just someone else."
   DOME_third_level_office_one_desc:0 "§YOffice of Dr. Eavor§!\n\nThis office is controlled chaos. Neat stacks of paper stand like rows of soldiers on a few desks with books weighing them down and preventing them from scattering. Other books are very intentionally marked with bookmarks and then scattered haphazardly across the room. One of the walls has been turned into a makeshift corkboard, pinning up various geological studies of the Rocky mountains near Boulder. Written on a paper in the center of it all is: “Closed loop system: Reduces fossil fuel emission to near 0.” What does that even mean?"

The drawers once you open them are filled to the brim with files haphazardly tossed inside to rest alongside loose papers books held open to certain pages by having their spines bent and weighed down. On a rolling blackboard on one side there is advanced rocket science calculations, on the other there is a buxom woman drawn carefully in chalk in a suggestive position with something written in polish beneath.

   DOME_fourth_level_brain_bar_desc:0 "§YBrain Bar§!\n\nThe Brain Bar, as the research papers called it, is where the brains with "special treatment" marks are stored. They are political enemies of the old system, military figures with too much power and criminal minds that resisted the CODE program surprisingly well. They swam in their oversized fish tanks for centuries, hooked up with powdered mentats."
   DOME_fourth_level_reactor_access_desc:0 "§YReactor Access§!\n\nThis is the maintenance access to the Dome's main reactor. It's been in a deep sleep for a long time now, and we'll have to restart it. We'll need more electricity to make the attempt, so we'll need to fix the emergency reactor in the basement before we can."
   DOME_fourth_level_purification_center_desc:0 "§YPurification Center§!\n\nThe purification centre keeps the whole facility up to a liveable standard. Handles the water, air and temperature levels alike, but it is in dire disrepair. If we ever want to stroll these halls without a suit, we'll have to fix it."
   DOME_fourth_level_morgue_desc:0 "§YMorgue§!\n\nThis place is filled with dead bodies, brains extracted. Likely victims of the facility from before the Great War."
   DOME_fourth_level_cement_grave_desc:0 "§YCement Cementary§!\n\nWe aren't sure anymore what this room was for in the past, but when we arrived twenty years ago, we had some struggles with glowing ones inside the facility. We buried them with cement. It serves as a memento of our past."
   #Fifth Level
   DOME_fifth_level_zax_ai_desc:0 "§YZAX AI§!\n\nThe treasure of the Dome, the goal of our Expedition, the ZAX autonomous intelligence of Boulder finally lays before us. A supercomputer dating back to the pre-war era, it participated in numerous research programs in the Dome. Saving it before it destroys itself is paramount."
   DOME_fifth_level_emergency_generator_desc:0 "§YEmergency Generator§!\n\nThe emergency generator is a last-ditch effort to keep the facility running if the unthinkable would happen. It happened, but they didn't anticipate two hundred years of function. While it generates just enough electricity to keep the ZAX Mainframe running, we will need to restore it to full power before we can touch the rest of the electrical grid."
   DOME_fifth_level_mainframe_databank_desc:0 "§YMainframe Databank§!\n\n A long block or row of databanks, holding the immense amount of information that the ZAX already generated through doing the "Calculation". We cannot do much with this hardware."
