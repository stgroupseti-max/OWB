    colkeg_desc_desc:0 "The barren land strip between Dog-City and the Platte Tribuary today is almost entirely habited by ghouls. Most of them have been chased out from the aforementioned city, while others migrated here, searching for a safe haven. There was peace between the people. But everything changed when the expedition from the New California Republic arrived.\n\nSoldiers and scientists flooded the place, taking leadership over settlements in the middle region, and while no actual atrocity has happened to date, tension is clearly in the air. Sooner or later, something will happen which will trigger the unavoidable conflict, and the only question is not if but when?"

    coloradan_powderkeg_mission_desc:0 "Soldiers are staring at each other at the border, gripping their weapons nervously, sweating nervously. The ghouls are worried about what the expeditioners are planning, and the Californians dread the "zombies" charging them down at any minute. Somebody will be scared, somebody will misread a situation, and somebody will shoot the first shot. Tragedy is unavoidable."
