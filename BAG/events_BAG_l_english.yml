But just to humour you, I will answer to the best of my knowledge.\n\nYou're standing on the 5th and last level of the facility known as the Boulder Dome, in the city of Boulder, the former state of Colorado and Commonwealth of the Four States. It was built as a structure specifically designed to withstand a direct nuclear attack. Construction of the research dome was not considered until the nearby Rocky Mountain Arsenal had leakage of toxic waste, creating a poisonous cloud that swept through Denver, killing many. In reaction, the military-funded a program to create a self-sustaining research dome, making it resistant to a nuclear attack and having the primary research inside be dedicated to the New Plague. This "city of the future" was to be a prototype for settlements on the moon and other planets."

While it was nice to wear his Power Armor, he couldn't take any risks of stirring up any bad memories on a day of commemoration. Goddard had been vocally opposed to it as, in his words, they were getting participation medals for "walking a short distance". Coleridge made it clear that his men would get whatever rewards he deemed them fit to receive. \n\nStanding at a hastily constructed podium on a more readily constructed stage, he turned to Agnes, who had prepared a number of impromptu badges and medals. She had done her best to keep them consistent, but it was hard to find anything that wasn't the equivalent of adding a pin to a bottlecap and calling it a medal. He rather liked the subtle differences in the designs.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to bestow the Long Trek Medal on each and every one of you. You have all made a tremendous effort coming here. I'm proud of you. Tandi would be proud of you. I'm sure Goddard's heart is swelling as well, even if he can't come out of his lab to show it." A chuckle rippled through the crowd. One by one, Coleridge called the battalions that had made the trek.

Then he snapped his finger towards an ancient blueprint of a large circular facility. "When we reach Colorado, I am going to give you all a very special task.

They set out eastward towards the old state of Colorado.\n\nIt was an arduous journey, sailing upon the Colorado River through numerous old-world states. While we came across many interesting finds, the only one worthy of note would be a crash site in the Grand Canyon. The wreckage of the old BOMB Station 002, while not measurable to the Dome, still held numerous secrets - leaving a small group there with the goal of further investigation as we continued eastward.

The Jackals, long exiled from California, had come out this far.\nThey put up a worthy fight resisting us, but in the end they fled from our forces. Their half-crazed leader, Howlerí, fled only after his body was nearly torn into pieces by bullets, leaving the rest of his group to be put down effortlessly.\n\nWhat we found in the Dome was nothing short of astonishing, not referring to the scientific miracle of the Dome itself; a man from the old world named Presper and his companions, slumbering in cryogenic sleep. After awaking them we attempted to cooperate with them peacefully; our short time spent together was... productive, to say the least.

After a few weeks, he presented his conclusion:\n\nHe wanted to wipe the slate clean. Terminate everyone he deemed unworthy, imbecilic, a 'lower life form' or whatever. A simple genocide. We resisted, supported by a couple of his formerly frozen colleagues. There was some shouting, some begging... and eventually, a firefight between the parties.\n\nWe had to evacuate from the Dome ASAP. In that chaos, we had to decide what to save on the way out: either the technology that nobody in the wasteland could ever replicate in the following millennia or the most precious resource we had... the lives of our people."

Congress had to know about Presper and our Expedition's findings.\n\nSince then, twenty years have passed, the members of the Expedition waiting for the day when they can see the Dome again. Cold wrath, impatience, and an insatiable need for glory and retribution slowly consumed their hearts and minds. After the Republic began its "Pacification of the Mojave" it became painfully evident that Congress would never provide funding for their intellectual crusade. But after some lobbying with a certain baron, private funding was acquired. In 2273 the Second Colorado Expedition was officially ready to go back again.\n\nThe Zombie Battalion encompasses four companies worth of troopers, complemented with the support of the 5th Engineering Company and one of the newly incorporated ranger detachments led by Ranger-Major Vera Prasad. The Academy provided the original scientists from the First Expedition and a handful of students from the Followers of the Apocalypse. Repeating the same arduous journey was more than exhausting for the Expedition's veterans, but they had to come back.\n\nThe roads and waters became ever more dangerous in that time, a minor skirmish happening in the Grand Canyon, where our old backup team fired at us from the old, now fortified station they were once tasked with researching. Deciding to simply move on in fear of potential losses, we'll never forget their betrayal. They were absent from their posts during our retreat, and now they have stabbed us in the back."

Both settlements were too surprised by the NCR's presence to show any resistance. The small number of local ghouls left the area, leaving a local welders' commune and jet junkies under our jurisdiction - what splendid civilians to rule over.\n\nTo the west are religious fanatics that follow a "Great Glowing One" who weaponizes radiation. To the east are the "Withered Dogs"; a rag-tag band of ghouls, both ex-national guard and old Communist invaders.

We have a wall against our back, and in every other direction are potential enemies waiting to strike.\n\nWe're outnumbered, outgunned, and surrounded - and most of our soldiers look at the local ghoul population with distrust.

Coleridge made a vague gesture of assent, so Agnes took her place across from him. "You know you're a soldier, right?" \n\n"Thanks for noticing. Do you think maybe a soldier should handle military affairs?" \n\n"Please let me finish?" Agnes wasn't exactly threatening, yet Coleridge felt compelled enough by her tone. He made an apologetic gesture. "That's alright. Now, as the top CO around here, you see things differently. You are used to battles with many troops and abundant supply. We're cut off out here, General. Your tactics won't work so well. Goddard wants us to cooperate with the locals, and I believe that is the best way forward." \n\n"So I'm good for nothing, am I?" \n\n"I'm not finished!" Agnes raised her hand. "Goddard has good ideas on a macro level, but you are still critical to our military organization. His idea will work in general, but you, General, must still make many important decisions about how we approach our battles. Those decisions are yours to make, but please, trust me and trust Goddard on this." \n\n"...as long as you will still consider my expertise in the future." \n\n"I will. You have my word.""

"Based on historical documents I studied, a war on two fronts is untenable. We should take out the easiest target of the two with an all-out offensive. After that, turn and face the other."\n\n"If we are victorious, of course. We cannot abandon one of the frontlines and hope local resistance and logistical problems slow them down enough until we win. This isn't a war game.

Dr. Goddard and General Coleridge sat there, quietly talking. Despite the cacophony around them, they heard each other perfectly.\n\n"It is finally over, isn't it?" Commented the General, tightly holding his mug of beer. He liked the sour taste and hated shots.\n\n"On the contrary, it has only begun." Answered the doctor with a serious look. \n\n"Oh, come on.

Baross had ordered steak and brandy, supplied by a friend back in the NCR. Bailey had offered cigars, specialty made exclusively for the opulent in society, with nearly 100% tobacco purity.\n\nBailey politely dug into his steak, taking even cuts and equally even bites. "This steak is delicious, Baross. But your prices are much too low for them. 15 caps for a steak! If any old fool can afford it, we'd have more overfed brahmin than workers!" He laughed heartily, taking a drink of his liquor.\n\nBaross took a puff of the Baron's cigar, savoring the rich flavor it offered. "They're not my prices, they're from a friend of mine back in the NCR. The Gundersons, they specialize in ranching Brahmin and Bighorners. They're actually looking for some new land for new herds. Your lands offer quite fertile soil compared to those in the NCR."\n\nBailey raised an eyebrow, dabbing his mouth with a napkin to clean off any remnants of his finished meal. "Yes, and in exchange for those lands, you will provide a mutually beneficial deal?"\n\nBaross nodded. "In my time as Governor, I've come to hear things, Baron. I've heard you're a man of society, class, civilization.

They failed despite everything to convince Victor Presper to stop their madness. They failed to stop the facility from exploding. Perhaps they failed intentionally. They saw their infection with an old world disease as a sign that perhaps this facility was better off dying. And so the Dome, this beacon of old world progress, died.\n\nThe third time is your fault personally. You failed.

I take it you're one of the labcoats Goddard sent to evaluate things?" Agnes wandered behind Nina, answering for her. "Why yes, how did you know that?"\n\n"I have my ways. It is right unfortunate that people still have so much hate in their hearts, but with folks like you and I protecting folks like these ones here, we should make this place into a more caring and compassionate place for all." Reaching a white gloved hand out, Stiller picked up and comforted the ghoul child, walking them back to their mother. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a box of Fancy Lads, giving it to the child. For the mother, he pulled out a small wad of cash.\n\n"Not sure how much the conversion rate is, but if you stop by a police station or Bagger trading post, you should find that to be worth about a thousand caps." The woman looked at him, teary eyed. Before she could speak, Stiller tipped his hat at her, tipped his hat at the child, waved at the scientists, and hopped back in his car, whistling a tune all the way."

He would have loved to put a bullet through that great glowing head ASAP, but he couldn't risk that big garish helmet blocking the shot. He imagined they only took it off him in private, where his scope couldn't see. \n\nFinally, his moment arrived. Due to some completion in their construction, the Glowing One was about to meditate in the open air. Off came the helmet, exposing that hideous green target. Pierce held his breath, squeezed the trigger on his DKS, and the Great Glowing One became a great glowing spray. He snuck away, using a cloak and some bioluminescent paint as a long distance disguise. Pierce imagined what kind of award or title he'd get for bagging this prize.

I was just examining how you were linking that outflow pipe to the drainage shaft. You did consult with Tom and Kat that the inflow valve is capable of sustaining the water pressure, right?

Their loss, Coleridge thought, that they miss out on the keynote of their coming transformation. \n\n"Thank you all for coming today," Coleridge began, "and thank you for putting your faith in me. Colorado has been through many disasters in its time. It has been ravaged by robots. It has been ravaged by savages. It has been ravaged by the Legion, if you'll forgive a tautology." A joke only he and the Californians appreciated. "Colorado cries out for someone to put it back together. Someone to build it into a safe and stable home for honest folks. I...we, will answer that cry. The New California Republic is here to bring peace to the land, as it brought peace to California, and as it brings peace to the Mojave. As your elected leader, I will spearhead these efforts, and prepare Colorado for the day it takes its place as the next state of New California. Do not think of this as a victory for the NCR alone. People of Colorado, a victory for California is a victory for you!" \n\nThe end of his speech ellicited cheers and hollers from the crowd. Again, mainly from loyalists, less so from Coloradans.

He wondered what it would be like to be part of such a thing? To combine minds with other geniuses to create a Super-Calculator? He could only imagine. \n\nUnfortunately The Calculator would have to remain a mere story. It was clearly no longer operating.

By the time they returned, their appreciation of mental health concerns had much improved. A generous donation from certain private groups spurred the inclusion of faith ministers that performed such services.\n\nCecil "Lergeyman" Leander was the soul called upon for such duties, acting as the Brigade Chaplain. Though his nature had earned him a slothful reputation, he was a resolute man of faith that had encouraged many soldiers in his time.

Agnes went on for a while like this, eventually accompanied by the sound of Goddard scrawling down notes."

  nf_baggers_boulder.68.desc:0 "Briggs hugged the suitcase tightly as he made his way to his quarters. He couldn't believe his luck, happening to find that key while checking the other restrooms. Who would have thought someone would stash hard earned pre-war cash in a lavatory of all places? He was even luckier no one questioned his expedition to the lower levels. It wasn't like he had a good reason to be down there. \n\nHe was going to stash it somewhere safe and sneak it out of the facility later. He just had to avoid-\n\n"Major!" Coleridge's call caused Briggs to jump. "What have you got there?" \n\n"Uh...it's just, uh...a little project of mine, I-" Coleridge didn't wait for him to finish, striding up and snatching the suitcase. He peeked inside. \n\n"You know the rules, Major. All cash assets in the Dome are property of the government. Be happy I won't discipline you for this...lapse in judgement." Coleridge walked away with Briggs' prize. The Major deflated, and went inside his quarters to mope."

  nf_baggers_boulder.6.desc:0 ""Are you sure this is necessary?" Coleridge asked, climbing out of his power armour. \n\n"Your armour provides significant protection against gas and radiation, I don't suggest testing it against the Blu Flu. These suits are well tested against it." The two of them donned their biohazard suits as they spoke. They were not unlike Vault suits, but based on an older design. Much bulkier, and of a lighter blue. \n\n"How can we be so certain the plague is still alive down there?" Coleridge was very uncomfortable in his suit. He felt vulnerable in it, and he could see less with this helmet on. \n\n"Scanners still suggest it's there. Nobody's forcing you to join me, you know." \n\n"Like I'd let you go alone," Coleridge stepped into the decontamination chamber to the right, as Goddard went into the lefthand one, "I just...don't feel comfortable going so deep underground." \n\n"Are you claustrophobic? That's curious given you spend your time in a walking box." Goddard's tone indicated genuine surprise. \n\n"You got a problem with that?" Coleridge barked back. \n\n"Oh no, not at all. If you are and are still willing to risk the journey, I respect you more for that.""

  nf_baggers_boulder.7.desc:0 ""How are you holding up?" Goddard asked Coleridge, who trailed behind him. The General stood straight, too proud to display his fear. \n\n"I'm fine." He replied curtly. The tunnels were the barest part of the facility. They were damp and dark, which reminded Goddard that they needed to fix the waterworks and generators. Both of them gripped their flashlights tightly. \n\n"Have you ever visited San Francisco before? The Shi city?" Goddard asked abruptly, breaking Coleridge's train of thought. \n\n"Yes, once. Part of a military delegation. Why?" \n\nGoddard reached up and grasped the cable that connected his suit to the central system. "We're like the trams they have there. Did you see those?" \n\nGoddard let out a nervous laugh. "Yeah, yeah...we are like those." They continued deeper into the tunnels, searching for the means to power the elevator and descend yet again."

  nf_baggers_boulder.8.desc:0 "Goddard couldn't hide his nerves. He felt like the wasteland, the wars, the diplomatic sparring, all that was doable. Having to face his greatest failure, the machine they had to abandon? That was another story. His bald head was coated in sweat. "It's quite hot in here, isn't it?" He spoke to Coleridge. He tried to wipe the sweat from his brow, only to remind himself he was wearing a helmet. \n\n"It really isn't." The General responded. He was relieved to finally be out of those narrow corridors. "We might be going deeper, but my personal circle of hell is behind me." He commented as the elevator took them down. \n\n"I would never have guessed you'd read Dante's Inferno, General." \n\n"I am full of surprises, Goddard. This little adventure won't stop reminding me of it, and now...I'd say your final trial is commencing." The elevator finally settled on the last level. The doors began to crack open. \n\n"What was the engraving on the entrance of hell, again?""
