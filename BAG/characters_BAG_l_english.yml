  BAG_GODDARD_NAME:0 "Dr. Goddard"
  BAG_GODDARD_DESC:0 "An old, stiff, never-smiling scientist who was so bothersome that President Tandi did everything in her power to keep him away from Shady Sands, constantly sending him to the furthest corners of the NCR on various research programs. That is half the reason he volunteered to lead the expedition to the Boulder Dome: at least that way he'd get to stay in one place and do research of his own.\n\nThe struggles and misfortune that the original Expedition suffered through have further jaded him. Goddard's ire is fixed on the late Victor Presper, who wrested the Dome from him all those years ago. The scars of the body have healed, but his pride might never recover."
  BAG_GODDARD_RESEARCH_ADVISOR_desc:0 "Goddard may have been sidelined, but it doesn't mean he will give up his plans for the Dome. Boulder is so close, and learning its secrets is of paramount importance to the Expedition. While he has no control over the overall expedition anymore, this means that he has more time to focus on the projects we need to finish."

He joined the NCR's army young, and rose through the ranks due to his talent in field operations. He repeatedly displayed the virtues of bravery, heroism, loyalty and quick thinking. He's also a capable engineer, constructing and maintaining his own custom power armor in his spare time.\n\nUnfortunately, his political tone-deafness caused senior politicians to see him as unreliable. Unwilling to be sidelined, he was happy to accept a posting halfway across America just to get back into the field. The pencil-pushing jackasses might have meant it as a trap, but in Colorado Coleridge has finally come into his own."
  BAG_COLERIDGE_CHIEF_OF_ARMY_desc:0 "§YName§!: Michael Coleridge\n§YMilitary Rank§!: General\n§YMilitary Moniker§!: "Tincan"\n§YProfile§!: As the General of the Expedition, Coleridge is painfully aware how vulnerable they are.

One of the original veterans of the First Expedition, Larsen suffered from an addiction to RadAway, constant battles with ghouls, and watching his men die to their commanders' hubris and incompetence. His addiction came under control back in the NCR, but his itch for a fix still remains.\n\nGoddard believes that Larsen's addiction is nothing more than a detriment to the whole of the mission, and that he should be treated or face permanent exile.\n\nColeridge, despite his steely personality, believes that Larsen has the experience and ruthlessness to help pacify Colorado. He sees his addiction as a trivial limiting factor.\n\nWhoever turns out to be right in the end, all Larsen knows is that as long as he keeps his eyes open and mouth shut, he won't find himself in the same position he was decades ago. Hopefully."

Her life was relatively uneventful, not to mention the everpresent picture of a brahmins rump in her head and the occasional beatings from the baron's son, James, who presented his affection towards her in a very childish and brute manner. Her only escape from her reality was to sneak out to the local wasteland and hunt geckos and other wildlife - she was good at that. This all changed when she ran into a ranger who was under heavy gunfire from a group of raiders.\n\nShe did her best to produce cover fire for the figure in the black leather armour, even though she never shot at a human being before. Long story short, they won the gunfight, and the ranger, who later introduced herself as Angela Deth, took her under her wings and started little Vera's career as a ranger.\n\nWhen the Colorado Expedition formed, she volunteered to lead the ranger team "November" to accompany the Doctor and the General, as previously, her mentor takes her own campaign to Colorado and she did not return yet.

Well, until he found himself a-falling for some girl and needed a job to secure a future for himself and his future wife.\n\nApplying for the military, where he could be as rowdy as he wanted and still be free to roam between the areas of operations, seemed like a good idea. Surprisingly, he found his calling in police enforcement and taking the freedom of others away. However, he made two fatal mistakes in his life. The first was he fell for a beautiful flower of a girl who was born with a mysterious sickness. Feeling completely powerless, Ralph had to watch her Rosie slowly but surely withering away, petal by petal. Second, he found a great friend in Coleridge and his posse, and when they departed for Colorado, he followed them. He needed to get his mind away from the place he knew as his home, and after all...\n\n§gCause he's a wanderer, who roam around, around, around, around...§!"

The Ma'ii were defeated in battle by Caesar's Legion during their Arizonan campaign and later completely assimilated by them. As he was the leader of the defending force, the Legion planned to parade his head around on a pike, so he and his family had to flee from their homeland of Naschitti. His family settled down next to the Coloradan river, and he started to work at a drydock - maybe as someone poor and looked down on, but as a freeman. This fragile peace couldn't stay for long, however...\n\nThe Frumentarii found them, and while he was at work, they massacred his family and were ready to defile their bodies as punishment. Philip was late, but not too late. His heroic rescue of the bodies is still talked about today. The heavenly wrath he fell with on the "wealth collectors" is still a horror story for the local legio. His daring escape through the water and pirate-like raiding of the shoreline made him a real nuisance. He was known since as "Phlegias" and made him the boogeyman for any riverfarer legionnaire.\n\nBearing the name of the lesser ferrymen of the underworld, his talent with ships come as little surprise. He ran out of supplies while operating in the Grand Canyon, and the Expedition picked him up after that. Coleridge quickly promoted him to Commander of the Expedition.\n\n§RPhlegias will fight as long as he has to, to see the end of the Legion.§!"

After he got old and couldn't keep up, he started to mentor a youth like him - a charming young hothead with a talent for flying.\n\nSecuring the equipment for the flyboy and a pension for himself, he enrolled on the NCRA to be a flight trainer. Ike wasn't the only kid he taught, but the only one he deemed worthy to carry his legacy. While he wasted his time with the "ostriches", he even secured himself the rank of 2nd Lieutenant.\n\nThat ended one day when David let his charge try a stunt he wasn't ready for, with tragic results. Since then, he carries the name of "Daedalus", as he let his "Icarus" fly too close to the sun. Under our employment, he tries to save our flyboys from the same fate."

They seemed to him to be the rebirth of the great Italian empire of the old-world, something he knew only from faded history books and kitsch pizzeria decorations. But after he joined it didn't take long to realize that there was no glory, only slavery, and there was no "Res Republica", only a dictator. He deserted and fled across the Colorado River, and joined the NCR to serve a nation he could feel pride in.\n\nHis departure with the Expedition didn't change much - his main job is to lead scout parties into Denver, so he can teach local recruits the joy of patrolling and wartime scouting."

His attitude changed, however, when the Great War happened. He ended up shutting down at the facility for a long time, and as the centuries passed, side-effects of being a Robobrain and the CODE protocol made him delusional. His memories and sense of self faded.\n\nThe First Colorado Expedition awoke him alongside Presper, but their conflict made him escape from the Dome and settled down at Robot City.\n\nWith the Second Expedition arrival, something called on him to join them in their adventure.

While there were no scholarships for aspiring hydromechanics, the NCRA always sought more volunteers to enlist. She quickly found herself with the Engineering Corps and was sorted into the 5th Engineering Company under the leadership of Major Briggs. The problems started to surface from there on...\n\nWhile their job was not particularly dangerous, usually involving logistics and sapper work, the 5th Company was unique. They were a saboteur-commando unit and used their knowledge of engineering to blow up both military and civilian targets for the sake of the Republic. While Major Briggs had no problem with that, Dianne was disgusted by such methods.

He served under the best commanding officer California could ever get, Ralph Peoples, sometimes referred to as "the Sheriff."\n\nWhile his superior's personal problems touched him, loyalty and sympathy were not the only reasons he followed him to Colorado.
