    bag_expedition_desc_desc:0 "The Expedition, while having one agreed goal to achieve, reclaiming the Boulder Dome, is mainly torn apart by the infighting of egos.\n\n§RThe Academics§! led by Dr. Goddard are the driving force behind the whole concept. They're scientists from the Academy or members of the Followers of the Apocalypse, and they want to rediscover and restore the Boulder Dome. Their posse contains students from the Academy as well.\n\n§gColeridge's Clique§! leader is none other than the General himself and the NCRA personnel loyal to him. The military detachment sent with the Academics mostly favour the General's vision over the scientists, even though it's not true for all of them. While they see the importance of the Dome as well, they have more ambitious plans with Colorado as a whole.\n\n§4Agnes' Posse§!. The mediator between these two massive egos is Dr. Agnes. While she is an ally of Goddard, she presents herself as the woman of the people and is widely accepted and respected by both sides. While she has no ambitions to usurp the power to herself, the "Tandi of Colorado" maybe one day find herself at the helm.\n\n§PThe Radiophobians§! are a ragtag band of bigots and mutant haters, and their backgrounds are similarly diverse. Traumatized soldiers, chem addicts, the Movement held minimal to no power in the Expedition. This didn't stop the Two Egos from using them for their own gain whenever it was deemed beneficial."

    bag_boulder_zax_desc:0 "The ZAX built deep inside the Boulder Dome is an older model. Perhaps even one of the original models. It lacks the data storage and computational power to do what we require. Still, it will form an effective base for our "Super-ZAX" unit. The purpose of Operation Thanatos is to redesign and rebuild the unit to support merging with additional ZAX units suspected to be in the nearby region. We're gonna need a lot of copper..."

    bag_paradise_zax_desc:0 "From what little we learned, the "Goddess" Diana was a pre-war human experimentally connected to the ZAX unit to save her life. For 200 years, it has succeeded. Now, it seems it will all come to an end. Her brain is unlikely to survive the disassembly process and transportation to Boulder."

While its original purpose seems to be related to managing the Vault and its inhabitants, this unit has been reprogrammed remotely. After severing the link and patching up any old security codes to prevent anyone taking control of our Super-ZAX, we'll transport it home for integration."

Maintaining law and order will be left in human hands. Its memory banks will be wiped and the computational power it possesses will be added to ours upon arrival."
