    nf_col.1.desc:0 "As the [ROOT.GetName], you have the opportunity to shorten or lengthen the fuse before the three-way war between the [BAG.GetName], [LUM.GetName], and [WHD.GetName] begin. Playing as the [ROOT.GetName], the Front Range Conflict is set to begin 365 days after the game starts.\n\nColeridge, as an avid military man wants to heavily focus on military preparation. This scares your neighbours, resulting in each of his foci shortening the time before the conflict begins, to a maximum of 180 days.\n\nAlternatively, Goddard, a man of science and patience, willing to save time by acting less frightening, can lengthen the conflict to the same maximum of 180 days.\n\nA careful player may find themselves with as much time given to them as Goddard's path allows, but at the cost of having less than stellar military before the conflict. Alternatively, though Coleridge's stratagem itself may start the conflict itself, his methods are well-tried, and may ultimately result in a better Colorado for all."
