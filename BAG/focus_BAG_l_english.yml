    bag_second_expedition_desc:0 "We have arrived here once again. The region might just be twice as deadly as it was before."
    #The Coloradan Powderkeg Focuses
    bag_empirical_method:0 "The Empirical Method"
    bag_empirical_method_desc:0 "We can't afford to go shooting blind. We have to be careful and sound out the situation, even if it means taking our time."
    bag_fund_galetskis:0 "Fund the Galenski's Grand Garage"
    bag_fund_galetskis_desc:0 "The Galenski family were always the most avid supporters of the Expedition. When we arrived on Coloradan soil twenty years ago, Eddie lent us his expertise and armoured truck, ensuring our safe travels to the Dome. Now, Old Eddie is a fragile man, but his kids continued his legacy. We could use their help again."
    bag_students_of_apocalypse:0 "Students of the Apocalypse"
    bag_students_of_apocalypse_desc:0 "Most of our scientific staff is comprised of students from the Academy and the schools of the Followers. They're engineers and programmers from all different fields, as well as medical experts and plague researchers. Their diverse skills will be essential to our survival."
    bag_civilian_cooperation:0 "Cooperation with the Civilians"
    bag_civilian_cooperation_desc:0 "Our main objective is securing the Dome, but if we use our old approach of forceful military occupation, we will surely fail. We cannot ignore the wishes and wellbeing of the locals. We will have to convince them that this fight is theirs, and if they choose our side, the Republic will thank them with benefits."
    bag_our_part:0 "Red to Red, White to White..."
    bag_our_part_desc:0 "The students we brought with us have vastly different backgrounds - most of them either engineers or programmers. Almost none of them have any practical knowledge in the field of medicine, but with the guidance of our doctors, they could save lives easily."
    bag_do_it_yourself_robotics:0 "DIY Robotics"
    bag_do_it_yourself_robotics_desc:0 "Dr. Goddard was always fascinated with the thought of robotic warfare. He witnessed protectrons in action while he was doing his research paper on Vault City's power plant. While we're not in the position to start up a robotic army just yet, we certainly can start with the parts we have."
    bag_welder_deal:0 "Deal with the Welders' Union"
    bag_welder_deal_desc:0 "Before Bares-his-Teeth drove out the ghouls from Dog-City, the "Welders' Union" were dominant here. A highly autonomous compound where people lived without much authority. Unsurprisingly they were effortlessly scattered by the ghouls, but a little splinter group lives on in our land. We could ask for their help."
    bag_welder_deal_tt:0 "§RBeware! The Welders' Union will cease their support if we're more closely aligned with the 5th Engineering Company!§!"

    bag_local_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "The Republic has arrived, people of Colorado! It can share its liberty and prosperity with you, if we can but drive the enemy away! Come and serve in the NCRACC, the New California Army Colorado Contingent, and secure yourself citizenship!"
    bag_fifth_engineering_company:0 "5th Engineering Company"
    bag_fifth_engineering_company_desc:0 "Led by Major Briggs, the 5th Engineering Company nominally does everything a normal army engineering team would. But they have a special talent and task; sabotage, usually of the explosive variety. They can make our enemies regret getting up this morning."
    bag_drill_greens:0 "Drill the Coloradan Conscripts"
    bag_drill_greens_desc:0 "The Expedition is woefully unprepared for this two-front conflict. There are many locals to recruit and conscript, but we'll need to give them some training."
    bag_dedicated_fireteams:0 "Integrated HCF Squads"
    bag_dedicated_fireteams_desc:0 "Let's integrate Briggs' "Heavy Cover Fire" teams into our battalions, that we may benefit from superior firepower and organization."

    bag_activate_fifth_engineering_company:0 "Activate the 5th Engineering Company"
    bag_activate_fifth_engineering_company_desc:0 "While we wanted to keep the Fifth out of the action, we have no choice but to pre-emptively activate them. Showing their true colours and skillsets will help through the oncoming struggle, even if we would prefer to keep one of our aces in our sleeve."
    bag_activate_fifth_engineering_company_tt:0 "§RBeware! The 5th Engineers' Company will cease their support if we're more closely aligned with the Welders' Union!!§!"
    bag_office_of_millitary_advancement:0 "Office of Military Advancement"
    bag_office_of_millitary_advancement_desc:0 "The Office of Military Advancement, or just OMA, is the vision of the NCRA's military clique. Coleridge, in conjunction with Lee Oliver back in the Republic, imagined a military body that sought to go beyond the restoration of old weapons and instead embraced building new and better ones. Out here, far from republican bureacracy, Coleridge will try to make this a reality."

    bag_our_administrator_on_field_desc:0 "[BAG.BAG_AGNES.GetName] is not only a great biologist and medic, but she is also a well-trained diplomat. Being modest and lacking ambition makes her a perfect administrator and civilian leader.

    bag_gamma_corps:0 "Organize the Gamma Corps"
    bag_gamma_corps_desc:0 "We need to utilize every asset at our disposal. The ghouls are the predominant people under our jurisdiction, and not recruiting from their ranks would be a waste. Especially since most of them are "oldies", ghouls from the Great War, and many have actual military knowledge."
    bag_local_leaders:0 "Promote Local Leaders"
    bag_local_leaders_desc:0 "Local people need to be led by local leaders. [BAG.BAG_ELI.GetName] was part of the Coloradan National Guard before the bombs fell. He joined the [WHD.GetName] like many other guard remnants, but grew dissatisfied with Old Dog's leadership. The Republic's arrival opened up a chance to finally make changes here for the better, so he volunteered to lead our forces against his old boss."
    bag_ghoul_reliance:0 "Rely on the Rotting Rangers"
    bag_ghoul_reliance_desc:0 "While it disturbs parts of our High Command, we'll need to rely even more on our ghouls. They're well-trained, reliable, and come in steady numbers. There's a chance that in the future this will bite us in the rear, but we have no other choice than to expand the Gamma Corps."
    bag_ghoul_reliance_tt:0 "§GUnlocks§! a new set of §YOutsider Laws§! for you to use!"
    bag_establish_outposts:0 "Establish Outposts"
    bag_establish_outposts_desc:0 "Our doctrine calls for well-defendable positions, and with our sappers in the field we should set them up quickly. We'll construct palisades, walls, bunkers and outposts in the towns under our jurisdiction. While protecting our borders is important, these settlements provide us with the supplies we need - they cannot fall."
    bag_access_radio_towers:0 "Access the Radio Towers"
    bag_access_radio_towers_desc:0 "Knowing your enemy is crucial to defeating them. Resurrecting the local radio towers will both give us great vantage points and a means of spying on the ghouls effectively."
    bag_access_emergency_stockpiles:0 "Access Emergency Stockpiles"
    bag_access_emergency_stockpiles_desc:0 "When we left Colorado last time, we left behind a hidden cache of weapons and other equipment. They're old and rusty, but it seems an emergency came earlier than we anticipated."
    bag_task_force_baggers:0 "Task Force Baggers"
    bag_task_force_baggers_desc:0 "The "Baggers", the original forces from the First Expedition, are our most experienced troopers in the field. We originally wanted to use their experience in the war room, but we'll have to expose them to another PTSD-inducing experience."
    bag_raise_medical_rations:0 "Increase the Medical Rations"
    bag_raise_medical_rations_desc:0 "The Boulder area, the Cheyenne region, and the far south town of Colorado Springs are all pulsing green with radiation. Terrain always needs to be accounted for, and until we find a permanent solution all we can do is increase the troops' medical rations."
    bag_utilize_radiophobians:0 "Utilize the Radiophobians"
    bag_utilize_radiophobians_desc:0 "Formed around the leader of the "Baggers Force", [BAG.BAG_LARSEN.GetName], the Radiophobians hate radiation and ghouls. They're potentially dangerous bigots, but we need their hate directed at our enemies."
    bag_plan_operation:0 "Be Prepared"
    bag_plan_operation_desc:0 "Our war room is unique in that military and scientific personnel share it, trying to ensure that one does not gainsay the other. However, a plan of action must be chosen."
    #
    bag_put_service_stuff_into_service:0 "The Call of Duty"
    bag_put_service_stuff_into_service_desc:0 "We're not just a bunch of soldiers. Labourers, sailors, truckers, and pencil-pushers also came with us to make this operation run smoothly. In desperate times like this, we could put guns into their hands."
    bag_ask_truckers_help:0 "Ask a Favour from the Truckers"
    bag_ask_truckers_help_desc:0 "The Truckers are old allies of the Expedition. While their primary role is in logistical support, we could ask to use their armoured truck for... a different task."
    bag_hire_junkies:0 "Hire Junkies"
    bag_hire_junkies_desc:0 "There is a shady individual by the moniker of "Lacerman". He hooks up ghouls and others with all different kinds of hard drugs. We never saw him or his goons, only of his handiwork - junkies and braindead ghouls scattered around. We could use them as cannon fodder."
    bag_recruit_civilians_for_sapper_work:0 "Recruit Civilians for Sapper Duty"
    bag_recruit_civilians_for_sapper_work_desc:0 "Among the locals are many with engineering talents. They may not possess the same skills as our military sappers, but they'll do in a pinch."

    bag_promote_our_heroes:0 "Promote Our Heroes"
    bag_promote_our_heroes_desc:0 "While the Expedition expected to face some hostilities, the Powderkeg that we set aflame was more than we imagined. Our soldiers, despite the odds, showed their prowess. It's time that we award them accordingly. Promotions and decorations are on the way."
    bag_civilian_oversight:0 "Establish Civilian Oversight"
    bag_civilian_oversight_desc:0 "These blood-soaked fields are ours now, and it will take considerable time and resources to rebuild them as they were. We cannot risk our new citizens backstabbing us, even if the reconciliation slows us before the road to Boulder."
    bag_land_of_glowing_ash:0 "The Coloradan Great Glow"
    bag_land_of_glowing_ash_desc:0 "The capital city of old Wyoming, Cheyenne, was levelled in the Great War. The Great Glowing Ones' cultists continue to infest the area. If we want to make peace with the people in the area, we will have to make peace with their... 'religion'."
    bag_land_of_glowing_ash_tt:0 "§gWe'll send a messenger to the §Y[GLC.GetNameWithFlag]§!. Their leader, the Glowing Father, leads a similar group to the §Y[LUM.GetNameWithFlag]§! and represents a less sinister version of their religion. If we could invite him to replace their "Great Glowing One", we could achieve peace in the region.§!"
    bag_guarantee_freedom_of_religion:0 "Guarantee the Freedom of Religion"
    bag_guarantee_freedom_of_religion_desc:0 "The freedom of religion is an elemental concept for law, even in the old world. Banning the local faiths would cause more problems than it would solve. Guaranteeing the ghouls their way of life is both ethical and practical."
    bag_guarantee_freedom_of_religion_tt:0 "§gIf §YGlow's Cradle§! accepts our proposal, you will unlock a new advisor!§!"
    bag_raise_temple_of_faith:0 "Raise a Temple for the Faith"
    bag_raise_temple_of_faith_desc:0 "The ghouls won't have to worship in secret. We will erect a temple for them, where they can listen to the words of the Glowing Father and do willing community work for the Republic!"
    bag_last_stand_of_all:0 "The Coloradan Broken Hills"
    bag_last_stand_of_all_desc:0 "We'll recreate that mingling of humans, ghouls and mutants here, far from the original. It will inspire others to put aside past prejudices and join us in striving for a better future."

    bag_enforce_mutant_law_of_2205:0 "Enforce the Mutant Law of 2205"
    bag_enforce_mutant_law_of_2205_desc:0 "The NCR passed these laws decades ago, and it mandates that ghouls and super mutants enjoy the same rights as anybody else. Enforcing most of them only requires adequate policing."
    bag_enforce_mutant_law_of_2205_tt:0 "§gThis interaction will yield better results if we already implemented higher levels of the §YMutant Recruitment§! policy. Our actions would appear more sincere and credible that way.§!"
    bag_contact_chinese_remnants:0 "Contact the Chinese Remnants"
    bag_contact_chinese_remnants_desc:0 "The most peculiar group in the lands of the Withered Dogs are the Chinese remnants. We have just enough skill in Mandarin to successfully cooperate with them. The Great War ended long ago, and we shouldn't let old mistakes spill new blood."
    bag_emancipation_of_ghoul_lands:0 "Emancipation of the Coloradan Frontier"
    bag_emancipation_of_ghoul_lands_desc:0 "We first conquered their lands, then we conquered their hearts. The ghouls of these lands are already our citizens, and we can expect them to support our cause to emancipate the whole region from tyranny - but most importantly, emancipate the Dome back under our control."

    bag_military_occupation:0 "Enforce Military Occupation"
    bag_military_occupation_desc:0 "Defeating our enemies on the battlefield was the easy part. Until we can reorganize the lands to follow our laws, we'll maintain a military presence. While that will not make the locals trust us more, it will be the safer option."
    bag_military_occupation_tt:0 "§O[BAG_GODDARD.GetName]§! resigns as the official leader of the §YColoradan Expedition§!, and §O[BAG_COLERIDGE.GetName]§! is named the new leader in his place.\n\n"
    bag_westward_expansion:0 "Westward Expansion of the OZ"
    bag_westward_expansion_desc:0 "The Expedition will expand the Occupation Zone westward next. Both radiation and Glowing cultists will inhibit our pacification efforts. We'll just have to get rid of it all."
    bag_ban_the_faith_of_glow:0 "Ban the Faith of the Glow"
    bag_ban_the_faith_of_glow_desc:0 "The cultists organized around this "Great" Glowing One are dangerous lunatics. They forcibly ghoulify people by nailing them to crosses next to their "holy site", a radiating hellhole. This depravity cannot exist under our administration - terminate their leadership and scatter their congregation."
    bag_operation_darnall:0 "Project: Darnall"
    bag_operation_darnall_desc:0 "Our localized de-radiation facility will be next to [249.GetName] to test out the newest solutions to the problem. The site fits perfectly for the job, as an enormous bomb crater filled to the brim with luminous water in the area. Clearing the poisonous lake will please the locals as well. Brigadier-General Darnall would be proud."
    bag_eastward_expansion:0 "Eastward Expansion of the OZ"
    bag_eastward_expansion_desc:0 "The Occupation Zone's expansion will continue eastward into the former lands of the Withered Dogs. Pre-war national guards, ghoul refugees from the south and even Chinese invaders are present. We expect a stiff resistance movement to form."
    bag_deal_with_national_guard_remnants:0 "Make a Deal with the National Guard"
    bag_deal_with_national_guard_remnants_desc:0 "Despite our original opinion of ghouls, the National Guard remnants seem like good folk. They fought for a good cause under the wrong leadership. We could integrate them into our forces."
    bag_finish_war:0 "Wrap Up the Yankee-Sino Conflict"
    bag_finish_war_desc:0 "The Sino-American War may be long over, but these ghouls seem intent on reliving it with us. Let's banish the spectre of Communism once and for all."

    bag_pacification_of_ghoul_lands:0 "Pacification of the Coloradan Frontier"
    bag_pacification_of_ghoul_lands_desc:0 "Most of Northern Colorado is firmly under control. Breaking down rebelling forces was Colonel Peoples' specialty. Dr. Agnes turned out to be a great administrator and compromiser. We're here to stay."

    bag_start_of_beautiful_friendship_desc:0 "This partnership started out more bumpy than we hoped, but it turned out to be better than expected. The various peoples of Black Canyon are great trade partners and even greater friends. This indeed seems like a start of a beautiful friendship."
    bag_mutual_defense_pact:0 "Mutual Defence Pact"

    bag_join_the_republic_together_desc:0 "We successfully connected with the Californian heartlands again, and we wouldn't be here without the help of our friends. The least we can do is vouch for them and help them join the Republic on their own terms."
    bag_introduce_far_go_traders:0 "Introduce the Far-Go Traders"
    bag_introduce_far_go_traders_desc:0 "The Far-Go Traders originated in the Hub like many others. They unofficially financed a large part of our expedition, and some of their representatives are present. Providing them with a new market would help everyone out."

    bag_showcase_gun_runner_merchandise_desc:0 "Unluckily, we don't have a hidden Gun Runner in our ranks, but we have their wares in our stockpiles. Not enough to make a difference, but enough to sell them and start a profitable venture with Black Canyon. Just don't tell them they're counterfeit. The quality is genuine, but the brand tags do not match."
    bag_shared_market:0 "Republicans' Market"
    bag_shared_market_desc:0 "Black Canyon was in a tight spot. They were pretty isolated in their mountains without trade funnelling in. Luckily, we happened by and maybe profited from it. Their reliance on us is the key to greater things."
    bag_joint_public_works:0 "Joint Public Works Programs"

    bag_dome_deal:0 "The Dome Gambit"
    bag_dome_deal_desc:0 "Agnes gambled a lot by asking a lot, but after some big promises that we may or may not be able to fulfill, they agreed to our terms. Maybe this will have dire consequences in the future, but the important thing is that the Dome is ours again!"

    bag_international_benefits:0 "International Benefits"
    bag_international_benefits_desc:0 "Quelling the hostile air, we finally began trade with the Glowbugs. As people can move freely through the border, both nations' settlements saw growth and migration, which ultimately was beneficial to everyone."
