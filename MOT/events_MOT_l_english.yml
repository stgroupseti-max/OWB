  nf_mot.1.t:0 "Marching Forth from Baker"
  nf_mot.1.d:0 "When 38 NCR citizens were slaughtered by raiders outside the Mojave town of Needles, the NCR Congress was quick to call for action. Then-President Tibbet was reluctant to commit troops to the area at a time when the NCR was already fighting costly wars in the north and west, but such an excuse fell on deaf ears in the Senate. Tibbet lost a no-confidence vote soon thereafter and was replaced by Wendell Peterson, who soon ordered three batallions of NCR Troopers to invade and pacify the area. \n\nIn 2274, following scouting by detatchemnts of NCR Rangers and the discovery of the mostly intact Hoover Dam, the Mojave Expedition's mandate was vastly expanded to cover the entire area from Needles to New Vegas. Reinforced with four fresh battalions and supported by two Ranger divisions, General Oliver marched from Baker towards the Mojave Outpost in March 2274 at the orders of the President to begin the \"Pacification of the Mojave\" and shape the Mojave for decades to come."
  nf_mot.1.a:0 "With Baker as a base, the expedition has solid foundations."
  nf_mot.1.b:0 "Years of fighting in the Southern Mojave had hardened all."
  nf_mot.2.t:0 "The Raiders of the Mojave"
  nf_mot.2.d:0 "While NCR Rangers had scouted the Mojave Wasteland in the years before General Oliver's march from Baker, they had done little more than provide an overview of key locations and factions to the General. Between the Mojave Outpost and the Hoover Dam there were a sum total of 0 friendly outposts, meaning that General Oliver had an uphill fight ahead of him if he wanted to establish clear supply lines to and from the Dam. \n\nThe first major settlement for General Oliver to seek to pacify was Nipton. Once a small community, Nipton thrived after the Great War as a refugee town and trader settlement. Specialising in drugs and prostitution, the town became a major hub for the Fiends' narcotics trade: with a healthy Fiends garrison to boot. Naturally, it became the first military target for the Mojave Expedition to contend with, and the tactics employed in the battle would influence later conflicts."
  nf_mot.2.a:0 "Troopers searched every house to esure the town was clear."
  nf_mot.2.b:0 "Once the bulk of the Fiends retreated, the town was safe."
  nf_mot.3.t:0 "Powering the Mojave"
  nf_mot.3.d:0 "When NCR Rangers first scouted the Northern Mojave in 2273, they stumbled upon a hulking concrete barrier stretching across the mighty Colorado. Unlike many of the river blockages in California, this one wasn't caused by a crashed plane or insane Supermutant: this wall was created long before the Great War by an America in her prime. Fondly dubbed the \"Old World Wall\" by the Ranger team that found it, the wall turned out to be none other than the great Hoover Dam: long presumed to have been reduced to ash in the Great War. Instead, the Dam stood infront of them in its full glory and without a crack along its surface. To the shock of the engineers the NCR scrabled to take a look at it, the Dam even turned on for them, producing power from two turbines with a dull buzz. It truly was a marvel. \n\nThe discovery of the Hoover Dam sent the NCR Congress into a frenzy. For decades, the NCR had struggled to provide power for even its major cities, let alone the countryside. Now, with the discovery of the Hoover Dam partially functional, the path to providing reliable and sustainable power to all of California was clear: if they could only get the other damn turbines working. Sure, they might have to send New Vegas 5% of the power they generated, but..."
  nf_mot.3.a:0 "With some \"miscalculations\", power sent to Vegas was minimized."
  nf_mot.3.b:0 "That was a fair price to pay for peace!"
  nf_mot.4.t:0 "Skirmishes with the Mojave Brotherhood of Steel"
  nf_mot.4.d:0 "When we first came to the Mojave, we discovered a chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel carrying out technology raids across the wastelands. They were far from home, and led by a somewhat fanatical and unpredictable chapter leader: Elijah. In the early days of our campaign we clashed with them on numerous occasions, but both sides knew the Mojave Chapter had neither the manpower nor equipment to contest our control of the majority of the Mojave. Instead, the Brotherhood took up residence on the site of HELIOS One, a pre-war solar array filled to the brim with the kind of ancient technology the Brotherhood obsess over.\n\nThe unstable status quo that settled into the Mojave can't last forever, even if both sides would lose from a prolonged conflict. However, under political pressure from Shady Sands, we've begun military preparations for §OOperation: Sunburst§!: a large-scale assault on HELIOS One with the intent of securing it for the Republic and wiping the Brotherhood from the Mojave. Noticing our preparations, the Brotherhood have started preparing too for the inevitable conflict. The balance of power between our two nations can be seen from our §OPreparation§!: the more preparation we have over the Brotherhood, the more effective our troops will be. The relatively small scale of the Operation means that every bit of preparation matters!"
  nf_mot.4.a:0 "Weakening their ability to perform requisition raids must be a priority."
  nf_mot.4.b:0 "We need to get to know them better, first of all."
  nf_mot.4.c:0 "Our only option is to destroy them. Make preparations."
  nf_mot.5.t:0 "Defending the Mojave"
  nf_mot.5.d:0 "While the Mojave Chapter may be defeated, and we seem to be temporarily safe from foreign threats, a sense of unease still settles over Mojave Defence Committee. Formed of the most talented military minds the Mojave Campaign has to offer, it offers advice for overall strategy to General Oliver, who has the final say on all military decisions within the Mojave. The Committee has always quietly grumbled about Oliver overriding many of their recommendations in favour of bold, flashy and prestigious offensives, but they are all loyal to the Republic and respect its chain of command. Following orders and disagreeing with them are very different things, however, and over recent months Ranger Chief Hanlon has begun to voice his discontent at Oliver's tactics, arguing a more cautious approach would save lives: a view which is echoed by others on the Committee. The two will surely have disagreements going forwards, especially as war approaches once more."
  nf_mot.5.a:0 "We need to keep an eye on this dispute..."
  nf_mot.6.t:0 "Supplying the Mojave"
  nf_mot.6.d:0 "The Mojave was far from hospitable terrain before the Great War. After it, great swathes of the Mojave became scorching, radiation-filled deserts. Movement of troops and civilians is difficult, and largely restricted to two major trade routes: Route 95 and the I-15. Even more difficult is the movement of supplies. Caravans are slow and bulky, and often have to navigate off established trade routes to reach outposts and garrisons in strategic, rather than convenient, locations. While we had enough supply to support the establishment and expansion of our current outposts, any future efforts to expand upon, resupply or establish bases will require the investment of supply. \n\nWe can gain supply through concerted efforts to do in our focus tree, or through negotiating for it from the NCR government. It can be used for various projects, available later in our focus tree. Additionally, one tenth of our supply is added to our attack and defense."
  nf_mot.6.a:0 "Compromises may need to be made."
  nf_mot.7.t:0 "The Great Khans attack Camp McCarran"
  nf_mot.7.d:0 "The Great Khans, a tribal group that has resided in the Mojave Wastes for years after being expelled from California, has long been a thorn in our side. Since our arrival in the Mojave, we have been in constant clashes with their forces wherever our troops are garrisoned. Their warrior culture is incredibly strong, and they make good wariors as a result, costing us dearly in skirmishes. Over recent days, however, their attacks have increased in frequency. Today, this came to a head when an entire Khan Warband launched an assault on Camp McCarran. \n\nThe attack left a bloody toll on both sides, with our troopers being forced to abandon much of the courtyard and retreat into the main terminal. It was only thanks to Rangers hastily redeployed from the Hoover Dam that the Khan advance into the camp was halted. Sensing their momentum had run out, the Khans made a quick retreat, taking a significant number of supplies in the process. It seems the Khans will become a real issue..."
  nf_mot.7.a:0 "This must not happen again."
  nf_mot.8.t:0 "Conquest's Bitter Aftermath"
  nf_mot.8.d:0 "The forces of the Mojave Expedition, led by General Oliver and spearheaded by Chief Hanlon's Rangers, has held most strategic points across the Mojave for months now. After the defeat of the Mojave Chapter and signing of the Treaty of New Vegas, the Expedition faces no organied military opposition. However, as the NCR's war-weary troopers are just discovering, beating the Brotherhood and occupying a handful of settlements was the easy part of the campaign. Despite some bold inititives, Oliver's Mojave Expedition has been more or less unable to actually \"pacify\" the Mojave. Organised military opposition may be eliminated, but supplies are far too sparse to heavily garrison settlements, and raider groups move freely and rapidly across the Mojave every day. To cap off the bleak picture is the ever growing threat posed by Caesar and his Legion on the far side of the Colorado: drawing even more on the Expedition's stretched resources. \n\nWith the list of objectives vast, the Mojave Defence Committee has been assembled to deliberate over the question of the \"Second Campaign\". On the one side, General Oliver advocated for a continuation of current policy: offering limited garrisons to settlements where necessary, but prioritising local autonomy to save manpower. Chief Hanlon, meanwhile, seeks a more radical policy of withdrawing the bulk of the Expedition's forces to a series of hardpoints—Hoover Dam, Camp McCarren and a variety of smaller camps—while leaving settlements to their own devices. There is little appetite for Hanlon's strategy back home, but considering the Expedition's mandate is \"Pacification, not Emanciptation\" there's a good case to be made for his tactics. The debate will rage late into the night..."
  nf_mot.8.a:0 "Without the support of settlements, we will perish!"
  nf_mot.8.b:0 "We simply don't have the manpower to spare."
  nf_mot.9.t:0 "A Coming Storm"
  nf_mot.9.d:0 "A great conflict is coming. From the Mojave Defence Committee to the lowest NCR troopers, everybody knows that a mighty foe lies across the Colorado. Our camps across the Colorado have already clashed with this foe multiple times, and it is only a matter of time before they are assaulted in force. Their objective will be, without doubt, the Hoover Dam: what better way to please a warlord than capturing one of the greatest man-made structures in America for him? We've long known that conflict will come to the Hoover Dam, but not the direction it would come from. Now, we can start making a concrete plan for the defence of the Dam from the Legion's hoards, and the Mojave Defence Committee is brimming with ideas on how to fight them off effectively. \n\nThe two strongest voices, General Oliver and Chief Hanlon, have rallied supporters around their two contrasting ideas. General Oliver advocates for the total defence of the Hoover Dam, fortifying it significantly and funneling the Legion's overwhelming numbers into a narrow area. Chief Hanlon, meanwhile, believes the Dam to be poorly defencible at best: instead, he believes the real fight will be over Boulder City, where the Legion could be tricked into an explosive trap. Both ideas have their strengths and weaknesses, but only one can be approved by the Committee..."
  nf_mot.9.a:0 "The Dam Must Hold!"
  nf_mot.9.b:0 "Fortify Boulder City"
  nf_mot.10.t:0 "Dust and Debris"
  nf_mot.10.d:0 "Explosions. Earth-shattering explosions. We could feel them from the Hoover Dam, and doubtless even from Shady Sands. Before our very eyes we watched the Divide's very ground twist and deform, rendering the entire valley completely impassable by human life. The cause of the explosions is unknown, but the strong radiation leaking out of the valley implies it must have been none other than nuclear missiles deep under the ground. Hundreds of lives, from caravan guards to NCR troopers, are surely lost in the tragedy. To make matters worse, one of only two supply routes into the Mojave is now completely unusable."
  nf_mot.10.a:0 "The Long 15 is our only hope now..."
  nf_mot.10.b:0 "Assemble a squad of Rangers: there must be a way through!"
  nf_mot.11.t:0 "Burn the House Down"
  nf_mot.11.d:0 "It appears that rebellious elements in Vegas have killed House! With his defeat, perhaps we can take advantage of the disaster and occupy New Vegas?"
  nf_mot.11.a:0 "We have more pressing priorities than Vegas..."
  nf_mot.11.b:0 "With House out of the way, our path to Vegas is clear!"
  nf_mot.12.t:0 "The Tables are Turning"
  nf_mot.12.d:0 "When we first ventured into the Mojave, New Vegas lit up bright in the sky. Mr House and his robots, egar to meet us, ventured forth from the walls of the city to our camps on the Hoover Dam, telling tales of their golden city: the jewel of the Mojave. While House's Securitorns seemed fierece, they were few in number, and House's only other allies were rag-tag groups of tribals that had become the \"families\" of New Vegas. It seemed, should the Expedition want to, New Vegas could be relatively easily conquered: certainly at no more of a cost than the Operation Sunburst. The order to conquer New Vegas never came, however. Instead, the Treaty of New Vegas was signed, guarenteeing New Vegas independence and 5% of the Hoover Dam's power output. The treaty made some sense: faced with the Mojave Brotherhood, raider groups and the growing Legion threat, the NCR simply could not afford another powerful enemy. \n\nThe circumstances now have changed ever so slightly. No longer is the Mojave Brotherhood much of a threat, and the immediate threat imposed by raider groups has been reduced, strengthening our position somewhat. Moreover, fresh divisions have joined the expedition. There is an argument in the Mojave Defence Committee, championed by General Oliver, to continue our military build-up and by consequence dwarf House's power: dissuading him from ever attacking. Chief Hanlon instead argues that we should look for allies amongst the \"families\" of New Vegas, possibly even leading to backing a pro-NCR coup in the city. Bringing New Vegas into the fold would be a huge victory, but also risks making enemies of a powerful foe."
  nf_mot.12.a:0 "With a numerical advatage we can dissuade any attack."
  nf_mot.12.b:0 "Reach out to some of the \"families\": we may have some allies."
  nf_mot.13.t:0 "Divide and Conquer"
  nf_mot.13.d:0 "Disturbing rumours have been circulating on the strip for the last few days: rumors of dark money and illegal weapons being smuggled across Vegas' mighty walls. According to the few sober sources we can find, it seems that the weapons are being run to a variety of New Vegas' families for seemingly little reason. The origin of these weapons and caps seems even tougher to find, but we have some reason to believe the guns may come from none other than NCR Rangers themselves! \n\nIf these facts can be corroborated, they'll pose a serious change in policy from the Mojave Territories, and may even indicate an attempted coup is on the horizon. Regardless, the weapons threaten to destabalise the delicate balance of power between the New Vegas families. We best be careful."
  nf_mot.13.a:0 "Worrying to say the least."
  nf_mot.14.t:0 "The Ranger and the Robot"
  nf_mot.14.d:0 "Ever since the NCR established the Vegas Embassy, we've suspected the company it hosted was not entirely friendly. Indeed, we had strong suspicion that the NCR were running an undercover Ranger detatchment from the building, right under our noses, to try and infiltrate our ranks. We've never been able to prove it. \n\nThis morning, just outside Goodsprings, a very special person was arrested and detained by an NCR Ranger squad. One of the many Couriers we sent to deliver to us the Platinum Chip, Courier 6 was the most reliable Courier to date. Alas, even they seem to have been unable to avoid the Bear's watchful gaze, and the Platinum Chip he was carrying has been confiscated. Sources inside the NCR inform us that it's being swiftly moved back to California, under heavy guard. \n\nThe Courier's arrest and the Chip's confiscation mean only one thing: that the NCR knows of its importance. With our plans for the Bear and the Bull now in tatters, we need to carefully consider how to proceed. Our securitron army alone may be enough for us to overwhelm the Mojave Expedition's forces, allowing us to capture the Hoover Dam and the chip. It's a risky move..."

  nf_mot.15.d:0 "Bakerfield has been under martial law for years as part of the Mojave Expedition's remit. But with their increasing control of the Mojave, the territory has been returned to civilian rule. It is only a matter of time before we extend the same liberties to the rest of the Mojave . . . and perhaps, beyond."
  nf_mot.15.a:0 "To the torch of the Pacific!"
  nf_mot.16.t:0 "Oversight Rejected"
  nf_mot.16.d:0 "The Mojave Territories have largely acted as a nearly independent army up until now. With limited federal oversight, despite our continuous support, many called for an investigation and report on the current state of the Mojave.

Sure enough, after Motor-Runner's death three leaders rapidly sprang up: the infamous Violet, Cook-Cook and Driver Nephi. Countless squadrons of NCR Troopers have been dispatched over the months since our capture of the Vault to attempt to bring the three to justice, but none have been successful. Almost all we send end up dead, and those that survive are usually so scared they wish they were slaughtered alongside their friends. For months now the works of these three have tied up vital men and equipment that could be much better used against the Legion or Vegas. So infamous were the trio that the Republic even set the so-called \"Three-Card Bounty\" on their head, offering 250 Caps for the confirmed kill of any individual and a bonus 300 Caps for the elimination of all three. The leaders truly are a menace. \n\nMore accurately, they were. Following an intervention today by a combined taskforce of the 1st Recon, an elite sniper team, and the Baja Brothers, the most experience Ranger assault for in the Republic, all three have at last been put down in one fell swoop. It sure as hell wasn't easy even for such a formidable fighting force: 12 good soldiers were lost in the fighting. With their deaths, however, we've freed up much-needed manpower that would otherwise have been tied down for years to come. Thank God."

Perhaps that is a bold claim of me to make, but it's true nonetheless."\n\nOliver beckoned towards the cameras pointed towards him, making sure they caught every word of what he was now about to speak. "That is why I am no longer a general. Your general. I am now taking over as head of state, with the absences of the previous Presidential candidates. I know not if they are in hiding, missing, or are no longer with us."\n\nWith that, he took off his military cap, replacing it with a high-cap military hat. "From now on, I am your President-General. A former subordinate of mine had a similar idea, but she went about it in the wrong way, as so many in what she called the 'Third California Republic' unfortunately have experienced. I know not when the NCR will begin holding Presidential elections, or what our future holds, but as President-General, your President-General, I ensure to see to it that our Republic comes out of hibernation into a brave new world, bigger and better than ever.""

  nf_mot.35.d:0 "Hanlon angrily drummed his fingers on his desk, his Ranger handset ringing Oliver for the third time that day. Oliver had made yet another announcement to the people of the Mojave, this time bragging about his 'Bear Armor' project, and how much of a boon it would be in his quest to restoring the NCR.\nHanlon began to rant to himself. "C'mon, you blowhard, you're so confident when dozens of eyes are staring at you, but you can't even-" A click ended his thoughts, indicating that the call had been picked up. "General, so glad you finally decided to pick up."\nSilence came from the other end of the line, followed by a single word. "Speak."\n\nHanlon took a breath. "General, with all due respect, this campaign was meant to pacify the Mojave, we were never meant to restore the whole of the NCR, we didn't even know how an electoral deadlock could happen until it smacked us dead in the nose."\n\nWith no reply, Hanlon continued. "We're losing at least a thousand men on the Dam alone per year, not counting isolated deaths from Fiends, Brotherhood, raiders, Legion, and God knows what else. We've been here for... what, 5 years now? That's 5,000 men, to begin with. How many more are you going to send to die before you give up on this asinine dream?"\n\nThe silence continued to grow. "...Lee, just please, stop this. Let these men go home. They don't deserve the deadlock, but keeping them here is just as bad, if not worse."\n\nHanlon let out the breath he had taken in a heavy sigh. "Fine, be that way. At least honor a final request I have. Too many men and women have died on our watch for us to tear them apart to prove which of us is right. Just you and me, settle this issue like men.""

What NCR was there left to celebrate or even hate?\n\nMemories of Rattletail, of Baja, of Elise, flooded back to him. The lies he had to tell, the indoctrination of honor and survival at any cost, words of the NCR being the greatest nation to ever serve.\n\nBunk. All of it.\n\nHe considered playing around with putting the empty revolver up to his head and pulling the trigger a few times, but decided against it. Instead, he reached for a special Ranger radio handset. In a time like this, sometimes one must make a deal with the devil.\n\nEven if the devil happens to be a brunette.\n\nOn the other hand, devils are one thing, but he could always go with becoming the angel on the shoulder for someone else, or at least having an angel on his shoulder..."

  nf_mot.37.d:0 ""I can't accept this." Hanlon said quietly to himself, having dressed himself in formal wear for the event he was about to attend.\n\nThe Third California Republic had won. Oliver was dead. Calhoun was either dead or imprisoned. Only Moore remained.\n"Showtime, Mr. Hanlon." The gruff voice typically emitting from Cassandra Moore's mouth was gone, instead replaced with a faux regal tone, learned specifically for tonight's event.\n\nWalking out of his impromptu dressing room and into the ceremonial chamber of what once had been the NCR Hall of Congress. Men and women, soldiers and Rangers alike, clapped and cheered for him. Although the Hall of Congress was still undergoing repairs, the roof had been left open, looking out into the clear night sky, with stars shining over the ceremony. Hanlon only wished he felt as bright as the stars looked.\nHe put on a smile and waved to all his brothers and sisters in arms, thanking all of them by name whenever they called out to him. After the third dozenth greeting, however, he simply kept silent, as he arrived at the podium.\n\nCassandra Moore stood, dressed in her regal uniform, which had been decorated in purple and gold lining for the night. She quieted down the room, tapping the microphone.\n"Tonight, we are gathered to honor Ranger Chief Hanlon. He bravely stood against the false delusions of Lee Oliver. He singlehandedly held back the Legion at Hoover Dam. He is a hero to all of California, and a shining example to all of us. Thank you, Josh Hanlon. It is my pleasure to award you with an award only fit to give such a man of honor."\n\nA medal, depicting the Pre-War state of California, with the insignia of the TCR acting as a crowning jewel. In bright letters, it read 'Hero of California'.\nAs the medal was hung around Hanlon's neck, he felt he may as well have been putting himself in the executioner's noose. He had become his own worst enemy, and had done nothing to stop it.\n\nFireworks flew from behind the building, lighting up the night sky. But all Hanlon felt was a crushing darkness surrounding him..."
  nf_mot.37.a:0 "The night seemed to go on forever."

  nf_mot.38.t:0 "Against The Tyrant?"
  nf_mot.38.d:0 "Hanlon found himself in a familiar place. Sitting in his room, staring at his Ranger Sequoia. Once again, he stared at the boldened gold letters adorning the barrel. But what good did words of encouragement do when the NCR Rangers, who were supposed to be 'Against All Tyrants' were now serving a tyrant?\nMoore was deranged, she had declared herself the President-General of the Third California Republic. She had brought in a deluded young fool who made himself into more of a slave devoted to Moore's every whim than being a proper mayor, now Governor-Lieutenant, of the TCR. Not to mention that Moore now had an incessant goal to go beyond Kimball, to crush Caesar, to conquer the Southwest, to go beyond where the NCR had ever gone before.\n\nThe aged Chief thought back to his initial thoughts of why he had decided to go with Moore in the first place, and not Calhoun. Calhoun may have given rise to Caesar indirectly, but he was a healer and a helper first and foremost. Moore was a genocidal maniac, and an imperialist furthermore. But he ended up going with Moore because he thought he had to make a deal with the devil to become the angel on her shoulder.\n\nWhat an angel he had been. Getting a worthless medal with an equally worthless title about betraying those he had once cared about most. And while the TCR celebrated, as much as they could under Moore's new regulations, he was alone. He couldn't go to the Rangers with his thoughts, they'd report him to Moore, or have him court-martialed for treason. He couldn't even leave the TCR. What good would running to Texas do when it would fall under Moore's boot sooner or later?\n\nThe Sequoia was loaded this time, it was no longer empty. A better man would have refused the temptation. But Hanlon was no longer the better man. He couldn't even consider himself much of a man anymore, he was nothing more than a soulless puppet for Moore. A pawn in her sick games. No more."

  nf_mot.39.t:0 "Requiem For A Ranger"
  nf_mot.39.d:0 "Hanlon's body had been discovered mere hours after taking his own life, and only a short amount of time after having received his medal. Moore alone knew the likely reason why Hanlon took his own life, but she refused to compromise the stability of her nation, rather, she spun the suicide into being a carefully thought out plot by foreign elements to rid the TCR of their hero.\n\nMoore and Hayes stood next to one another as they watched Hanlon's casket be lowered into the grave. Moore had ordered that a 30 foot hole be dug in order to bury the body. Once the casket had been lowered, the hole was filled with concrete, as cranes carrying the metal monument to the Ranger Unification Treaty approached. Once the concrete had settled, the monument was placed over Hanlon's grave.\n\nMoore looked to the thousands who had shown up to Hanlon's funeral, as well as to the tens of thousands more who were affected by it.\n\n"There are no words that I can say that will properly recognize the man. So instead, I will tell you the truth. Hanlon was a great man, bigger than many of the rangers he served with and commanded in heart and mind. Bigger than those he served under, such as the blowhard Oliver and the tax whale Kimball. But now he is no longer with us. Taken away by the plot of a foreign interloper, who recognized Hanlon's meaning and significance to this great Republic, and decided to undermine our nation by taking away his God-given right to life, freedom, and happiness."\n\nMoore slammed her fist on the podium. "I will not rest until the foreign elements who are suspected to be responsible are brought to justice." Rehearsed tears began to stream from her eyes, as her voice carefully broke to ensure maximum false sincerity. "Hanlon meant so much to me, to all of us. I only regret that the MONSTERS who took him away from us have no compassion, no heart, no mind, to understand the hellfire they have just brought upon themselves.""

  nf_mot.40.d:0 "James Hsu and Julie Farkas stood at the McCarran control tower, preparing for the announcement. For weeks, they had been scoping out soon-to-be-former General Oliver's futile efforts to stop and apprehend any loyalists to the new Followers government of the NCR. He continued to maintain, in propaganda speeches that dwindled in both length and attendance, that the New California Republic Army's declaration of martial law and attempts to restore the NCR in the Mojave Territories was the one and only option the people and army in the Mojave had.\nHsu and Farkas, however, knew that it would only be a matter of time before Oliver and his contingent of loyalists went berserk and attempted to stage a violent coup. All they could do now was stand over the ham radio and listen.\n\nA voice broke through the radio silence: "Followers Team 1 in position, what are your orders?"\n\nHsu kept his face calm. Looking over to Farkas, who nodded, he bent down to press the transmitter button of the radio. "Apprehend the General, read him his rights. We've prepared a cell for him here at McCarran. I want only non-violent methods taken. Your weapons remain unloaded, correct?" A grunt of acknowledgement.\n\n"Going in now, sir and ma'am."\n\nSounds of a door being broken down, of Oliver angrily asking who they were and who sent them, only to suddenly recognize their Followers garb and insignia. "So, they've finally come for me. You won't get the satisfaction, you sons of bitches! Do you know who I am? I know the President!"\n\nA struggle, with shots from Oliver's .44 heard from the room. A pained grunt was heard, followed by a shallow breathing. "I... won't let you... have... the satisfaction..." The breathing ceased.\n\nThe radio crackled with another soldier's voice. "He... tried headshotting me, I tried to wrestle the gun out of his hand, but the fool kept pulling the trigger, even as it was pointed towards him... I'm sorry.""

Although no one could know where Henry had gone off to beyond Henry himself, he had thankfully left a copy of his terminal and medical notes with Marcus, whom had entrusted Farkas and the Followers with them.\n\nFarkas began gently. "How are you feeling, Lily?"\n\nLily had been given full dosage of the medicine, injected via the single remnant of the Enclave Stealth Boy 3001 Mk II.\n"Why dearie, I... I... don't quite know. Why did I call you dearie? I don't even know who you are."\nFarkas knew one of the unfortunate symptoms of Lily's illness, as written in Henry's notes, was that of her faded, but still present, memories as a human grandmother of two in a Vault. But it seemed that the medicine was working, as sad as it was for a grandmother to lose her memories of her grandchildren.\n\nMarcus' voice came over the earpiece Farkas was wearing. "I believe this is satisfactory for the time being. Return to the main hall."\n\nOn returning, Marcus looked forlorn, an unusual expression for the typically stony mutant. "Lily was a special case for all of us. Recalled things we couldn't. Saw things we didn't. Made her special. She's still special, just not the way she was before."\nFarkas nodded sadly, looking at the ground of the ski lodge.\nAs Farkas began the trek to the door, Marcus held his large hand up. "Fore you go, got a debt to pay."\n\nWalking over to a long-unused locker, Marcus pulled out an aged, yet pristine, chaingun. A faded logo identified it as a 'Rockwell CZ53 Personal Minigun'.\n\nMarcus wrenched the minigun around his arm, testing the RPM. The gun spun in a blur. "Helped me, may as well help you. Lady tyrants aren't much better than male ones, a friend showed me that back when. Keep the peace in the Mojave, could help out when you call for it."\n\nFarkas, open-mouthed, simply nodded once more. "I'll have a Ranger stop by to drop off a radio. Thanks, Marcus.""

The one who ordered my release visits me at last, what can I do for you, boss? Fix a toaster? Repair some guns? Maybe fiddle around with some electrics at Hoover Dam?"\n\nHsu looked curiously at the Ghoul. Although he was certainly acting genuine and friendly, his demeanor only seemed to be masking an additional caveat.\n"Tell me, who are you?"\nThe ghoul chuckled a bit. "As I was telling your men yesterday, name's Raul Alfonso Tejada, aka Old Miguel, former gunslinger, sole survivor of Hidalgo Ranch, and ghost of Mexico City at your service."\nHsu's eyes widened slightly. "Gunslinger and ghost? Certainly could use one of those around the Mojave these days."\nRaul shook his head. "Nah, ain't nobody got a use for an old vaquero like me. Bosses like you can at least go around ordering people. Still got the outfit though, could give some other soldier the fancy duds."\n\nHsu rubbed his chin. "You say you are a sole survivor. and ghost. Ghosts typically have a reputation in Old World folklore for not leaving the physical realm as long as they have unfinished business. Perhaps returning to the life of a... 'vaquero', as you called it, may be that calling?"\n\nRaul mulled Hsu's words over.

The area, now infamously dubbed \"The Divide\", once was a major NCR supply route between Shady Sands and the Mojave. Now, thanks to a number of mysterious nuclear detonations from dormant silos across the valley, the ground itself has become twisted and malformed. Still, the NCR hoped there would be a safe way through for their supply convoys, and so the Rangers were dispatched. \n\nA week has now passed since the NCR's last contact with the Rangers. While they managed to survive longer than any scavengers that ventured into the twisted land, reporting back to Ranger HQ about the horrendous nuclear storms and ghoulified troopers patrolling the wrecked land, it still seems unlikely they will ever return from the hellscape again. The Rangers have been officially declared \"Missing in Action\" by the NCR, and a military funeral will be held in Shady Sands in their honour this weekend.

While the uneducated observer may see the treaty as greatly beneficial to the NCR, House has used the treaty to fleece thousands of NCR troopers and citizens of their hard-earned caps, and given him breathing space to begin to restore New Vegas to its glorious past. The NCR, on the other hand, grumbled that it should be the one to own New Vegas, but in the face of the Mojave Brotherhood and Legion they could do little but agree to the terms. \n\nFor years, the treaty has stood without incident: until today. In an official announcement from Mr House himself on Radio New Vegas, it was announced the treaty would be annulled with immediate effect, citing \"an act of espionage\". Securitrons also moved to close down the NCR embassy in the city and expell all NCR troopers from the Strip, in a move sure to provoke retaliation from the NCR.
