  EHT_focus_thunderbird_desc:0 "Not all of the Eighties are happy to stay in Utah. Thunderbird, one of the greatest warriors of the tribe, calls for his warriors to drive West into California and claim their birthright. At the epic feasts and races he duels in car and word with [EHT.GetLeader].\n\nThunderbird calls the elder a 'cunt-bitten coward, naturally weak. Dismal-eyed and anused, as Kneelers on the racks. Renounce, remorse, your rhymes and sorry shrieks. My car's exhaust can make a sweeter sound.'"

  EHT_focus_wendover_exchange:0 "The Gold Hills Exchange"
  EHT_focus_wendover_exchange_desc:0 "We can welcome caravans at Gold Hills, instead of relying on sporadic trader contacts. This will only encourage commerce and prosperity. Perhaps we can do more than raid."

  EHT_focus_nomadic_flexibillity_desc:0 "In one of our frontier raids to Arroyo we discovered a cache of grav plates near an abandoned Chryslus Highwaymen.

  EHT_focus_war_for_mountains_desc:0 "We will need to learn how to go off-road to face some of our foes. Equipping our best warbands with all-terrain vehicles should do the trick."
  EHT_faith_in_the_roads:0 "The Culture of the Death Run"
  EHT_faith_in_the_roads_desc:0 "The Death Run is just as much a cultural phenomenon of the Eighties as a religious experience. Committing great deeds in your vehicles, such as winning head-to-heads in the countryside or drag races on our circuits, not only brings you great glory or fanfare but also helps connect your soul to your machine."

  EHT_ally_mormons:0 "Subjugating the Canaanites"
  EHT_ally_mormons_desc:0 "Now that Thunderbird has taken some of our best warriors, we are left in a bind. Fortunately, New Canaan, a city ripe with wealth yet militarily feeble, presents an opportunity. Instead of direct hostility, we will guise our control as an alliance. Subtly leading them against the White Legs and driving them into our arms. Over time, we can earn their trust, then prey on it for our own gain."
  EHT_propose_mormon_alliance:0 "Feigned Alliance"
  EHT_propose_mormon_alliance_desc:0 "By feigning interest in their safety, we can manipulate the Canaanites into a so-called alliance. Their naivety regarding our intentions allows us to exploit their wealth and strategic position, all while planning their eventual subjugation."
  EHT_old_ferry:0 "Prelude to Control"
  EHT_old_ferry_desc:0 "The Western Dockyard, under our influence, becomes a crucial node in controlling New Canaan's trade. This move not only boosts our coffers but also tightens our grip on the Canaanites' economy."
  EHT_eastern_dockyard:0 "Exploit Western Trade"
  EHT_eastern_dockyard_desc:0 "With the Western Dockyard operational and under our sway, we exploit its capabilities for our benefit. It's a strategic leap towards the economic subjugation of New Canaan, disguised as mutual progress."
  EHT_western_dockyard:0 "Eastern Trade Domination"
  EHT_western_dockyard_desc:0 "What the Canaanites see as an alliance is but a prelude to their subjugation. As they grow increasingly dependent on us for trade and security, we weave our influence deeper, setting the stage for complete control over their wealth and assets."
  EHT_join_mormon_alliance:0 "Treaty of the Lake"
  EHT_join_mormon_alliance_desc:0 "The Treaty of the Lake, while outwardly a pact of mutual benefit, is heavily skewed in our favor. New Canaan, under the guise of protection, offers us significant trade advantages and concessions. Their desperation for security has led them to a deal that greatly empowers us, at minimal cost. It's a cunning victory for the Eighties, exploiting New Canaan's vulnerabilities while masking our true intentions of eventual domination."
  EHT_utah_war_delay_trigger_tt:0 "If we try to ally §Y[WHT.GetNameWithFlag]§! or §Y[NCN.GetNameWithFlag]§!, they need to either accept and enter into an alliance with us, or they must reject us."
