    EHT_FURIOSA_NAME:0 "Furiosa"
    EHT_furiosa_army_chief_desc:0 "§y"I was discarded once because they believed I was useless. This pushed me to be the baddest bitch north of Colorado."§!\n\nIn the past, there was a woman who called herself Bassa. She was left in the desert to die, deemed a waste for the second time by her slave-keeper. At first, they realized that she was barren, so she couldn't bear any child to raise to be slaves, and second, while Bassa was forced to work in heavy labour, she lost one of her arms to an incident. Bassa died that day.\n\nShe could have had many other futures for herself if someone from New Canaan or the tribes of Utah had found her, but it was not meant to be. A war party of the Eighties found the woman and, admiring her will to survive, they took her in. When they asked her name, she called herself Furiosa, like an avatar of Wrath come from Hell to the surface.\n\nThey taught her how to shoot, drive, and pillage - and soon enough, she earned herself a title as well, "The Harpy". Today, she stands as one of the most skilled commanders of the Eighties and, without a doubt, the most furious."
    EHT_MAJOR_KALASHNIKOV_NAME:0 "Major Kalashnikov"
    EHT_major_kalishnakov_army_chief_desc:0 "§y"I served in the army once I did. I probably know best how deeply their corruption and the unspeakable horror of their actions going down. And they call us monsters?"§!\n\nMajor Kalashnikov had a rich life until this point. He grew up on a farm in Northern California, close to the border of Nevada. As the only kid in the region, Kalashnikov moved from the back of a brahmin into an arms workshop to make ammunition for the army, a craft he performed so efficiently that the city boys named him "Bullet Farmer" for it.\n\nHe spent his youth there, and then at the first military draft, he joined the NCR Army, where he was sorted into the freshly created Motorized Corps. He quickly rose and climbed the ladder, as his unit's main objective was keeping in check the biker gangs of the Sac-Town area, which the "Bullet Farmer" was especially qualified for.\n\nHis new turning point in life came when his superior made an order to run down and kill the escaping Eighties band - elders and kids alike, so no seeds of the tribe should survive. The Major was shocked, disgusted even, and without much hesitation, he refused to follow the order and even killed his superior officer. He destroyed everything he had built in a single moment, as his sense of justice clouded his mind. In his last action as the officer of the NCRA, Kalanshikov told his troops that he would join the escapees, and if any wished to follow him in his exile, they should floor the gas pedal.\n\nSince then, using his exceptional skill in field command and large-scale strategy, he became one of the more feared commanders of the Eighties. If the Major leads a war party, the enemy should pray to any god willing to hear their pleas should they dare to oppose him."

    EHT_MASTER_BLASTER_NAME:0 "Master Blaster"
    EHT_master_blaster_high_command_desc:0 "§y"It's simple, really. I'm the brain, he is the brawn, and together - we're a beauty."§!\n\nMaster Blaster's name is very much misguiding, but for good reason. For to understand it one must know the story of two men rather than one.\n\nThe Master, on the one hand, was born with dwarfism that left him physically unremarkable, but an outstanding intellect. He was the mind behind multiple successful heists in New Reno before the ground grew too hot for him, and he decided to change the scenery.\n\nOn the other hand, Blaster was an honest man with honest work - he was a plumber, maintaining multiple water pumps and pipes around Northern California. This changed when he was caught in the middle of one of Master's schemes and forced to play the role of the fool. He lost everything, his family, his money, his reputation and his chance for an honest life.\n\nHe accompanied Master since, and the two became inseparable, and while they're together, they're unstoppable. The two make for a surprising sight in battle, Master riding on Blaster's back in a man-saddle! Master never told Blaster of is connection to his downfall, though, as he is well aware that this is all which keeps him alive."
    EHT_TOECUTTER_NAME:0 "Toecutter"
    EHT_toecutter_high_command_desc:0 "§y"One man does what he needs to do to survive - and while I came to terms with that idea, I still chose a path that makes it somewhat more tolerable."§!\n\nToecutter is one of the most experienced members of the Eighties, riding together with Flagman when they were only a minor nuisance around the Sacramento area. They were still young then, stealing and breaking stuff and living the high life of the rowdy kids of the street.\n\nHe got his name from his bleeding heart, unwilling to kill innocent civilians and bystanders having been orphaned himself from a drive-by robbery. No, he prayed on the other lowlifes of the area, be they the mobsters of New Reno or the slavers of the Den. It came with a sense of justice, a task for which he could consider himself a Vigilante instead of another terror on the streets.\n\nThis, of course, changed as time went on, and became irreversible when they rode out from Sac-City. Today Toecutter is the most ruthless of the bunch, and for the misfortune of all in the Great Basin, he is just as cunning and capable as he is bloodthirsty."

    EHT_WINDWAKER_NAME:0 "Windwaker"
    EHT_windwaker_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§y"There are lots that you can learn from the people of the past. Their triumphs and their mistakes as well."§!\n\nWindwaker once was one of the Followers of the Apocalypse. She joined their ranks as a young girl when the people in white reached her village, and they healed the terrible sickness that was upon her family. While she wanted to be a Medicine Woman one day to return to her town and help them in the same fashion, she was more interested in ancient history than curing the sick. Windwaker took particular interest in what little records remainged telling of ancient Rome and their greatness - their engineering marvel, military tactics and the multitude of ways they bent the knee of the Gauls.\n\nWhen the Eighties rode out into the Utah wasteland, she joined them soon enough, as she felt she could be of great help there. Reflecting on her motives, she realized she did not want to help anyone from the goodness of her heart. Instead she sought to be revered, respected, feared even. And where easier could she reach her goal than where empires are born?\n\nWindwaker studied the Roman chariots and the Roman tax system thoroughly, and learned lead her troops to victory in any circumstance, her quick wit having no match anywhere. And then, after they make tributes of the survivors? Nobody will rebel against her. There is a fine line between slavery and serfdom, and she always finds it. Every, single, time. She is Windwaker, and with her arrival comes the storm."
