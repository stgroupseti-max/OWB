  LIV_leader_name:0 "Glenda Close"
  LIV_leader_desc:0 "Glenda Close, once the vibrant and eccentric First Doctor of the Newton Reaver Movement, dreamed of becoming one with the technology she revered. But during the Midwestern Brotherhood's war against the Menace from the West, those dreams turned to nightmares. Captured by Barnaky's loyalists, she and her tribe were transformed into cyborgs through cruel experiments, stripped of humanity and individuality. The sacred union she had envisioned became a hollow mockery, leaving her a grim shadow of the person she once was: a tool, not a person.\n\nAfter the First Brotherhood Civil War, Barnaky's regime was overthrown, and the machinery that created the Cyborg Reavers dismantled. Glenda and others were finally freed, but freedom brought its own burdens. Living in Epsilon, Glenda drifted between roles—doctor, decker—her sharp mind and enhanced body overshadowed by grief for her lost community. Watching her non-augmented kin age and die, she longed for the belonging she had lost.\n\nWhen Glenda heard of the Live Wires, a new Reaver Movement out west, hope reignited. The group sought to unite those scarred by Barnaky's reign and reclaim dignity. Glenda eagerly joined, ready to rebuild her tribe and herself. Though her eccentricities had dimmed, her spirit endured. Among the Live Wires, she found renewed purpose: to honor the past and shape a future where neither technology nor humanity would overshadow the other."

  liv_cyborgs_of_epsilon:0 "The Cyborgs:\nBarnaky's Forgotten Army"
  liv_cyborgs_of_epsilon_desc:0 "The Cyborgs of Epsilon were born from Barnaky's vision of a purified Brotherhood—a force of super-soldiers engineered to be fearless, emotionless, and physically unstoppable. Designed in the early 2200's in the aftermath of the war against the Menace from the West, these cyborgs were intended to be the ultimate weapon against the Mutant threat. Recruited—or more accurately, harvested—from raiders, tribals, and captured Reaver camps, they were subjected to invasive procedures and psychological conditioning. Their bodies were reforged with advanced cybernetic frames that halted aging, enhanced strength, and granted unparalleled resilience. But the cost was immense: their emotional capacity was dulled, their individuality stripped away, and many struggled with the dissonance between their human minds and mechanical bodies. They were not warriors—they were tools, waiting for the command to be unleashed.\n\nBut that command never came. The First Brotherhood Civil War erupted before Barnaky could deploy his super-army, and his regime crumbled before the Cyborgs ever saw the battlefield. With Barnaky defeated and the machinery used to create them dismantled, the Cyborgs were deemed obsolete and quietly discharged. Many were left to aimlessly wander Epsilon’s underground, outcasts in a society that had no place for them.\nRecently, a growing number of these displaced souls have found a new calling among the Live Wires—a Reaver Movement offering not just a home, but the hope of rediscovering their purpose and reconnecting with a community that understands their pain. A chance to wipe the slate clean, and try to move away from their shared historical trauma."
  liv_new_epsilon:0 "The City of New Epsilon"
  liv_new_epsilon_desc:0 "The Ironhorn Tribe, with support from the Sisters Movement, has recently successfully petitioned the Elder Council of the Midwestern Brotherhood to officially support the development of New Epsilon as a dedicated home for the Cyborgs. In a rare show of solidarity, the Elder Council has allocated scrip funding to spread awareness of the Live Wires Reaver Movement throughout Epsilon's underground. Additionally, transportation services have been made available for Cyborgs unable to afford transit, ensuring that every displaced soul has an opportunity to find a new home among the Live Wires, if they so wish.\n\nNew Epsilon is being developed with advanced Midwestern construction techniques, reflecting a blend of efficiency, durability, and adaptability. Despite its relative youth, the city already stands as a testament to post-Great War civic organization, with reinforced structures, modular infrastructure, and sustainable resource systems designed to support long-term habitation. Every building, street, and utility network has been meticulously planned, ensuring that New Epsilon not only serves as a refuge for the Cyborgs but also as a shining example of Brotherhood engineering prowess in the Wasteland."
