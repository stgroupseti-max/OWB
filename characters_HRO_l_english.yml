  HRO_HOUSTON_GOVERNING_BODY_DESC: "As the bombs came hurling down from the sky we once called ours, we hurried down into the bunkers. Leaving all the blueprints for the next generation of nuclear propulsion on our desks. For years we started up at the concrete ceiling, retracing our steps among the stars in white chalk. It was decades before the all clear was given from the Marshall, letting us return to our homes, our old lives covered in dust and rusted beyond repair. It was in that dust that we left our dreams of the one more small step in favor of any clean water left on earth.\n\nOrder had to be regained, the ashes could not rule society forever; the newest mission was to re-establish a permanent human presence on earth. The walls went up and the purifiers started to turn, brick by brick the years of neglect were rectified. However, there are those divorced from the past that look back at our missions with glowing eyes. Edward Baldwin and his Rocketeers won’t let their eyes stray from the magnificence of the heavens."
