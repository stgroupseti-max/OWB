  BOS_JONATHAN_MAXSON_NAME: "Jonathan Maxson"
  BOS_JONATHAN_MAXSON_DESC: "Jonathan Maxson, a man burdened by the weight of his lineage and the scars of his harrowing experiences, has found himself thrust into a position of leadership within the Maxsonian Elders of Lost Hills. Following the sudden demise of High Elder Jeremy Maxson, Jonathan reluctantly assumed the mantle of authority, despite recent doubts about his physical and mental well-being stemming from a recent near-fatal encounter.\n\nDescended from the esteemed Roger Maxson, the revered founder of the Brotherhood of Steel, Jonathan carries the legacy of his family's storied past. Before becoming High Elder recently, as a high-ranking paladin, he fought valiantly on the front lines just outside the borders of the New California Republic. However, his heroic efforts were tragically cut short, leaving him marked by both visible and invisible scars, which many Scribes are predicting he may perish from if he does not treat them with urgency.\n\nJonathan's survival, albeit at a great cost, has raised concerns among the Elders. Questions linger about his ability to bear the responsibility of leadership, given the traumatic experiences he endured. Not only this, but even his wife, Jessica, plans on sending their only child, Arthur, out east, to the protection of Star Paladin Lyons' Brotherhood in D.C. Yet, it is precisely this history of sacrifice and personal struggle that shapes Jonathan's vision of the future of the Brotherhood. Maxson's are men of resilience and determination, driven by a profound sense of duty to honour the legacy of their shared ancestor and protect the ideals they and the Brotherhood hold dear. Some would call them the elitist hardliners, determined to follow the Codex to the letter no matter the cost. Jonathan sees it as a small price to pay for honouring the very man he owes his name to.\n\nWhile Jonathan may carry the burdens of his lineage and the scars of battle, he possesses a resilience and inner strength that sets him apart from the Rhombians, Cultists, and Reformists, maintaining an almost-religious dedication to upholding the principles of the Brotherhood and ensuring the safety of all people under the name of Maxson. Despite the doubts and challenges he faces, Jonathan is determined to forge his own path and leave an indelible mark on the future of Lost Hills"
