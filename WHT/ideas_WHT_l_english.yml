The New Canaanites hoard their laws, their paper-magic, their false peace—but peace did not save the old world! They steal from traders and call it 'tax.' They take from the weak and call it 'justice.' They hide behind their walls and whisper that we are lost.\n\n§RBut we are NOT lost.§! We remember. We know what the wasteland demands. We know the cost of this life. The old world was judged weak and cast into fire, and the wasteland will try to erase us just the same. But we are §Rnot§! the old world. We are §Rnot§! weak. We will §Rnot§! be judged unworthy.\n\n§RThis is the order of the world. This is the way of our people. This is how you survive.§! They will wither. They will fade. But the White Legs will remain."

  WHT_widespread_illiteracy_desc:0 "In their prolonged isolation, the White Legs developed a dialect totally unique to their tribe: a mix of English, Spanish and Shoshoni that speaks to the diversity of their people of origin. This does strengthen the tribe's sense of identity, but it is ultimately a pidgin language, and as such does not lend itself well to any communication that is not spoken. Naturally, this makes education and diplomacy--neither of which the group have much interest in to begin with--very lofty pursuits. For scavenging raiders not eager to embrace the outside world, these problems are manageable, but unless they can be remedied the White Legs will struggle to amount to much else."

Some effort has been made to rectify this and improve the literacy of the tribe, but they will take time to bear fruit."
