       GAM_forgotten_children_desc:0 "While most of the current members of the Gator Maws were born in Alexandria or its neighboring towns, a fair handful of our best folks come from elsewhere and sign on for various reasons. Our current boss Sobek actually came from Lafayette, and her main buddy Daren was born in the Bluff just west of it. While we're not gonna go pretending to be friends with just anyone who stops by, we'll be a bit softer on kids wandering through, and we'll even try to show 'em the ropes if it's clear they're willing. And if not? Well, some of the younger slaves like pretending to be mothers and fathers; let them have kids to dote over if it means they work harder. The kids'll be raised as slaves too, as an added benefit."

       GAM_bandit_brothers_desc:0 "The reality of the Texan-Louisianan border is that this land is generally a lawless place. Everyone's free to rob each other, and so on and so forth with that ideological bullshit. The fact of the matter is that whoever's got the biggest gun wins the argument. Unfortunately, currently the Brotherhood has the biggest gun, and they're trying to bring Law and Order to the area. Much as it pains us to work with the douchebag desperados and the cannibal-sympathizing Carthaginians, we might just have to if we're gonna stand a chance against the Brotherhood."

       GAM_hidden_in_the_sand:0 "Hidden in the Swamps"
       GAM_hidden_in_the_sand_desc:0 " The one thing most attacking forces really never seem to understand is how hard it is to dislodge a bunch of fighters in the middle of a swamp who're willing to get just a little bit money. We've pulled the 'cover ourselves in mud and wait for a guy to shoot' trick against quite a few opponents, the latest of whom were the Lafayette Patrolmen. The Brotherhood must be new to this kinda fighting—let's show 'em the ropes!"

       GAM_CAR_trade:0 "The Carthaginian Exchange"
       GAM_CAR_trade_desc:0 "We've only gone and bloody done it! Sobek the Powerful and her very own Gator Maws laid the Texan Brotherhood low and saved the future of the region with one fell swoop! MAN was that a satisfying fight. Those power armor freaks sure do squeal when you poke and prod them in the ribs without their armor to protect them. Anywho, we don't really need or want to deal with Texas, so we've hoisted that mess on the old Carthaginian exiles, and they've agreed to pay us a monthly tribute for the next few decades or so. It'd be quite a chunk of their cash a few scant years ago, but now that they've got Dallas to plunder, they'll probably be able to manage."

       GAM_tribute_desc:0 "While we didn't exactly expect this outcome to be possible, it seems we've been given our land back by the Gator Maws of Alexandria. It's kind of a shame, really; we put up a hell of a fight in the initial combat against the Brotherhood, and we probably almost won before they got lucky and took our cities out from under us. Regardless, deal's a deal, and that Sobek girl's clearly not someone worth messing with for now. We'll put up the pretense and fork over some cash on the monthly. Then maybe we'll stop someday. Free country and all that."

       GAM_dead_texas_desc:0 "So, y'all remember how Texas was causing all those problems for us and everyone else around us? Bastard just decided one day Dallas wasn't enough for them and tried to take everyone out? Well, they failed! We've only gone and done the impossible—the Texan Brotherhood must've tripped on an overgrown root, because they got shanked in the swamps around Alexandria and never recovered! Now that things are starting to return to normal, we can pause and take a look around ourselves. And hey, it turns out we've earned a fair bit of respect for outlasting the Brotherhood like that. Let's turn it into some real loot! Y'know, through raids. Yeah, big whoop."

       GAM_revenge_desc:0 "With the Texan mess no longer a thing to worry about, let's move on to the real fun! Sobek's got a few personal grudges that need taking out, and she's made it clear to the rest of the gang that we're gonna go have a bit of fun. The whole Texan mess was the real fight; this is just the afterparty, really.."

       GAM_gator_gang_idea_desc:0 "Having united west Louisiana under raider rule, the Gator Maws of Alexandria have rebranded themselves into the Great Gator Gang, a personal touch of their leader, the recently crowned Gator Queen Sobek. Running a hefty slave operation out of The Cannery and utilizing a small captured fleet to ship goods from Lafayette to the rest of the major Gulf cities, the region has become an impromptu fish cartel under the iron control of a slightly-insane teenager. While we're not sure if she's smart enough to catch Shrimp, this will most definitely have an effect on the trout population"
