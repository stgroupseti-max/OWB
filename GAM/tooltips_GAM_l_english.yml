If Texas met its end in some other way, no need to get fancy about it; we'll just throw a big party and hang some captured folks to celebrate. And if any of those other bandit bands are still around? Well, maybe we can invite them over to celebrate too.§!"

GAM_crown:0 "§g"How about this. I'll wear the stupid crown on a few conditions." Cheers went up from the tightly-crowded room. \n\n"First of all, the Gator Maws aren't a tribe. We're a gang. Get that through your heads, the lottaya. Got it?" \nSome people towards the back made sad noises, but most of the gang members shouted points of affirmation. \n\n"Secondly, y'all gotta call me the Gator Queen from now on." \nUniversal shouts and whoops went up from the crowd. This was playing right into a cheesy legend that'd been going around Alexandria for a century, but if it would put a rest to the legend for good, it'd be worth it.§!"
