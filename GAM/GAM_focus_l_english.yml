   GAM_gator_gang:0 "The Rise of the Gator Gang"
   GAM_gator_gang_desc:0 "Way back in the day, Alexandria was a respectful city. Not big enough to get nuked in the Great war, not small enough to fall apart afterwards. But what a nuke didn't do, a hurricane shortly after the bombs dropped managed. By the time the Gator Maws came to Alexandria, the place was a wreck and a shadow of its former self. It took a fair bit of time to fix it up, and our ancestors needed all the help they could get."

   GAM_enter_maw:0 "Into the Jungle's Maw"
   GAM_enter_maw_desc:0 "Over time, the folks in Alexandria slowly drifted away from their original reasons for settling there. The streets got dangerous at night, and feral children ran rampant without any regard for the health or safety of their neighbors. In a city founded on crime, it wasn't long before things fell apart. That's when the Gator Gang really came into its own, and things only went further downhill from there."

   GAM_fatty_fatty_no_parents:0 "The Orphan Girl"
   GAM_fatty_fatty_no_parents_desc:0 "With the old tribal leader Claw drowned in the mud of a back alley, there was a period of time where the Gator Maws really didn't have any organized leadership. They weren't sure if they were bandits in a syndicate or tribesmen in a clan, or somewhere in between. From the somewhere in between emerged Sobek, one of the youngest girls of note in our history and by far the nastiest lady you'll meet this side of the Mississippi."


   GAM_across_the_river:0 "The Boys Across the River"
   GAM_across_the_river_desc:0 "It's pretty clear which way the winds are turning, if you're willing to turn around and take a look. Over in Texas things have reached a boiling point, and the heavily armored Brotherhood folks running the show in Dallas have stopped turning a blind eye to our lovely freedom out here across the swamps. Well, let's at least try and stall them for a bit by hiring some mercenaries from Orleans to throw their lives away for a quick buck."

   GAM_left1:0 "Unwelcome Homecoming"
   GAM_left1_desc:0 "Well, looks like it's time for the grudge match Sobek's been hoping would happen for quite a while. The Lafayette Patrolmen march for the swamps of Alexandria, and hoo boy, are we gonna show 'em what happens when they come to our swamps. Sobek is personally looking forward to wiping that stupid smirk off Patrol Chief Callahan's loathful, unattractive face."

   GAM_left2:0 "The Bloodied Badge"
   GAM_left2_desc:0 "With hundreds of dead men in bloodied blue and gold laid out before her, Sobek declared her bitter childhood properly avenged. Now what? Well, that's a lotta bodies to deal with. Let's just strip 'em for what they're worth and send the rest down the river."

   GAM_right1:0 "Swamp Things"
   GAM_right1_desc:0 "The main strength of the Bayou Motors lies in their coastal patrols, supposedly. There's not too many of them—The Cannery is a rather small settlement, after all—but the Motors can afford some of the best equipment around with all their fish money. Let's give 'em a good spook and send some kids to steal a bunch of transports right out from under their noses."

   GAM_right2:0 "Our Natural Habitat"
   GAM_right2_desc:0 "Admittedly, it's been a solid year or two since the last gator got seen in public outside the breeding pools. Whenever one gets seen they tend to get shot to pieces for trophies faster than you could ask a Patrolman to gun down an innocent stranger. Fortunately, there seems to be no shortage of the mean greenies off the coast of Marsh Isle, so that's handy. Let's see about sorting out some of the folks here and getting production back online."

   GAM_pragmatic:0 "Bein' Pragmatic"
   GAM_pragmatic_desc:0 "Carthage is first up on the Texan chopping block, and out of everyone the Brotherhood is likely to attack in the little love-hate gang friendgroup we've got goin' over here, Carthage is the most likely group to have a genuine shot at layin' the Brotherhood low. Let's send them everything we can give."

   GAM_paris_is_such_a_stupid:0 ""Paris" Is Such a Stupid Name"
   GAM_paris_is_such_a_stupid_desc:0 "Assassin City is next up in line for the Brotherhood's ire. Knowing those wimps, there's a decent chance they decide to join the Brotherhood instead of fighting, but maybe sending some fighting folks their way will help convince them to stand and survive. Maybe."

   GAM_biker_friends:0 "Gettin' Biker "Friends""
   GAM_biker_friends_desc:0 "We've had quite a few scuffles with the Desperados of Shreveport in the past, to the point that normally we'd consider them our number one priority enemy. But over the last few years since Sobek took over, she's turned our anger towards Lafayette and our fear towards Dallas. Let's do our part to see if the bikers can hold just a little bit longer than those other fools out west."

   GAM_mobsters_loan:0 "Takin' a Mobster's Loan"
   GAM_mobsters_loan_desc:0 "Well, we're guessing we're up next for a war of survival with the degenerate knights of Texas. These lands are ours, and they were our parent's lands before us. And we killed our parents so they're our lands by right. Isn't Texas big enough for the lottaya!?"

   GAM_gator_friends:0 "Beasts Of The River"
   GAM_gator_friends_desc:0 "For as long as anyone can remember, the Brazos has been lousy with vicious gators. Our crew is the only one tough (read: crazy) enough to consider putting a collar on those overgrown reptiles and putting them to work."

   GAM_river_kings:0 "Feeding The River Kings"
   GAM_river_kings_desc:0 "Our oh so friendly beasties have been feasting lately, what with all the blood in the water these last couple years. Bigger and badder than ever, it's a good thing we found some books on keeping large animals in line..."


   GAM_our_turn:0 "Aight, Now It's Our Turn"
   GAM_our_turn_desc:0 "Welp, it had to happen eventually. Texas marches with thousands of men into our home swamps. Sobek's pissed, but we're pretty sure even she's a bit scared of what'll happen if they win. For the boss's sake, let's give the Texans a fight they'll remember!"

   GAM_tired_of_texas:0 "Everyone's Tired'a Texas"
   GAM_tired_of_texas_desc:0 "Turns out there's a lotta folks who've headed our way since the Brotherhood went on their warpath. Some of Carthage's finest warriors made their way to our humble swamps and pledged allegiance to Sobek on the conditions of good pay and an eventual restoration to their rightful homes. The Gator Gang's been taking on as many allies as we can find for a fair bit now, so of everyone offering to join us, this seems like a no-brainer."

   GAM_streets_reference:0 "Some Cannibal Remnants"
   GAM_streets_reference_desc:0 "While cannibalism is a sickness we've put firmly in our rear view mirror, there are still a few traditionalist cannibals over in Texas hoping that the Brotherhood falls so they can return to their disgusting old ways. Under normal circumstances we wouldn't dream of even humoring them when we could just kill them and take their stuff, but these aren't exactly normal circumstances. Let's bring 'em on and kill 'em later if we live."

   GAM_somekinda_reference_that_i_dont_remember_at_the_moment_this_name_is_so_long_lets_see_how_long_we_can_get_it_to_go_before_i_get_bored_right_about_now_what_a_coincidence_yipee:0 "You're a Nuisance to my Plans!"
   GAM_somekinda_reference_that_i_dont_remember_at_the_moment_this_name_is_so_long_lets_see_how_long_we_can_get_it_to_go_before_i_get_bored_right_about_now_what_a_coincidence_yipee_desc:0 "We did it! Even Sobek the Powerful seems to be surprised at the success with which we held Alexandria against the great foe, but Texas is no longer a threat. The Carthaginian exiles are heading home, and things are looking like they'll go back to normal. Only difference? Now we've got a fresh raiding ground with far less power armor sitting around with loaded pistols. Perfect!"

   GAM_intrusive_thoughts:0 "Hey, Might as Well"
   GAM_intrusive_thoughts_desc:0 "Now that the big issue of Texas has been dealt with, Sobek's got a few personal scores she's been waiting a long time to settle. She's since come of age by the standards of her old home, and what better way to celebrate that than by conquering her old home and burning it to cinders? Everyone loves a good homecoming speech by the fireplace."

   GAM_fuck_them_kids:0 "I've Got an Orphanage to Burn"
   GAM_fuck_them_kids_desc:0 "After so very, very long away from her old home, Sobek's comin' back! Lafayette's been a nice, sleepy city for so long, we're sure they wouldn't mind a bit if we came down south and woke them up a little. After all, what's a lawman without his bandit to fight? And we're the baddest bandits around, so it oughta be a fun time."

   GAM_FREE_FISH_YAYAYA:0 "Ain't Never Said No To Free Fish"
   GAM_FREE_FISH_YAYAYA_desc:0 "With Lafayette firmly in our grasp, we might as well go all the way and seize The Cannery down by the coast as well. I mean, some of Alexandria's forefathers were pirates, right? What's the issue with leaning into that a little? If we had a port, we could turn it into our own little pirate haven and start makin' serious cash from there."

   GAM_wear_the_crown_pls:0 "The Swamp's Gang"
   GAM_wear_the_crown_pls_desc:0 "Well, that about settles it. We turned back Texas, we burned Lafayette, and we've taken the Cannery for ourselves. What a perfect excuse to throw a party and crown Sobek the Gator Queen!"
