  ##CHARACTERS
  TLR_ethan_oneil:0 "Ethan O'Neil"
  TLR_ethan_leader:0 "Foreman of the Masons, Ethan learned his trade from his mother, who learned it from her father, and so on back to well before the first concrete pour of Vault 55. While coming from a well respected family and winning the Supervisor elections of 2268 and 2272 by a strong majority each time, the truth is he never wanted to get into a leadership role in the first place. Building structures one block at a time was always his first love, and he'd still be doing it today if he hadn't lost both legs to a feral ghoul attack in '63.\n\nStill, Ethan is a steadfast leader, wholly dedicated to protecting the Last Redoubt from foes within and without. This is proving ever more important as greater dangers begin to stir in the Plaguelands. Some, however, are questioning his leadership, claiming that continued isolation behind their walls won't be enough forever."

  TLR_annabella_cross:0 "Annabella Cross"
  TLR_annabella_leader:0 "As steady a hand with organizing the workplace as she is with welding, Annabella Cross, Foreman of the Ironworkers, was a natural choice for the position after her predecessor passed away unexpectedly. A strong believer in open and honest conversation, her door stays open to members of every Trade, winning her support from many different groups within the Redoubt.\n\nDespite personally being on good terms with Ethan, Annabella announced her intention to run for the position of Supervisor early on. She's come to believe that the Redoubt can't keep on alone, no matter how strong its bastions, and only by looking beyond its borders can they one day connect to the people outside the Plaguelands. Perhaps, with aid, they can even end the Blue Flu and their isolation once and for all."

  TLR_leo_maldonado:0 "Leo Maldonado"
  TLR_leo_leader:0 "The youngest Foreman on the Council, head of the Electricians, Leo is known for a quick temper, a quicker wit, and a rare knack for electronics and computers. In a country with relatively few computers and robots, he's almost undeniably the expert of the nation on both. Balancing his administrative duties with his endless tinkering in the workshop, constantly seeking new knowledge while constrained to the fortifications of his homeland, Leo is the leading proponent for radical new policies of expansion. Indeed, his unexpected bid for the Foreman position seems to have been for the sake of pushing back against Ethan's seeming policy of betting everything on their defenses.\n\nDespite his inexperience with tradeshop politics, his win shows a growing discontent among some with the current path of leadership. Rallying those not content to sit back while the Plaguelands reaches a turning point, he's thrown his hat into the 2276 Supervisor election hoping to turn the tide before the Redoubt becomes trapped within their own walls, unable to prepare for the coming conflicts."

  TLR_blissful_johari_bayha:0 ""Blissful" Johari Bayha"
  TLR_blissful_leader:0 "Growing up observing the peoples' growing discontent and fear surrounding the Last Redoubt's uncertain future, Johari became disillusioned with the tired old motto of "Work First." That disillusionment, in turn, gave way to a habit of scheming, lying, and backstabbing. Johari spent the greater part of her young adulthood running scam after scam, though few of them panned out beyond paltry paydays.\n\nShe would eventually be run off by local Union Officers from the Hall of Grievances, forced to make her way out of the Redoubt and into the harsh Plaguelands. She continued to survive, in spite of the danger, through her usual methods of deception and trickery, eventually finding her way to the Satisfaction Pharmaceuticals Corporate Headquarters and R&D Laboratories.\n\nWithin the ancient halls of Satisfaction, she would come across documentation of a powerful mind-altering medication known as GRIN. Collecting as much of the drug- and information on it- as she could, she returned to the Redoubt with her discovery and began peddling it as a cure-all for all of the woes plaguing the world.\n\n"Step right up, friends, and let me put a smile on your face."\n\nFinding mild success in the Redoubt, she quickly saw the potential to grow an empire by taking advantage of the addictive qualities of the euphoriant. Striking out in search of fortune -and more- she began a long journey throughout the whole of the Plaguelands, offering up GRIN to every settlement she managed to weasel her way into. Her greatest stroke of luck- or perhaps genius- was finding a reliable client in the Order of Saint Joseph of Omaha. \n\nEventually, she would go on to amass a flock of devoted and obedient disciples, eager to forget about their pain, and the harsh reality of Nebraska. As the richest woman in all of the Plaguelands, she buys and sells to her heart's content. Who could guess what her next moves might be?"

  TLR_amalthea_saigner:0 "Amalthea Saigner"
  TLR_amalthea_economic_desc:0 ""Very nicely done, Foreman Juneau. We won't be needing you any further. A magnificent performance. It's a shame you had to leave the stage so early. Unfortunately, I don't care what Johari’s end goals are, I can't have anyone standing in the way of this delicious experiment. Don't worry, however, I'm an expert, after all. In just a moment, you shouldn't be feeling anything anymore. That is, of course, unless I've miscalculated the dose."\n\nA native of the Redoubt, Amalthea was born to the Saigner family, made infamous by the unexplained- often messy- deaths of her ancestors at the hands of the Redoubt's many machines. At the age of 16, she had already graduated from trade school and was fast tracked through to the Nurses Union, praised by her peers and superiors for her advanced intelligence and deep curiosity surrounding the work of healing, but especially medicine. Unfortunately for the people of the redoubt, her intentions in studying chemicals of all kinds were anything but kind. She spent night after night dreaming up nightmarish concoctions in the chem development lab, poring over ancient documents scavenged from old warehouses. It didn't matter to her what the function of the chemical was, she delighted in testing them. Under her guidance, the chem lab would come to be known as the "Lab Mouse Morgue" among the lesser nurses. It wasn't long after the name spread to the Foreman that Amalthea's work was put on hold indefinitely, she herself relegated to simple care under the watchful eye of other doctors and nurses.\n\nHer research wouldn't stay on hold forever, however, as one "Blissful" Johari Bayha would contact her with the offer of a lifetime. "Develop this for me, and you'll have whatever you want." It was, of course, child's play, if not endlessly fascinating. A Euphoriant designed to addle the minds of its users, and so effective. The chance to work on GRIN alone was enough to enthrall her, but the testing it would need, that was her real ambition. How many variants could she craft? How many effects could she manage to develop from this base structure? She accepted the position as Johari’s right hand woman, eager to unleash her wonderful, awful creations upon the Plaguelands. If she was honest, however, whether it had been Johari, or someone else entirely, to offer her the job didn't matter. Any moron would have done, so long as she could continue her tests and development."

  TLR_remy_stjohn:0 "Remy St. John"
  TLR_remy_army_chief_desc:0 "A mercenary of a thousand tales, each less likely than the last, but captivating stories all the same. Protecting gun shipments for the remnants of the People's Front, defending a town from raiders with metal limbs, rationing his last bag of Radway fighting ghouls in irradiated ruins, killing a dozen hopped up Electorals with eleven bullets, a long night crawling in the mud to escape Power Armor patrols of "the true American government", breaking bread with a khan from the far off coast of the Pacific, the sun breaking over lakes greater than the whole of Redoubt territory, surviving backstabbing bandits and taking payment owed from their corpses. \n\nWhatever people think of the validity of his stories, his skill with the plasma defender on his hip and cool head in the thick of it are undeniable. \n\nNow he's come to the Plaguelands, entering through one of the few dangerous ways past the wall, seeking an unknown prize on behalf of a wealthy Manitoban benefactor. Almost a year in the territory has seen him earn some local trust protecting the Redoubt for food and board, and he's become the unofficial leader for outlander mercenaries in the Redoubt. The days are dragging on with no sign of his goal however, and as much as the place has grown on him, a contract can't last forever..."

  TLR_charles_hartworth:0 "Charles Hartworth"
  TLR_charles_army_chief_desc:0 "A Redoubter born and bred, Charles took years to find his calling. Terrible with a hammer, avoided electricity for his own health, and down right dangerous with a blowtorch; it wasn't til he got caught defending his hometown from a raider attack that the young man found his place in life. Rising to the occasion, Hartworth soon after began seeking out all he could learn of firefights and leadership, "apprenticing" with local defenders across Redoubt territory. Now many years older and many more wiser, he's a respected voice and the closest thing to a "General" the Union employs. \n\nGruff and distrustful towards outsiders from beyond the Wall, he spends his days now trying to build support for further military funding and organization for the Redoubt. In his eyes, they have for far too long overly relied on local defenses and mercenaries to keep the people safe, rather than dedicated soldiers."

  TLR_garth_dhusgrolin_name:0 "Garth Dhusgrolin"
  TLR_garth_high_command_desc:0 "A friendly man born and raised in the Forgehold of Gimli, Garth had what his Ma and Pa had always referred to as an "overactive imagination". It wasn't until he was nearly an adult that they began to suspect something more serious was at play, as their son had not left behind his long rants of things that moved between shadows. Of ghouls and demons in the corners of their home, threatening to kill them if left unattended.\n\nHis rants alone had already earned him the ire of most of the other folks living in Forgehold. However, shortly after he had reached adulthood, his delusions got the better of him and his negligence resulted in an accident involving a beloved leader and the maw of a machine. This spelled the end of his time in the Forgehold of Gimli. He was driven out, forced to wander the wasteland, spouting his nonsense about demons threatening to invade and control humanity, kicked out of every town he ran across until he finally had nowhere else to go but the dreaded place of no return: the Plaguelands. Passing through one of the few gaps in the wall that had formed over the centuries, he came across a place called the Last Redoubt.\n\nHe was accepted by the people, proving himself an effective and fearless general (despite his non-violent outbursts), especially when leading the charge with his trusty trenchgun, and would eventually become very familiar with the members of the Nurses Union, becoming fast friends with many of the practitioners, aside from the chemist who developed the medication to help tame his delusions."

  ##Ideas
  tlr_fortified_position:0 "Behind The Walls"
  tlr_fortified_position_desc:0 "Founded by the construction crew of the half finished Vault 55, left behind by company and country, the Redoubt has survived all these years within what was once Nebraska by using their skills to fortify their settlements, and standing firm atop their walls."
  tlr_union_charter:0 "Council Of Post-Nuclear Trade Labor"
  tlr_union_charter_desc:0 "Often referred to as simply "the Union" by those living in the Plaguelands, the CPNTL is the primary leadership in Redoubt territory. Union members are able to vote directly on their leadership and changes to the Bylaws of the Contract; in turn they have a responsiblity to pass down the skills of their respective trades to new generations.\n\nWhile membership isn't mandatory, in practice most natives eventually join and apprentice in one of the Nine Trades: the Carpenters, the Masons, the Ironworkers, the Plumbers, the Machinists, the Electricians, the Nurses, the Laborers, the Farmhands, and the Teamsters."
  tlr_tenth_trade:0 "The Eleventh Trade"
  tlr_tenth_trade_desc:0 "Historically, the Redoubt has never had a formal army as such. Their defense lies mostly with settlement militia groups, hunters, armed caravan guards, and outsiders (from both inside and out the Wall) who have banded together as mercenaries. Locals occasionally gather into dedicated fighting units, usually those with a particular talent for fighting (or no talent for much else), but these formations rarely gain much acclaim or funding. All together soldiering is sometimes derogatorily called "the Eleventh Trade".\n\n The times are changing however, and as ever more threats circle the Redoubt's battlements, more voices are calling for a full time warriors that can defend the Union."

It could take a life time to succeed at such an endevor with our resources and knowledge, however, so for now we merely repair and reprogram damaged robots and send them into battle."

  nf_tlr.1.d:0 "While technically any member of the Redoubt can be placed on the ballot for Supervisor so long as other members nominate them, in practice the main contenders every year tend to be current Foremen (who are allowed to keep that post alongside the Supervisor position). In keeping with that, three Foremen have thrown their hats into the ring this year.\n\nEthan O'Neil was almost a given: having led the Union for two terms already, and not yet old enough to hang up his hardhat. A stanch proponent of the CPNTL's values, if reelected he has promised to double down on defending ourselves the way we always have: stone walls, strong hearts.\n\nAnnabella Cross has been a well known member of the Redoubt for many years, but only took over for the Ironworkers two years ago in an emergency election. A peacemaker and diplomat, she openly calls for opening dialogue with those beyond our borders.\n\nLast, young and ambitious Leo Maldonado, Electrician Foreman. Having risen to the position only last election, he's already made waves for radical proposals: utilizing machines for aggressive action, putting our limited supply of robots into the field to save Union lives.\n\nWhoever wins the election this year, we're certain to see drastic changes: the Plaguelands is facing trouble like nothing since the Qurantine began!"

The letter detailed an offer of friendship, of alliance, of standing together against the dangers of the Plaguelands. Provisions were included for the tolerance of the faith of the Divine Flaw, and promises of protection for missionaries. It would tie our two communities together for better or worse, but perhaps it would be good to have some friends in this dangerous world."

They would be friends and allies to the Redoubt, and stand together in the coming times of trouble.

  nf_tlr.6.d:0 "Annabella hadn’t been certain whether the folks in the Fringe could even come up with a united response to her offer. That was just what she found herself sitting at her desk and reading however. It was crude but they’d agreed to be friends and allies.

While we can't quite understand all the nuances of these machines, they don't appear to be hostile to us. Sending an envoy, we may manage to come to terms with them, and support each other."
  TLR_annabellas_fringe_invitation:0 "Reaching Out To The Workers Of The Fringe"
  TLR_annabellas_fringe_invitation_desc:0 "The Fringe is an anarchic place, many divided hands working only loosely with each other on common goals. Many of them, however, may be willing to cut deals with us, trading labor and supplies with each other."
  TLR_annabellas_funds_for_mercs:0 "Hiring Additional Mercenaries"
  TLR_annabellas_funds_for_mercs_desc:0 "While mercenary bands have often been utilized by the Redoubt in the past, our current situation sees us critically undermanned. By sending out offers of caps and vaccines beyond the wall, we may be able to draw in additional guns for hire willing to work for us."
  TLR_annabellas_outwall_outreach:0 "Seeking Ties Beyond The Wall"
  TLR_annabellas_outwall_outreach_desc:0 "While we're now fair secure in our position, the fact is the Plaguelands have been isolated from the rest of the world for far too long. While we must certainly take precautions against spreading the Plagues outside the Qurantine, we believe we can still find ways to make steady contact with other factions!"

  TLR_leos_agenda_category:0 "Leo Maldonado's Agenda"
  TLR_leos_agenda_category_desc:0 "Leo's agenda is bold, striving to find ways to handle the threats against us before they can even reach our walls. Time will tell if he's as knowledgable on robotics as he believes himself to be."
  TLR_leos_wargoal:0 "Hacking The Parish"
  TLR_leos_wargoal_desc:0 "While the Parish in and of itself poses little threat, their robots could be put to better use without all this Flaw nonsense, and will be an excellent proving group for our ideas as we push towards newly awakened machines from beneath the earth."
  TLR_leos_second_wargoal:0 "Secure The Depot Facilities"
  TLR_leos_second_wargoal_desc:0 "Recently revealed, the rapidly expanding machine army appears to have originated from underground facilities in northern Nebraska. Besides putting an end to the threat, taking control of the treasures beneath the earth is a worthy goal for our future."
  TLR_leos_third_wargoal:0 "A Power Source For Our Ambitions"
  TLR_leos_third_wargoal_desc:0 "While we now possess a great deal more equipment and technology, powering it all on our limited fusion sources has been a challenge. The Oahe Dam, roughly maintained since the Great War by the raiding Busters, would provide more than enough for our goals."
  TLR_wallkeeper_initiative:0 "Project WALLKEEPER"
  TLR_wallkeeper_initiative_desc:0 "Broken chassis from the machine army we've defeated in the north have been brought back to Leo's workshop. Upon disassembly, his hunch has been proven correct: these robots were intended to be used as part of the Cordon Sanitaire, another piece of the automated defenses intended to prevent anyone from entering or leaving the Plaguelands.\n\n By reprogramming and reconstructing the robots and their facilities, they could be used to protect the Wall once more, keeping hostile forces from entering. They could even be directed to destroy other groups within the Plaguelands, if we so choose. With approval from the Council of Foremen, Leo has secured funding for this purpose: Project WALLKEEPER, to keep the Union safe, now and forever."
  TLR_form_rebuilders:0 "Rebuilding Tomorrow"
  TLR_form_rebuilders_desc:0 "Now, with the whole of the Plaguelands under our control, we're free to begin our vision of designing a new tomorrow in earnest. With the knowledge we've passed down for generations combined with what we've learned in our expansion, here in our sanctuary, the Union can rebuild what was lost with the lessons of the wastelands."
