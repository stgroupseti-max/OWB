  res_slaves_rad_protection:0 "Protection for the Slaves"
  res_slaves_rad_protection_desc:0 "Short are the lifespans of our slaves, even shorter the time they can benefit us through their labour. While we can not prevent their eventual death through radiation we can at least delay it by providing them with some protection."

  resg_friends_of_drussus:0 "Friends on The Other Side"
  resg_friends_of_drussus_desc:0 "Drussus may walk his own path, but it's good to keep in touch with fellow ghouls, especially ones that are high ranking Legion officiers!"

  resg_limited_expansion:0 "Carefully Extending Sub-Level 2"
  resg_limited_expansion_desc:0 "With trade and diplomacy going on above, we no longer need to maintain the relentless conditions of Sub-Level 2. Increasing production is still valuable, but not at the cost of other opportunities."

  resg_stand_against_bull:0 "The Foolish Bull"
  resg_stand_against_bull_desc:0 "Caesar apes a society that fell two millennium ago, acting as though they can be a blueprint in a nuclear wasteland.

  resg_close_mines:0 "Into The Sunlight"
  resg_close_mines_desc:0 "Some of the slaves haven't been allowed out of the mines in so long, the sun will surely burn fiercly in their eyes and upon their skin."

  resg_convince_born:0 "Arguments With The First Born Children"
  resg_convince_born_desc:0 "Despite the horrific experiments needed to bring them into being, the Born Ghouls are regarded with no small amount of awe. Getting them to accept Green's leadership would go a long way to keeping the peace here at the facility."

  resg_grant_freedoms:0 "Breaking The Collars"
  resg_grant_freedoms_desc:0 "No more will humans be forced to labor, collars around their necks. There will be misgivings, and we can not prevent those who prefer to flee. But in time a healthy smoothskin population will take root in our culture."

  resg_old_world_knowledge:0 "New World, Same Science"
  resg_old_world_knowledge_desc:0 "Nuclear war, not matter how devastating, does not change the fundamental laws upon which the universe operates. What worked before will work again."

  resg_boulder:0 "Open The Dome"
  resg_boulder_desc:0 "Boulder Dome was truly a marvel in its day, a great center of learning built to last through the end of the world and then some. Clearly, it was not a fruitless effort. Teams of scientists are already being dispatched to recover the research stored there."
