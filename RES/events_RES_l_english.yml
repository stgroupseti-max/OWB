  nf_events_res.1.d:0 "The Reservation was a top secret military and nuclear research facility, hidden away in the vast Arizona deserts. Led by the talented chief scientist Dr. Willem Clark, one of the greatest nuclear physicists America had to offer. Even back then fellow scientists were in awe of his undeniable genius, however perhaps even more important was his ability to bring out the best in the men and women under his charge, leading to many great discoveries, although ultimately none would have an impact on the Great War itself. When the bombs scorched the earth Dr Clark proved himself as a natural leader of men, while others panicked he stood tall as a symbol of confidence and order for the others to rally behind. It was thanks to his iron will that a select few managed to make it through, even if drastic measures had to be taken. Colonel Green and Dr. Clark had to make tough decisions to ensure the groups survival, they had to cull all non essential personnel. For this they had to..."

There was hesitation, perhaps there was a feeling amongst the freshly transformed ghouls that more than just a physical change their time underground might have cost them a part of their humanity as well and by stepping outside they risk losing whatever bits and pieces of their old selves they still clinched too. Again it was the Doctor who took action, filling their empty husks with a new purpose, a new reason to continue on. First he lined them all up selecting about half of their pitiful number, 12 for he himself intended to lead his own expedition into the newly created wasteland.\nIn the first weeks Colonel Green struggled to keep order, many wanted to follow Dr. Clark, to see the new world with their own eyes, as the weeks turned into months the excitement died down, instead tales and rumours about the horrible fate each expedition might have met spread amongst the camp. It was after 1 year without a sign of life having ever reached the ramshack settlement that the single survivor had made its way back and Dr. Clark was not alone. With him were many ghouls, ostracised and shunned by their old communities, having suffered long under the smooth skins boot they were all too willing to follow the man that offered them salvation to their undying existence.

His experiences amongst the smooth skinned wastelanders however have left their marks on him, no longer the first amongst equals, he has since come to fully accept his role in the salvation of Ghoulkind.\nIn time Ghouls are going to inherit this promised earth and time might be the biggest advantage his people have over the lesser and often short lived creatures that roam the wasteland. An insane warlord might conquer Arizona under the mantle of a new Rome, but Clark and his followers will live to see his empire fall to ruin. Yet nature played Ghouls a cruel hand, despite giving us an unnatural long lifespan, it is still a far cry from true immortality and despite Dr Clarks success with the creation of new Ghouls, his people ultimately lack the ability to sustain themselves on their own and so smoothskins are ultimately still needed."

The specter of radiation had always kept some potential buyers at bay and their prices low, but not any longer. With the claiming of Los Alamos after a hefty weapons shipment to the Legion, the ghouls now finally got into the possession of a trading post deserving of the name. For now a few smoothskins still held out in their ill gotten homes, but in time they too would be replaced with a deserving ghoul population, with the town itself becoming a physical manifestation of Clarks dream. Vibrant trading towns like this will form the foundation of the society he intends to build. Even if it already took us 200 years to get here and may it take 200 more, one day every ghoul will have a place to call home."

Originally they had marched mainly at night, but after one of the more able bodied men tripped in the darkness and broke his ankle the centurion determined that they would from now on only march during the day, right after putting the unfortunate individual out of his misery, little did the others realise at the time that he had just become the most lucky one out of all of them. On the third day the strange procession reached the heavily fortified walls of the Reservation, a structure built from stripped down pre-war contraptions, from simple vehicles to entire planes all bolted together to form a barrier just as much intended to keep potential threats out as it was to keep its residence trapped inside. The centurion stepped forward, shouting something to the armed ghouls manning the gun turrets on either side of the gate and after some rumblings the heavy metal wings slowly swung open. A terrifying sight greeted the new arrival as a ghoul the size of a super mutant stepped forth from the shadow of a nearby tent, with the sadistic expression that only a creative mind could interpret as a smile he crossed the small distance between him and the heavy environmental suit wearing legion commander, next to him even the otherwise so physically imposing Caius Drussus looked like a child standing before an adult. The two exchanged a few brief words, then the transaction was complete, a stash full of weapons and the lives of 30 men and women had been forfeit to the Reservation. While the Legionaries took off to claim their price the horrifying Ghoul turned towards the newcomers, his withering mouth widening to reveal a set of equally rotten teeth, forming words that would haunt them for their remaining days:"

While Newborn are assigned to the Project, each month they will process an amount of supplies and bring the Project closer to completion.\n\nOur current estimates indicate we could only reasonably achieve 25% of the Project at current: we would need to Focus on new accomplishments to allow further progress."

  nf_events_res.7.d:0 "Having lived since the time of untold horror that was the great war, the ghouls of the reservation perhaps more than any other resident of the wasteland understood the importance of hope. No hope meant that people would simply fall to the ground, even if their bodies could have continued, robbed of the will and the reason to continue their minds would give in and they would all meet their end in the underground shafts soon thereafter. Give them too much hope however and they may attempt to revolt, plan their escape or foolishly waste their strength struggling against their inevitable fate. No over time the ghouls had learned to give their slaves just enough hope, a clean drink, a healthy meal, a few encouraging words, always just enough to keep them going that little bit further. After all, why waste such trivial things on slaves if their fate was already sealed, why risk what was left of their petty existence only to meet a far worse fate in the Green Room and the untold horrors that awaited beyond its illuminated door. Better to work, to not stand out to live another day, a faint hope enough to carry them through the grueling day or nights for that far underground there was precious indication of it being either. It all formed an illusion so powerful that even those with enough clarity to see through it choose to believe in it anyway, for what other choice do they have?"

If they had truly changed anything to improve their slaves' situations was anyone's guess, she certainly didn’t feel any different, however perhaps that was the point, if she didn’t feel any different she at least didn’t feel any worse. Working underground for so long that she had lost track of time, at this point even the feeling of the sun on her burnt skin had faded first into memory than completely, the occasional flickering of the artificial lights were the only true way of measuring the passage of time down here. “Just one more day\" that's what she had told herself when she was still trying to keep track of her ghoul guards schedules, a weakness in their defence, back when she still harboured thoughts of escape. Now all she could focus on was the cold rock in front of her as she kept raising her arms for yet another swing. “Just one more day day\" at this point the words themselves rung hollow as day itself had lost its meaning, who could truly say how long she had been here, weeks, perhaps months? Her thoughts were interrupted by a loud thump as the worker next to her collapsed. Some time ago she would have turned towards him, tried to help him up, tried to cover for him before the guards, now she just focused on her work as the lifeless body was dragged away. She didn’t even know his name, there was no point in learning it after all, few managed to survive the harsh labour they endured for long and in time she would have forgotten their names as well. Gathering her strength she raised her hands for another swing, her mind driven by single minded determination:"

Realising that he was being ignored the slave carefully raised his voice. \n\n“Master Hank, please!\" \n\nThe desperation with which he spoke was immediately apparent, and though he had tried to remain respectful, the tension of an hour spent in complete silence became difficult for him to bear. In his mind Hank silently thanked him for allowing him to mourn for as long as he did, but physically he remained motionless, despite being fully aware of the horrific ramifications for both of them should they get caught. \n\n\"You may go Peter,\" Hank said, his otherwise so cheery voice betraying no emotion. In the corner of his eye he could see relief in the young man's expression, but it changed just as quickly. \n\n“Not without you,\" he declared in weak protest, and Hank once again couldn’t help but admire the bravery of the young man. While Hank had certainly risked a lot to be here, be it death or perhaps even exile should anyone uncover the burial, a young human slave could expect an infinitely worse fate in the Green Room. It was one thing to risk one's own life foolishly for grief over lost, forbidden love, but another to put ones being on the line to aid a friend by illegally burying a human body, instead of committing it to recycling so it could serve the Reservation as fertilizer. \n\n“I loved her, you know?\" Hand said sombrely. "She never felt the same way, I could tell, but it didn’t matter to me, just having her around me was enough.\" Finally, the ghoul stepped away from the unmarked grave, and the two men slowly made their way back towards the cold unmoving walls that surrounded the Reservation. Peter could see tears forming in the eyes of the old ghoul as Hank continued. “I thought I saved her from this place when I let her go to travel with the prisoner. I thought I would never see her again, and now I wish I hadn’t... Why did the legion have to capture her?\" Hank broke off and for a time the two again walked in silence, only as they waited for the large metal gate to open did the Ghoul continue his voice barely a whisper:"

In the end it was Green that personally saw her through to the elevator after reprimanding the new recruit harshly, but when inquiring the reason for her long absence she refused to give him a committal answer, instead insisting that her findings were only intended for the ears of Dr. Clark himself."

He would have quietly faded into the background as younger more promising ghouls were born, were it not for his astounding resilience and work ethic. Always the first at work and the last to quit, he quickly endeared himself to the workers and it was for this reason Clark chose him over any other to lead the new Reservation expansion at Los Alamos, a task he accomplished just as skillfully as he crafts his weapons. With this important step complete he has returned to the Reservation no doubt to once again aid in making Dr. Clarks plan reach fruition."

Unlike us they can not count on the protection of the legion however and as a result found themselves conquered by what appears to be a remnant of Attis Army. Fearing mistreatment at the giant green hands of super mutants, many of them have since travelled across legion roads in search of a new home. The Ghouls of the Reservation welcome their kin with open arms and while the arrival of so many Newuns would usually spell trouble these Ghouls are remarkable well adjusted for life underground, not to mention that some have even begun to revere Dr Clark and his Ghoul children with almost godlike reverence, believing him to be the reincarnation of their long dead prophet."

Dr. Clark was insane, his mad scheme if it by some cursed miracle came to fruition, would likely result in nothing less than the end of what little life managed to escape the nuclear fire. No he had to be stopped of that there was no doubt, even if it came at the cost of his own life or what they had so painfully rebuilt. However over the long decades Green had gotten to know himself far more than any man could ever wish to and so he knew better. Stopping Clark was important, but the decision to get rid of him Green had made a long time ago. Before the doctors return it was Green who let the Reservation survivors and part of him wondered if he should have just shot bullet into Clarks head when he returned, before he could rally people behind his cult of personality, before he started secluding himself to lowest level and his insane experiments, but he didn’t. Having missed his chance then, Green had since spent countless sleepless nights planning, even so it was a gamble, with far worse odds than he was comfortable with. But at last all the pieces were aligned, this time he was gonna make that shot, it didn’t matter who would come out on top, either way tonight the nightmare would at last come to an end."

Green had expected a small army of fanatical scientists coming to Clarks defense, putting up a fierce resistance to protect their prophet, instead only a single one had dared to stand in their way and the quick bud of a rifle was enough to deal with him. Instead of panicked screams all that accompanied their advance was silent shock, expressions of disbelief as none even dared to move a muscle even as they planted charges on the sealed access point to the Green Room. To his credit Clark did not try to run or hide, not that either of which would have been possible, instead he stood there as confident as ever, perhaps expecting that the ghouls would stand down when confronted with their living savior and perhaps they would have, however before the bastard could open his mouth again Green pulled the trigger. Clark did not make a sound, perhaps his equal parts brilliant and deranged mind could not fathom that he had been shot, that this is how his dream would end. \n\nWithout a doctor taking charge turned out surprisingly easy, even his most fanatical followers quickly fell in line once they realized their cause was lost and when dawn came it rose above a new Reservation.

Despite his relatively bloodless coup Green had always known that some people would have to be dealt with, that some would never accept his version of events, blame him for taking away what could have been ghoul kinds salvation, and he could hardly blame them. He could scarcely believe it himself. \n\nRegardless, the sentence for dissenters was clear, ever since Green had taken to easing the mistreatment of the humans kept at the Reservation harsher methods of punishment had become necessary. He had never understood why the Doctor insisted on this needlessly cruel form of execution, until now, instead of simply putting a bullet in the offendents head, the long walk represented a far greater punishment, far beyond the realms of physical and mental pain."

Hank had done precious little to deserve either, the coup practically happened over night and he slept through most of it, when he awoke he found himself in a different and as he hoped kinder reservation.\n\n None the less, the fact Green hadn’t included him in the plan was probably for the better. For one, the late doctor had always placed a suspicious eye on Hank, and for the other he simply wasn’t soldier material. That didn’t stop Green from calling Hank into his office just a few days after the takeover, though, to announce his intentions of promoting him to be his new guard. \n\nHank, of course, objected, protested even, all while Green simply sat there and listened to the long list of reasons why Hank shouldn’t, couldn’t, wouldn’t be a soldier with attentive patience. Only for green to look him straight in his lidless eyes and announce without any force or irritation in his tone, “you will start tomorrow, you will find the uniform and everything else you need at the armory.” \n\nJust like that Hank had been brought into Green's new army, and despite his initial protest he took to the role surprisingly well, although he still struggled to admit this to himself. In fact, he found that his new position allowed him to improve the lives of his fellow ghouls and even the smoothskins on occasion, and so he took to his new role with the same passion as his old one. He got so busy that he only really noticed all the time that had passed on the day Green once again called him into his office.
