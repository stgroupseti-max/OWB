  RES_WILLEM_CLARK_DESC: ""§GBehold, children of Clark, for he is the one who guides you to the Promised Earth, where we shall reign as lords and saviours, and the smoothskins shall bow before us.§!"\n\nDr. Willem Clark was a gifted nuclear physicist at Los Alamos before the Great War, and as the chief scientist in the nuclear research and development department on Sub-Level 3, he commanded a loyal following of fellow scientists. Alongside Dr. Sebastian East, the two men served as would-be pioneers in many experimental fields of nuclear science. Where Big Mountain focused on making the impossible into real possibilities, and the Commonwealth Institute of Technology sought to redefine what it meant to be human, Los Alamos instead worked on refining pre-existing technologies. From the MANIAC supercomputer, planned to one day rival a ZAX, to the enhancement of the Minutemen XI nuclear missile, all these and more could have their origins traced back to this one place.\n\nWhen the bombs fell, Clark took charge and kept the survivors alive with hope that they would return to the surface and start life anew. When the survivors finally emerged, they were little more than two dozen ghouls. Clark set out to find other survivors. After a year of searching, Dr. Clark returned to the Reservation with two, possibly three dozen ghouls in tow, declaring that becoming a ghoul was an evolutionary process that would allow them to prosper in the scorched, radioactive Earth. He became their lord and saviour, guiding them into the next age of man: An age of ghouls. \n\nOver the next two centuries, Dr. Clark brought ghouls from all over the wastes to the Reservation and built an empire. His ghouls worshipped him as a deity, and he thought of himself as one. He became reclusive over the last fifty or so years, only communicating with his followers through computer screens and referring to himself in the third person. He continued to lead his people to the Promised Earth until his dying day, but no one knows when that will be, if ever."
