A life of hunting as nomads, of farming in the hills, and war with our neighbors. Others may have thought our life simple and quaint, but we thrived, and our spirits were true. The other peoples of the plains and mountains feared our might and unity, and made treaties with us to secure the peace. \n\nBut nothing lasts forever, and in time, "Civilization" would come to push us from our ancestral homelands.""

Our ancestors did not know what they signed away, and were soon forced back to reservations, to live in squalor and obscurity. \n\nBut the reservations did bring one saving grace. \n\nSo far away and irrelevant were we deemed, that China, the land across the big water of the west, did not deign to bomb us.

I stood against them, and I fought... many died in the struggle. It was not glorious, and perhaps we retaliated too hard, but I did my duty to my people, and we survived.

But something like this he could not ignore any longer.\n\n"They said it was like a trial. Those brave enough to drink it became sick and fell into a deep sleep. When they awoke, one of two things happened. Those who had passed, felt their minds expanded. They master languages in days, and even before they learn an outlander's language they can understand what they're saying, just by "Feeling the Intention". In turn the outlanders undestood their words, despite never learning our language. But most surprising of all is that it seemded to extend even to animals.

No matter how hard we try we have been unable to teach them any of this again. Only those who passed, the "Speakers", can understand them anymore. One was so distraught he tried to drink the water again. He did not wake again."\n\nOldgun marveled at the cave before him but held his breath. Was this some lost Manifest experiment? Some bizzare creation of FEV or radiation? Or was this water really a gift from Napi? He did not know, but he knew something must be done.

While some of these traditions won't work as well in the mountains, the lessons of self sufficiency may find use in the wasteland."\n\n"Perhaps one of the strangest of these lessons, to outsiders is our return to the use of bows. The arrival of guns once threatened our dominance of the region and it may seem strange to return to such a "primitive" weapon, but bullets are a limited resource in the mountains, and the few fools who've summoned a horde of ferals by letting the crack of a gunshot echo between the mountains and lived to tell the tale have some choice words on the matter.

In the lands of the Great Stampede, horses still roamed and to prove his worth to be a true War Chief, he would steal a herd.

Some claimed they had awakened the ability to speak with the spirit world, and many would flock to the role of medicince men. \n\nOldgun couldn't help but wonder what the future would hold. Would everyone someday be a speaker? What if they formed a guarded caste and tried to protect their power? Under Oldgun's watch there would be no such tyranny, but he couldn't help but wonder what the future might hold for his people. One thing was certain, for better or worse the age of the Speakers had come."

  nf_nit.16.d:0 "Morning Stag had always held out hope, but even he could not imagine the true extent. The death of the bison had been greatly exaggerated after all, and from Anvil to Whitehorse, the herds still wandered the wastes, with the population in the park especially surviving relatively free of mutation. Now, after a hours of agonizing negotiation, he was finally leading a herd a thousand strong was being marched through the mountains, heading back to the Niitsitapi homelands, where they could repopulate and spread accross the prairies. But the centuries of absence had left the people uncertain of what to actually do with them now that they were back, and as always it fell to Oldgun to provide guidance on the matter."

  nf_nit.17.d:0 "Fearing the danger of Macarthur's aggression, the Niitsitapi have sent envoys offering us a mutual defense pact. They do stipulate that if the worst comes to pass, they would like control of some of their tribal lands back. With a strong history of cooperation with their leader, the legendary Adventurer "Old Gun", the Rangers were more than happy to agree, but the final call lies on Sea Bastion."

  nf_nit.18.t:0 ""The Great Peace Of The Niitsitapi""
  nf_nit.18.d:0 "With the Americans finally pushed out forever, the Niitsitapi found themselves finally returning to a sense of peace. The Speakers help had made the Niitsitapi a hub of discussions and trade in the region. With Montana secured, it seemed the conflicts of the region where dying out, and any future wars would come from beyond. Oldgun rested easy, knowing that the future of his people was finally secure. He sent out a summons for Morning Stag at once.\n"It is good to see you, Naa. You needed me for something?"\n"Yes. It is time, Morning Stag. I know it is merely a formality, but I am announcing my retirement tomorrow. I think I'll become a storyteller, for the little ones."\nhe lit his pipe as his grandson approached\n"Are you sure? You still have some good years in you and the people need consistency. You've always been able to keep the nations working together, and I... am not certain I am ready to lead in a time of peace. I..."\nHe Hesitated\n"I'm don't believe I will ever be able to take your place. How could I live up to the legacy of the legendary Oldgun?"\nOldgun put a hand on Morning Stag's shoulder and led him to the window of the winter lodge, gesturing out across the plains.\n"Morning Stag, look at what you have accomplished. You became a true War Chief, earning every merit yourself. It was you who helped bring back the Iniiksii, who returned our horses, who helped lead our people against the American attacks. We have had disagreements, and I still worry about your temper, but you have done nothing but impress me these past few years. You have proven yourself as a warrior, and built your own legend. And now, I believe you will prove yourself as a leader in peace. You are ready."\nMorning Stag had rarely shown affection, but he could not help but pull his grandfather close for a hug.\n"Thank you, Naa. I will do you proud.""

  nf_nit.19.t:0 "Niitsitapi Land Deal"
  nf_nit.19.d:0 "While the Niitsitapi are rightfully cautious about the exploitative nature of defining borders and "cutting up land" like in the old treaties that lead to the reservations, the matter of figuring out who administers where is as much an issue in the wasteland as it was then. To prevent any gaps in oversight, and ensure everyone has fair access to the former territories of Macarthur, a theoretical treaty has been drawn up. Under this treaty the southern territories, including Bozeman and Macarthur Airforce Base itself will be transferred to Yellowstone, along with Elk Bend to provide a buffer between the Niitsitapi and the "Overzealous missionaries" of Heaven's Gate, while all other northern territories will be returned to the Niitsitapi, including Mount Powell and its accompanying valley. Additionally, Yellowstone will cooperate with the Niitsitapi on re-introducing the Buffalo to environments outside of the Park. And sign a pact of mutual defense against all potential threats in the future. The EPA advise however that the Brotherhood of Steel will likely not be happy with any outcome that doesn't see Yellowstone under their control. We could instead offer the Niitsitapi all of Macarthur's land on the understanding that we do not wish to be involved in their affairs in Montana, ensuring our own safety but leaving them to face the Brotherhood on their own."

  nf_nit.20.t:0 ""The Waters On The Mountain""
  nf_nit.20.d:0 ""Water has always been a strange thing for the Niitsitapi. Vital to every living thing, we drink from rivers and water our fields, yet we are cautious to do any else. In ancient days our ancestors were reluctant to even step in boats, for fear of the dark spirits that dwelled under the surfcae. This superstition began to fade when we were pushed to the reservation, but re-emerged when the spirits of the rivers and lake where replaced with Mirelurks and Lakelurks."\n\n"But despite our reluctance to travel it, water is also sacred to us, and the rivers under our protection. One of our oldest stories speaks of how long ago, all mankind spoke the same language, until Napi, the Old Man, invited every people to Chief Mountain to drink many colors of water. When everyone was done, they were confused, speaking different languages. Only the Siksikaitsitapi, who had drank the black water, continued to speak the same language as before. At least, that is how the story goes."\n\nJeremy Paused his story for a moment to consider. He had always been skeptical about this story, but stories had been circulating that a clan had found the Black Waters in a cave to the north. Perhaps there was some truth to the story he had always questioned?"
