 nf_met.1.t:0 "Man From Slave"
 nf_met.1.d:0 "So, you want to know how Steel Joe came to lead, eh? Sure, pull up a chair, adjust your arm's servo-motor, and I'll tell you all about how the Metal Mouths came to be...\n\nY'see, 'bout a decade or two back before our story begins, the man who would become Steel Joe was nothing more than one of the pack slaves out in the Midwest. After his boss had gone to sleep, having stuffed and drugged himself silly, Joe decided to take a stand with the other slaves, and brutally killed their boss. Knowing they couldn't remain nearby, they packed up and headed north.\n\nThey picked up bored souls who wanted more excitement in their lives from Havre, miners from the Consortium who wanted fresh air and a fresh chance at life. Outcasts from across the Northwest joined their march. In the span of a few months, Joe had assembled a collective of raiders, settlers, and everything in-between. Not wanting to be like his former boss, Joe did everything to keep himself and his gang both physically and mentally fit. However, it was never enough for him.\n\nHis arms sprained, his legs broke, his eyes strained, even his jaw became near-useless to him after months of constant strain taking its toll on his body. The same happened with his men. In only a few raids, the men and women of the group became just as battered and worn as Joe, only staying with him because of his charismatic charm, ruthless leadership, and his commitment to persistence.\n\nBut even ol' Joe knew that he had pushed himself and his group too far. Despite their mental and physical training, all he had succeeded in doing was wearing out those he had recruited, far worse than they ever had been treated before. It was only with the realization that it wasn't his methods, it was the limitation of the human body itself, that Joe came to finding out a solution. And so, he decided to venture to a place he had read about that was located close by: the Magic City...."
 nf_met.1.a:0 "A place of Hope"
 nf_met.1.b:0 "A path of Glory"
 nf_met.1.c:0 "A true city of Magic"

 nf_met.2.t:0 "Like A Rabbit From A Hat"
 nf_met.2.d:0 "Magic City, like its name implied, truly was a magical sight. Before the Great War, although it was nowhere close to the accomplishments of the Commonwealth Institute of Technology or Big Mountain, Billings was reputed for developing its health care sector beyond much of the capability of America before the War. Although the developments were criticized as costly and inhumane by some, many others praised the city for being the step into the 22nd century that America needed in the wake of many military men and women coming home with mental scarring, physical injuries and many disabilities.\n\nJoe first explored the city with a small group, the least afflicted by the months of rigorous training they had undergone. Coming upon the city, they were met with faded glitz and glamour of a city that praised itself on automation, and specifically on the idea of human cybernetics. Posters promoting the benefits and uses of human augmentation scattered walls, with a Pre-War broadcast of a woman and man proclaiming how great their lives had been since replacing their limbs on loop. All the posters and broadcasts pointed towards one facility: Billings Health Center.\n\nUpon entering the building, Joe and his squad experienced a most magnificent sight. Test equipment, prototypes, actual functioning Auto-Docs, even a relatively sane Mr. Orderly, who was more than happy to have a visitor to the city in decades. Although the Orderly was concerned at the state of the group, they saw it as nothing more than a prime opportunity for the city government to showcase their newest developments.\n\nAnd so, Joe and the rest became cybernetically enhanced with some of the most top-of-the-line Pre-War cybernetics the world of 2077 had to offer. The Mr. Orderly, citing some Pre-War tax act or code, even proclaimed that, if they could bring their "friends", they would get a free discount on manufacturing the metal themselves, due to the Pre-War manufacturers no longer answering the Orderly's delivery requests.\n\nWith that single word "Metal", and one of his most prolific enhancements, the one to his jaw, Joe knew what he must become. What his entire gang must become. And so, the Metal Mouths were born."

 nf_met.3.t:0 "Metal Made Strong"
 nf_met.3.d:0 "After several days of countless conversions, the newly-proclaimed Metal Mouths began their reign of savagery across the region. Beginning with the quaint town of Broadview, the citizens were given a simple request. Submit, or die. Upon seeing the unusual and almost inhuman beings that were making such a threat, the town capitulated to their demands. However, not all towns were so lucky. The town of Park City, for instance, was completely wiped out by the Metal Mouths when their inhabitants refused to submit.\n\nThe complete and utter annihilation of Park City served to Joe as an opportunity to terrify the region into submission. Using pieces of scrap and useless metal that served no purpose, the corpses of those from Park City were repurposed into horrific effigies and totems that signified the approach of the Metal Mouths, as well as what would happen to those who did not submit to their will. While this only worked on isolated settlements as opposed to more organized groups, this enabled the Metal Mouths to grow bigger and more vicious than ever.\n\nWith the use of the Metal, Joe and the rest of the Mouths no longer needed to maintain peak physical condition through strenuous exercise, they could simply take apart their robotic replacement, be it a leg, arm, or organ, and have an Auto-Doc or the Mr. Orderly look at it. If it was going bad, a bit of Metal could be used to fix it. If it was growing weak, a simple diagnostic could return it to peak condition. Joe thought the Metal Mouths would rule the Montanan wastes. He even grew an idea that he could grow to rule the whole of the Old World Northern Commonwealth, considering the task as his final act that he wished to accomplish before he passed on, if he could even pass on at all anymore.\n\nImmortality, power, strength, all of these corrupted Joe's mind, as it did the rest of the gang. Enhanced by their cybernetics, their seemingly infinite supply of Metal, and their ruthless and vicious tactics, the Metal Mouths began to plan a raid, a raid that was sure to cement the beginning of their legacy forever..."
 nf_met.3.a:0 "Ready the Guns"
 nf_met.3.b:0 "Trust in Metal Plates"
 nf_met.3.c:0 "Get the Best Crews together"

 nf_met.4.t:0 "System Error"
 nf_met.4.d:0 "The Metal Mouths had, in their minds, achieved the pinnacle of human condition. The strongest bodies, the most intelligent minds. All they needed was a means to sustain themselves. Despite their cybernetic replacements, their settlements needed food, and those who had not yet replaced their internal organs with cybernetic enhancements also found themselves with a highly increased metabolism, preventing them from gaining weight, but also on the cusp of exhaustion if they didn't eat massive quantities of food at almost every waking moment.\n\nAnd so, on rumors of a treasure trove of caps, food, and potential new recruits in the town of Missoula, the Metal Mouths journeyed west, slaughtering the Storm Mongers and West Montanan natives they encountered along the way. However, upon reaching the town, while they were met with a glorious sight of ranches, wealth, and power, they were also met with an unfortunate sight. Due to the recent threats of conquest by the nearby Heaven's Gate, Colonel Santiago of the recently-established MacArthur Enclave Detachment had sent out approximately a full three dozen Enclave soldiers, all armored in APA Mk. II, to protect the town.\n\nUpon learning of these newfound insolents who seemingly also had access to a form of precious Metal, Joe grew ever greedier, and began the charge by leading a cybernetic punch towards the first soldier he saw... only to find his cyber-fist being coated in a green substance. A green substance that ate away at his metal. Red, green, and blue beams of light, now also emitting from the soldiers protecting the town, came quickly after, eating away, both literally and metaphorically, at Joe's Metal Mouths. Joe was lucky to only have his fist taken away. Much of the Metal Mouths found themselves without legs, arms, heads, and worse.\n\nThe worst and final blow came when a woman, whom Joe's cybernetics picked up on being called "Colonel", ordered a full pulse grenade barrage. Pain surged throughout Joe and every one of the Metal Mouths, with Joe using the last of his strength to order a full retreat. Upon a near-superhuman feat of reaching Magic City, Joe and the surviving Metal Mouths found themselves without friends, without an infinite supply of Metal, and worst of all, an enemy who had a supply of Metal, or something stronger. From that day on, Joe swore to get revenge on the town, and on the woman who had humiliated him. Nothing would stand in his way..."
 nf_met.4.a:0 "Perhaps Patience is valuable after all"
 nf_met.4.b:0 "Bury our dead and for now we Carry On"
 nf_met.4.c:0 "We'll have Vengeance before those bastards know it!"

 nf_met.5.t:0 "To The Extreme"
 nf_met.5.d:0 "Steel Joe sat upon his diagnostic chair, recovering from his final victory over the ones who had humiliated him. He had not had the pleasure of meeting the so-called "Colonel", but he had won, and that was all that mattered. Overlooking his cybernetics, having grown in number from the day he had first met it, was none other than the Mr. Orderly itself, whom had been affectionately renamed by the Metal Mouths as "Doc". Joe preferred to call him Ripper.\n\n"Another fine day of testing quality cybernetics, eh, customer?" The Orderly seamlessly cut and sheared through the metal of the cybernetics as easily as it did flesh and bone, applying sutures and Stimpak fluid to maintain health balance. The robot's supply of anesthetic ran out long ago, which helped Joe keep his resolve in ensuring only the toughest and strongest were fit for Metal Mouth servitude. \nSuddenly, Joe's arm just about came clean off, as the Mr. Orderly began whirring and buzzing, with alarms and sirens emerging from all across the medical center.\n\n"WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON, RIPPER?" Joe cried, the noise from the cavalcade of chaos sending his enhanced hearing into a frenzy.\nThe Orderly returned to its normal functions, with the alarms and sirens dying down. "My apologies, dear customer, but let me be the first to thank you and all your friends and affiliates in testing our Consumer Cybernetics program, proudly sponsored by *whirr-buzz*. We would like to thank you for all of your generous services and endeavors over the past 10 years by letting you access the Platinum Partner tier of our program."\nThe robot reached into a previously unseen compartment, exposed by what now appeared to be a celebration, albeit one held 200 years late.\n\n"This schematic will allow you to convert you and all your buddies into what critics at Hyperdyne Cybersystems are calling 'the end of war as we know it!' Introducing, the Cybernetic Warform, sponsored by the United States War Department, in association with Artificial Intelligence project #59234. Enjoy your prize! Now back to our regularly scheduled diagnostic."\n\nLike that, it was over. But Joe's mind was racing. Using his free hand to open the schematic, he scanned it with his cyber-eye, revealing a new world of possibilities..."
 nf_met.5.a:0 "This will do nicely. Very nicely."

 nf_met.6.t:0 "First Child Of Sydney Loke"
 nf_met.6.d:0 "Steel Joe had torn apart the armored warriors of the Midwest, walked through the Gauss fire of Bismark alive, enslaved the tribe of two moons. But as he and his posse walked into the large doors of the MANIFEST facility, the cheer and joy of battle began to fade. The rainbow of colors began to crack and fade, much like Joe's own air of confidence, as they descended further into the facility. Leroy and Tammy trailed behind him, followed by Iron Tooth, who had taken an unusual break from his usual lab shenanigans once he had heard of the group's taking of the facility. The wooden icon on his neck twisted and curled between his fingers, as the man with the iron tooth took in the sights of the complex.\n§d"Say Joe, me 'n Leeroy are tryin' to settle somethin'. Do you think his boomstick did most of the work in takin' out those 'marck guys, or were my gen-yew-wine strah-tah-gem the better part?"§!\nJoe held up his fist. §D"Far as I care, both of you are equal in how punchable you are. Anyone want a taste?"§!\n\nA fist that quickly sparked and sputtered. Along with the rest of Joe. To the posse, it seemed like no more than a usual temporary malfunction. To Joe, it was as though his entire being was being ripped apart. Quickly as the sensation had engulfed him, the sensation disappeared, as did the sounds of his posse behind him. Upon opening his eyes, he found he had been ripped apart, in a way.\n\nHe was nothing more than his previous flesh and blood body, somehow returned to him. In front of him, the Metal... HIS Metal, swarmed. Swarming in the shape of something that looked like an angry beast. But even in looking at it, Joe saw it wasn't the hungry kind of angry, it was a demand. An intelligent demand from an intelligent beast.\n\nOn the other hand, that was his Metal it was using, mocking him. All it would take is him remembering himself, his humanity, his sanity, everything he had gained when he first ventured to Montana on his own feet so long ago, to get it back."
 nf_met.6.a:0 "He knelt to the beast. After all, what was he if not a beast himself?"
 nf_met.6.b:0 "Regular Joe clutched his fist. He would be Steel Joe again."

 nf_met.7.t:0 "Squeezing Diamonds Out Of Coal"
 nf_met.7.d:0 "A messenger, or more accurately a thug, from the brutish Metal Mouth arrived this morning. Not to discuss our usual tribute arrangements but instead to make a specific demand. After much posturing they explained that their masters want diamonds, all the diamonds we have. They were unable to truly explain why other than to say it had something to do with the everpresent implants the gang sports. The smirking raider also made it very clear they intend to get the diamonds one way or another if we’re not willing to hand them over. We’ll need to carefully consider our answer."
 nf_met.7.a:0 "You Can’t Burn Diamonds Anyway"
 nf_met.7.b:0 "They’ll Have to Come and Take Them"

 nf_met.8.t:0 "The Expected Response"
 nf_met.8.d:0 "Word’s come back from those scrawny soot lickers in the Consortium. They said a bunch of fancy words but it all adds up to “take the diamonds please, don’t hurt us!” Which is about what we expected. They’d have to be stupid to want a scrap with us, even over something like this. Now just to put all these diamonds to use. Wonder how good they’d work as teeth?"
 nf_met.8.a:0 "Yeah, I wonder..."

 nf_met.9.t:0 "An Unexpected Response"
 nf_met.9.d:0 "Word’s come back from those scrawny soot lickers in the Consortium. They said a bunch of fancy words but it all adds up to “come and take the diamonds.” Wouldn’t have expected them to grow a spine now but it looks like they want to square up for a rumble. We need those damn diamonds and what Metal Mouth would back down after disrespect like this even if we didn’t? Let’s give them what they asked for and let’s go take them."
 nf_met.9.a:0 "They’ll Regret This"

 nf_met.10.t:0 "Metal Mouthed Merchants"
 nf_met.10.d:0 "And lo unto us came wolves in the skin of sheep with teeth of metal rather than bone. The lambskins of the merchant they wore, with thoughts of barter on their minds. From the east they came, sinners one and all but with a gift of god in their hands nonetheless. A wagon they brought, laden with the bones of broken planes claimed from far flung airfields. Angels must have guided them to our gates, and the steel faced messengers spoke of a great many more wagons of parts taken from the fields. Their hearts were yet hard though, like unto their steely skin, and they spoke of payment. A great tithe of caps they required, were they to deliver the rest of the parts."
 nf_met.10.a:0 "So be it"

 nf_met.11.t:0 "Party On Company Time"
 nf_met.11.d:0 "We didn’t really expect to make friends out here, at all really, but sometimes you get more than you bargained for. Steel Joe and his Metal Mouths are some hard bastards and we’ve agreed to a bit of mutual investment; watching each other's backs and splitting up turf. They’ll provide muscle and anything that’ll keep the story running and we’ll keep them stocked in guns and gizmos for their implants.\n\nWe had a huge blow out to celebrate, kinda trashed the store a bit actually. Worth it though, those metal boys and girls know how to party. We provided the booze and they brought the food and there wasn’t a bit left by the end. Good thing they knew how to cook too; they weren’t very impressed with the pizza party we redeemed for the occasion. It was a big success and a lot of friends and rivals were made that night. Knocking heads and cashing folks out with them should be a real blast."
 nf_met.11.a:0 "When’s the next one?"

 nf_met.12.t:0 "A Raider Rager"
 nf_met.12.d:0 "Making pals isn’t exactly our strong suit but those Miscount guys are alright. We can see eye to eye with them, and they’re just the right kind of violent sons of bitches you know what you’re getting out of. It wasn’t even that hard to decide on turf borders. They also have more guns than we can count and are willing to share. There’s worse pricks we could have watching our backs.\n\nThey threw a big bash to celebrate and we had a real gas, nearly set the big talking mall on fire. Real funny to watch the robots scramble about with extinguishers like crazy. Even Mercury smiled for once. It was a good thing we brought food to go with their booze though, cuz that pizza shit they had sucks. Still a night spent boozing, doing chems, brawling and getting laid is always a good time. We’ll have to do it again sometime, maybe after some tag team ass kicking."
 nf_met.12.a:0 "Seriously, that pizza was awful."

 nf_met.13.t:0 "Mayhem In Winifred"
 nf_met.13.d:0 "Out of the blue the Metal Mouths hit us hard last night. A crew of them led by some screaming nut who kept shouting about Mayhem swept in, killed anyone who put up a fuss and trashed everything in their path. Our own militia wasn’t as prepared as it should have been and barely put up a fight. The brutes ended up walking off with a stockpile of weapons, any caps they could find, and the old statue near the market to add insult to injury. Folks are hopping mad and already there’s outcry to hit the bastards back. This is an attack on Liberty after all!"
 nf_met.13.a:0 "Not the buffalo statue!"

 nf_met.14.t:0 "Mayhem In Lavina"
 nf_met.14.d:0 "By blessed Liberty we did it! The militia we raised has returned triumphant from the Metal Mouths territory. Our brave men and women came upon the camp of the very same warband who had attacked our homes and livelihoods, though their screaming leader was gone. Many of the raider scum were gunned down and the rest scattered before our glory. Much of our stolen goods were recovered to be returned to their rightful owners and even the buffalo statue was brought back home. For good measure and to make a point, we let off enough explosives in their camp to send it sky high."
 nf_met.14.a:0 "How about them fireworks?"

 nf_met.15.t:0 "Steel Smiles"
 nf_met.15.d:0 "It was the talk of the gang; Tiny Tin, the scrawniest bloke in the Metal Mouths, had swaggered in one day with his entire gob replaced with iron and steel. He put ‘em to use quick too, nipping off a few of Carl’s fingers when the fella got too close. Tin got a lot more respect after that and after a few beers he was feeling charitable enough to share where he’d gotten them with the rest of the gang. A doctor by the name of Unterbeit was blowing through the area and his specialty was teeth. Tin had asked the dentist if he could replace his whole set of choppers and the jaws holding ‘em with metal and after a shrug the doc got to work on him. Tin ended his story by asking the crowd “Can you really call yourself a Metal Mouth if you’re still working with a smile made of bones and skin?”\n\nThe next day a crowd and then a queue formed outside of Dr. Unterbeits camp as the Metal Mouths came out in force to live up to their namesakes. The doc was quite rich, if exhausted, by the end of the day and within a few weeks the Metal Mouths had mostly converted to literal mouths of metal. Joe shrugged it off as a fad started by a runt, not all too pleased as half his gangs pocket money wandered off down the road in the hands of a dentist. Still, the gang seemed happy and it was their money to waste."

 MET_end_of_the_khans_desc:0 "The Khans claim a long history, all the way back to the deserts of California. Almost a shame we gotta end their legacy of survival here, but them's the breaks. Only Metal lasts forever. Still, at least some of them are tough enough to run with us."

 MET_a_little_mayhem:0 "A Little Mayhem"
 MET_a_little_mayhem_desc:0 "General Mayhem got a little rowdy this week trying to impress his "pa" and led a small raid up into one of the towns allied with the Cult of Liberty. Normally you'd need Steel Joe's approval for that, but if the loot's good enough, maybe he can get praise for "showing initiative". Besides, what are they gonna do about it?"

 MET_the_cult_struck_back_desc:0 "Welp, didn't see this one coming. Havre used to be run by regular townsfolk, the kind that won't look for trouble after the occasional assault. Now that they believe in this "Liberty", they've obviously gotten a lot bolder.

 MET_a_late_shipment:0 "A Late Shipment"
 MET_a_late_shipment_desc:0 "The Coal Consortium is usually pretty timely with their payments. Heck, they know how we get when the caps are late. We've been doing our part lately to keep their caravans safe, and they owe us for it. Guess we'll have to go check in on them."

And yet today, we stand in total control of the lands of the Northern Commonwealth, united with our iron hands. Steel Joe's truths of endless improvement or death are vindicated as he stands atop the skulls of our enemies and the spoils of our tribute.\nOnly we, who choose strength above all else, at any cost, could have achieved this.\n\nSo fire up the auto-docs, and take another pound of flesh: the Metal Reigns!"
 MET_better_than_coal:0 "Better Than Coal"
 MET_better_than_coal_desc:0 "While a bunch of shiny rocks seemed like a ridiculous payment, Ol' Iron Tooth tells us this is actually pretty useful: they can help with the neu-neura- the Metal Connection in our implants. We'll have to see how many more the Consortium has been digging up."

 MET_diamonds_in_the_bag_or_else_desc:0 "Doc Ripper agrees with Iron Tooth: the diamonds would be great raw material for making the control circuits in new Metal or improving the old.

 MET_a_favorable_count:0 "A Favorable Count"
 MET_a_favorable_count_desc:0 "A talking Mall is a weird place to set up shop or take orders from, but who are we to judge? We've heard of the Miscount's exploits out west, and their recent change in luck makes them valuable but lacking in friends. Steel Joe is ready to shake hands and define hard borders between us in the north if they'll start supplying us guns, one raider gang to another. Plus, have you seen the membership plus package?"
 MET_a_strange_howling:0 "A Strange Howling"
 MET_a_strange_howling_desc:0 "As we approach the eastern end of, some of our guys have been reporting strange misfunctions in their implants.

 MET_man_and_machine_desc:0 "The Miscounts and us have very different ways of working with machines. You'd think it would be a point of contention, but we don't really care. We know our way is better. Means we trade for different parts too."
 MET_irontoothstale:0 "Iron Tooth's Tale"
 MET_irontoothstale_desc:0 "Ol' Iron Tooth knows what the visions mean, or so he says. When Joe demanded answers he started up some long tale about the wolf, and the mother creator, and MANIFEST, and honestly we all lost track. Then he mentioned the Wolf could control Metal like nothing else in the world, and we all perked up. Maybe we're on track to a new treasure, like what we found in Magic City?"

 MET_whynotwyoming:0 "Why Not Wyoming?"

 MET_the_southern_gogetters:0 "The Southern Go-Getters"
 MET_the_southern_gogetters_desc:0 "Some voices said we should turn down any invitations of alliance, especially to this Fire Council. Said we're strongest alone. Maybe there's some truth there. But Steel Joe sees further, and that's why he's in charge. The Metal isn't unlimited, and neither are our numbers. Stretch ourselves too thin, and all our recent gains can all come crashing down around us. A little mutual respect between warriors is all it takes to keep this alliance going."

 MET_billings_medical_marvels:0 "Magical Medical Marvels"
 MET_billings_medical_marvels_desc:0 "Billings' medical industry had become the highlight of the thriving city Pre-War, possibly the best in the Northern Commonwealth.

Risks be damned, soon it will be reality."
 MET_warform_1:0 "Mobile Hardpoints"
