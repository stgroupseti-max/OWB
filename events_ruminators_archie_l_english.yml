  nf_bth_archie.1.d:0 "Sister? Hope Ya Miss Her! \n\nDing-Ding-Ding! That's the morning bell, my brothers and sisters! And speaking of family— Brotherhood, amirite? A lofty word for over glorified crazy yahoos in steel and cracked up plasma. Hate them, tolerate them, there's no denying they're an interesting hot mess. Not only can they barely put folks like you and I under locks, but they can't even wrangle their own! \n\nA little birdy told me that their “Sisters” just got the boot after a failed coup! Isn't that sweet? But what happened to these Sisters, you ask? 'Pop!' Goes the heads of the persistent traitors, down to the ground the others stay, and those who did manage to escape lose themselves to the woods... Gear and everything, if you get my gist. \n\nWell, happy hunting, Saints!"

Not only can they barely put folks like you and I under locks, but they can't even wrangle their own! \n\nA little birdy told me that some “Sisters”, a rebel group within the Montana Brotherhood, just gave their boss the boot! Isn't that sweet? Waves of shunned Brotherhood now pour out of the region. But they're not like you and I. They don't know the land, and I hear this 'power armour' sells mighty fine on the market, if you catch my drift! \n\nWell, happy hunting, Saints!"

  nf_bth_archie.3.d:0 "Is it me?  Or are things getting a little... liberated? \n\nCheers to another one for you rascals out there.  To the boys working the homestead to the girls causing overdue mayhem!  But if you were to look up right now.  That's right, eyes to the sky, and then turn Northwest—chances are you'll see some reoccurring imagery.  I'm talking stripes, stars.  Red, blue, white.  Maybe even a green broad holding up a torch. \n\nCult of Liberty, they call themselves.  Just a big rave of people howling about Americana.  So, a babble of psychos!  Anyway, you guys know the drill.  I'm for all things observational.  But if a Sinner crosses the line, bop 'em!  Stay careful and crazy, Saints!"
