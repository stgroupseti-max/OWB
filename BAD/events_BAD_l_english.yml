  nf_bad.1.t:0 "Every Night on the Score"
  nf_bad.1.d:0 "Years ago, the Cab-Vultures rode far and wide across the Canadian Prairies in great big painted rigs. To the countryfolk of the CPF, their trucks came as thunder before the lightning, heard before they were seen. When they would arrive, they demanded two things: cash, and the opportunity to spread their word. \n\nThe various spray painted tags across the Canadian west are all attributed to one place: the families of the Cab-Vultures, obsessed with leaving behind symbols and messages for their kin to find later-- to some, making an entirely new generation of hieroglyphs. For years, their raiding gave them great stories and legends... Until the CPF shattered. \n\nThe most dastardly among them saw opportunity in the bleeding gut of the communists, and his name was Madvillain: the last great patriarch of the Greyhound family. With him being a man who never took off his helmet before his friends and family, many great myths were perpetuated about him... But what did the people say the most about him?"
  nf_bad.1.a:0 "His vigor was unmatched."
  nf_bad.1.b:0 "People would always follow him."
  nf_bad.1.c:0 "He was a master of the old songs."

  nf_bad.2.t:0 "A Whole String of Jobs Like We On Tour"
  nf_bad.2.d:0 "All over the CPF's lands, the Cab-Vultures rode as highwaymen, pillaging and plundering the wounded and splintering state. They fought from Byemoor all the way over to Kingsley, with a wickedly-well paced horde of trucks descending on wayward soldiers as they carved a path through the province. \n\nBut it was not to be.\n\nLockhearts—a family of another creed from Alberta—stood against them. Traps were set along the roads like spike strips and pressurized explosives, killing dozens of truckers in great wrecks that still litter the land. Before they could resituate, another challenge appeared from Saskatchewan. \n\nSundells—the tribesfolk were savage, and there was no sacrilege or destruction foreign to them. Some were even found feasting on the corpses of our brethren as ghouls, hissing as we tried to retrieve them. \n\nThese people destroyed us once, but so long as there is fuel in our engines, so too we must ride in the name of those who have fallen. It is in their names we crave triple digits, and in their memory we honor the threes and eights."
  nf_bad.2.a:0 "Rev up those engines, we've got a score to settle."

  nf_bad.3.t:0 "Bring Heat Like the Boy Done Gone to War"
  nf_bad.3.d:0 "Madvillain was no fool, and neither were the Greyhounds. As the Skiiers, Wolverines, and Kegwheels scattered into the wind with Kingsley's fall, the Greyhounds fled to Battleford, licking their wounds and taking small jobs and contracts to survive. It was in their dealings with Pierre Solomon in Stoon that they found some form of purchase, allowing them to get just enough to feed their children and keep their engines running. \n\nBut the money ran dry, and the Stampede took yet another bit of our lives from us.\n\nThis cannot be allowed to stand. The Cab-Vulture families will stand again."
  nf_bad.3.a:0 "It's about time."

  nf_bad.4.t:0 "The Fate of the Greystable"
  nf_bad.4.d:0 "Once, it was Kingsley, a beacon of vile merchantry and aristocratic madness. Then, it was Greystable, a monument to-- whether we want to admit it or not-- love, family, and belonging, something we understand very deeply. The Stampede took from us so much that we will never get back, but the memories forged in this place were carved from pain and made into home. Is it right, then, that we crave to destroy their culture, too? That we seek such vengeance? Or... Perhaps, is it time for the Cab-Vultures to find their own home, as well?"
  nf_bad.4.a:0 "A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime..."
  nf_bad.4.b:0 "We have found a new motorhome after all."

  nf_bad.5.t:0 "The Skiier Family"
  nf_bad.5.d:0 "The Skiiers are the youngest of the four motor-families, hailing from the Cascades. The Mountaineers in the passes ensured they had no home left in the mountains, and so we welcomed them as our own. They were quick to adopt our traditions and culture, though they carry with them a strange sort of "frat" energy about them that leaves most of the motor-families to dismiss their lower rank-and-file as drunkards and addicts. \n\nStill, they proved themselves more than capable surviving near Safehaven's unsteady borders for so long, and our headlights reflections on their goggles was just as good as any reunion could get."
  nf_bad.5.a:0 "From mountains to molehills. Or truck-tracks."

  nf_bad.6.t:0 "The Wolverine Family"
  nf_bad.6.d:0 "The Wolverines were always savages, exalted out of former Byemoor cannibals and bandits. The de-facto hunters and frontiersmen of the motor-families, providing much of the jerky and food needed to sustain us in days-gone-by. Their bear-trap gauntlets and knack for turning old trucks into war-machines made them a valuable friend in times past, and they're eager to get back to work now that they're in the fold once more."
  nf_bad.6.a:0 "Kings of the road? Oh, baby!"

  nf_bad.7.t:0 "The Kegwheel Family"
  nf_bad.7.d:0 "Everyone knows the Kegwheels. Their taste and ability to identify and create liquor is legendary from Calgary all the way to MANIFEST North, with some of the finest Moonshine west of Thunder Bay. While most are quick to dismiss them as fools and morons similar to the Skiiers, it is the Kegwheels who-- in their drunken stupor-- brought us much of the innovation and genius that we still employ to this day... And, of course, the money helped."
  nf_bad.7.a:0 "God bless the man I put this ice over!"

  nf_bad.8.t:0 "Her Name Is Joy"
  nf_bad.8.d:0 "When we scoured Greystable for the Couple, we found John Lockheart leading a charge that he did not return from. Amy-Lee Sundell, however, was another story-- one Madvillain kept to himself. \n\nWhen he entered their home, he found her with something he did not expect: a baby in the crib. On the verge of tears, she called him a monster. He agreed, but his hand was stayed. It would have been easy enough to kill her, but everything in his heart fought against it. \n\nIn her last moments, she chose to protect her one and only child. She did not raise a weapon to fight, or charge for glory as her husband did; she merely sat home and did her best to protect what she cared most for. \n\nIn that moment, Madvillain had a choice. He asked for the baby's name, and the mother replied simply. "Joy." \n\nHe stretched out his armored hand, watching as the baby held out its small hand, grabbing at his fingers."
  nf_bad.8.a:0 "They killed our children. We'll kill theirs, too."
  nf_bad.8.b:0 "Though Amy-Lee had to die, Joy would live."
  nf_bad.8.c:0 "Joy's family had already suffered enough."

  nf_bad.9.t:0 "Stared At Folks When Properly Provoked"
  nf_bad.9.d:0 "For the Cab Vultures, kinship is rare with those who were not born into the motor-families-- but in the First Nations, we found spirits with a fight in their heart much like our own. While our raids were more selfishly inclined, their desire for a home touched the hearts of the motor-family heads-- Madvillain's father especially. The Greyhounds found their fame and fortune through aiding an elderly Chief Burned Tongue of the Cree dismantle the CPF's supply lines leading into the Katch and Manitoba. The two spent the last years of Burned Tongue's life leading a great hunt against the CPF strategem, giving great cover to Burned Tongue's rebellion. \n\nOver time, the two became good friends-- sharing stories through writing and drawing before the passing of the old chief. Though Madvillain only knew him for a time, Burned Tongue's lessons and thoughts still lingered in his mind-- and his drawings remain pinned in his cabin."
  nf_bad.9.a:0 "Madvillain missed Burned Tongue like his own father."

  nf_bad.10.t:0 "Madfather"
  nf_bad.10.d:0 "Madvillain sat on a large stone, taking a moment to rest his bones and take in the horizon. This peace was short lived as Joy toddled by unsteadily, cooing as she made her way past and using his knee as a support. It had been a year since he’d taken her in as his own, and she’d been growing quickly. Quicker than he would have guessed but he wasn’t really sure what normal was. He’d set out some toys for her, little crude trucks and cars that had been assembled from scrap and parts of pre-war children's toys. They were her favorite things, and she wanted to play with them almost anytime they weren’t on the road.\n\nThe toddler made her way to the biggest one, that had been set up with a small horn that would feebly squeak under her slapping hands. Joy did this alot, and did now too as Madvillain looked on. After a dozen or so times she looked back at him and brightly burbled “beep beep!”\n\nHe stood then and scooped her up, smiling at her wild laughter before spinning her through the air. “That’s right Joy, that’s your beep beep.” His deep voice, normally used for intimidation, sounded almost soft now. The little toddler giggled as he set her down to return to her cars and he sat back on the stone, thinking of how small she’d been the first time he’d picked her up. "
