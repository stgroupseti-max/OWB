  bad_the_last_great_ride:0 "Legend of the Last Great Ride"
  bad_the_last_great_ride_desc:0 "Once, we rode across the Canadian Prairies unfettered... And then, practically overnight, we didn't. The Stampede has much to answer for."

  bad_they_called_him_walleye:0 "Madvillain's Quest"
  bad_they_called_him_walleye_desc:0 "For the last seven years or so, Madvillain has been doing his utmost best to provide for the motor-families that remain. It's only now that opportunity strikes, and the Stampede may be able to be broken in the same fashion they broke us."

  bad_rear_view_beauty:0 "Rear View Beauty"
  bad_rear_view_beauty_desc:0 "There is nothing truly like the view from your rear-view mirror... Especially when what you see is some poor fool on a horse who just can't seem to keep up."

  bad_tricking_our_rides_out:0 "Painting our Cabins"
  bad_tricking_our_rides_out_desc:0 "Whatever family you're from, one thing's for certain: we're all Vultures in the end, and Vultures need decorum. There is nothing more sad than a bare cabin for a Vulture."

  bad_legends_of_vaudeville:0 "The Old Songs"
  bad_legends_of_vaudeville_desc:0 "Before Madvillain's death, the Stampede destroyed so much of our culture-- all stored within the minds of our now lost Operators. Some say that the lost scriptures are kept in Greystable, near the very ashes of what once was Kingsley-- a gross monument to our death."

  bad_money_folder:0 "Money Folding"
  bad_money_folder_desc:0 "We've traded blood for money for decades in the hopes that we'd be able to find our own. \n\nThat isn't working. We need a new home, one we can share and grow in."

  bad_miscount_buddies:0 "Approaching Middlemark"
  bad_miscount_buddies_desc:0 "The Miscounts are another breed of raiders-without-a-home. Past relations with them have always been positive-- maybe it's time we find some kindred spirits."

  bad_loyal_customers:0 "New, Loyal Customers"
  bad_loyal_customers_desc:0 "With our newfound partnership with the Miscounts, Penny's been nicer and nicer to us-- offering us a premium membership package. Ain't that swell?"

  bad_electoral_buddies:0 "From Madvillainy to Mad Men"
  bad_electoral_buddies_desc:0 "The Electorate has always been a good source of income for us, and we've been good partners to them in turn. Whether it's Dundurn calling the shots now or Pierre, we ought to throw our hat in the ring and see if we can't make a new life that way. Madvillain in a suit'd be a hell of a thing to see."

  bad_dandelion_truckers:0 "Dandelion Truckers"
  bad_dandelion_truckers_desc:0 "While eating people isn't exactly something we've been accustomed to, we certainly aren't above it. Desperate times, right? Haha!"

  bad_jakobs_friends:0 "Friends with Benefits"
  bad_jakobs_friends_desc:0 "Jakob Dundurn has always been a good friend to the motor-families. His factories have given us many repairs pro-bono that we otherwise wouldn't have been able to do. We ought to really return that favor."

  bad_congressional_buddies:0 "The Métis"
  bad_congressional_buddies_desc:0 "The Métis have been spurned in many ways similar to ourselves. While their culture is far older and much more dignified than our own, we have much we could learn from them-- and with our vengeance settled, perhaps we could offer our own families to their noble causes."

  bad_metis_trade:0 "The North American Fur Trade"
  bad_metis_trade_desc:0 "The artisans of the Métis are famed for a variety of reasons. Ours have always been far more crude and simpleminded, focusing on weapons of war as opposed to tools of survival. Let us assist them in every way we can."

  bad_the_mobile_workshops:0 "Workshops On-The-Move"
  bad_the_mobile_workshops_desc:0 "Our workshops have always been safely tucked away within the trailers on our trucks. As such, they're easy to destroy in the event of an incursion-- and easier to hide, too."

  bad_vulture_culture:0 "Vulture Culture"
  bad_vulture_culture_desc:0 "The motor-families have always prioritized scavenging over anything else. We're survivors, nomads-- craftsmen only when we need to be. If you can't find it, maybe you shouldn't have it."

  bad_salvaging_loids:0 "Salvaging Loid's Graveyard"
  bad_salvaging_loids_desc:0 "The tanks of the CPF have been through much in the past two decades, leaving many as tattered shells both in the lands of the Stampede and the CPF remnants. We'll take what we can and see if we can't retrofit some into our own."

  bad_mobile_generators:0 "Mobile Generators"
  bad_mobile_generators_desc:0 "The mobility of our motor-families necessitates mobile generators. For years, our motor-shamans have mastered the art of electricity, even harnessing it in our trucks while they are on the move. Such is their magic, such is their wisdom."

  bad_scavenging_gains:0 "Bounty Scavenging"
  bad_scavenging_gains_desc:0 "There is plenty of old scrap from the old trucks that still litter the roads in the Stampede's lands. Let's take what we can and honor the fallen."

  bad_skiiers:0 "Listen to Skiiers"
  bad_skiiers_desc:0 "Kookie's always been true to her name: a real kookie bastard, for sure. She's always been fond of tricking our engines out for the simplest of tasks: raids that go fast and hard, the sort that'll make anyone who gets in our way believe in ghosts all over again."

  bad_wolverines:0 "Listen to Wolverines"
  bad_wolverines_desc:0 "Metal Fingers has always been a cruel motherfucker. He may seem like a savage who spent too much time around those cannibals in Byemoor, but he's always had a calculator for a brain, and he ain't shy about showing it. He likes it done quick as much as anyone, but he wants it done RIGHT more. Maybe if we had listened to him more we wouldn't be in this rut."

  bad_kegwheels:0 "Listen to Kegwheels"
  bad_kegwheels_desc:0 "The Kegwheels have always been a bunch of lightning-in-the-bottle type of geniuses; real, hillbilly type bastards who thrive off of balancing just enough moonshine to make them really keen to experiment. When they aren't drunk at the wheel, they know better than anyone how to make an engine REALLY sing. Like the old motor-shamans would say, "Zed may have been a crazy son of a bitch, but even he knew three X's on the 'shine was too much. Just one would do." \n\nNobody knew what they meant."

  bad_memories_of_the_last_great_hunt:0 "Memories Of The Last Great Hunt"
  bad_memories_of_the_last_great_hunt_desc:0 "Many years ago now, Madvillain fought alongside a friend. Those days are long behind us now; the road of life allows no U-turns."

  bad_the_stampede:0 "Vengeance, Completed"
  bad_the_stampede_desc:0 "Madvillain's revenge was sweet, but hollow. There was much to do, and much to mull over-- so much had happened that there was little time to truly ponder it. In the coming days, he would need to sit down and iron out the exact events."

  bad_gather_cultural_hallmarks:0 "Gather Cultural Hallmarks"
  bad_gather_cultural_hallmarks_desc:0 "Trophies from our culture are heralded as decorum in Greystable. They include dreamcatchers made of steel wool, weapons adorned with fuel stains and crude spray paint, and parts of our fallen truckers vehicles. Let us return what we can to their rightful motor-families."

  bad_fate_of_the_couple:0 "Fate of the Couple's Loyalists"
  bad_fate_of_the_couple_desc:0 "Madvillain's quest for vengeance was meant to be thorough, but it wasn't that simple. Nothing like death ever was. The fate of John Lockheart and Amy-Lee Sundell weren't that easy to sort. Those who fought for them were just doing what they thought was right, seeking vengeance same as he did. Was he right to kill them, truly?"

  bad_sundells:0 "The Sundells"
  bad_sundells_desc:0 "The Sundells were cannibals who tried to turn a new leaf, but they were still murderers all the same. They motor-family men like dogs, running them down from Biggar all the way to Lacadena. Their legacy would be that of blood, and of that earned."

  bad_lockhearts:0 "The Lockhearts"
  bad_lockhearts_desc:0 "The Lockhearts were frontiersmen, and they were as full of themselves as one could get. They chased down our trucks on horseback, leaving explosive charges under them and watching from afar with laughter as they watched our drivers explode unwittingly."

  bad_bring_them_to_task:0 "Moving On"
  bad_bring_them_to_task_desc:0 "We defined our quest on vengeance. The Stampede is gone. We must move forwards, and harness our rage into proper thought."

  bad_kingsley:0 "The City Thrice-Warred"
  bad_kingsley_desc:0 "Kingsley, Greystable-- whatever you want to call it, it's always been a place for sycophants and predators to flock. Some suppose that we just another breed, occupying the same land... They would be correct."

  bad_joy:0 "The Child"
  bad_joy_desc:0 "In that house, there was not just Amy-Lee. There wasn't John. There was another, and Madvillain was left with a choice."

  bad_gather_the_clans:0 "Gather the Lost"
  bad_gather_the_clans_desc:0 "Some of our motor-family kin chose to live in Greystable, seeking a home amongst their perceived conquerors. Given the chance, they would gladly return to our fold."

  bad_a_new_truck_lord:0 "The Trucking Lords, Reassembled"
  bad_a_new_truck_lord_desc:0 "With the four trucking lords back together, the motor-families are once again at their full might and then some. Without the CPF, without Kingsley, without the Stampede-- they are a force truly unstoppable."

  bad_greyhounds:0 "The Greyhounds"
  bad_greyhounds_desc:0 "Who was it who stood against the might of the CPF in times of old? Who was it who fought against the Canadian Peoples Front? The Greyhounds have long-since been vigilants of the Canadian Prairies, and they would gladly do it again."

  bad_greyhounds_wisdom:0 "The Wisdom of Madvillain"
  bad_greyhounds_wisdom_desc:0 "Madvillain's words were few, but they were powerful and valued when they were delivered. He was a man of action, and so his words were powerful. His wisdom called for a steady amount of internal production: supply lines of factories all contained within the trailers of our trucks."

  bad_kegwheels_leader:0 "The Keghweels"
  bad_kegwheels_leader_desc:0 "The Kegwheels and their liquor are famous for all the wrong and right reasons. Legend has it that if you drink enough beer, you go right back around to a double negative and become a genius-- and such philosophies douse the Kegwheel leadership with intelligence. It is from their deep gullets that we derive our innovation."

  bad_kegwheels_genius:0 "The Genius of Zed"
  bad_kegwheels_genius_desc:0 "Of all the motor-family heads, Zed was by far and the most relaxed. His intellect saved him from the Stampede's ire, ensuring his continued survival and return to the fold, where he now continues to work as our chief scientist."

  bad_wolverines_leader:0 "The Wolverines"
  bad_wolverines_leader_desc:0 "The Wolverines are savages that bring the reputation of the motor-families down, but they also serve as our greatest weapon against the foes who would try to do us dirty. They are the necessary evil to our survival, lest we go the way of the other Canadian tribals."

  bad_wolverines_strength:0 "The Rage of Metal Fingers"
  bad_wolverines_strength_desc:0 "Metal Fingers has always been a murdering psychopath. It was his loyalty that kept him to his fellow motor-families, in the end-- that undying respect for his peers and undeniable hatred for his enemies. Some say he eats people. We don't like to talk about that."

  bad_skiiers_leader:0 "The Skiiers"
  bad_skiiers_leader_desc:0 "The Skiiers were the only motor-family to not start as truckers, originating in the far west in the Cascadian Mountains. We welcomed them as kin, and they were eager to join. They may be a bit strange, but they have the right spirit, and that's what matters."

  bad_cascadian_passkeepers:0 "The Joy of Kookie"
  bad_cascadian_passkeepers_desc:0 "Kookie's madness was far from that of Metal Fingers, derived more from joy and a desire to cause as much mayhem as possible. Her joy binds us together in times of disarray. So long as her heart remains intact, so too shall we."

  bad_a_new_generation_of_truckers:0 "A New Generation of Truckers"
  bad_a_new_generation_of_truckers_desc:0 "From the fires of our exhausts, we have persevered against impossible odds. With our enemies gone, we may now raise a new generation of motor-family children without fear of death or comeuppance."

  bad_cold_beer:0 "One Beer Left"
  bad_cold_beer_desc:0 "With so much of our livelihood taken from us by the Great Stampede, we must endeavor to recover our lost resources. To do so, we must build a stable industry once again and also secure supplies for our trucks."

  bad_appeal_to_the_railway_union:0 "Appeal to the Railway Union"
  bad_appeal_to_the_railway_union_desc:0 "The people of Dundurn have been friends to our people for generations, and so too we have been loyal customers. The Dundurn family would happily supply us again, given the chance."

  bad_consult_safehaven_garage:0 "Consult Safehaven Garage"
  bad_consult_safehaven_garage_desc:0 "Safehaven may not be our friends, but the Wardens and the militants of Safehaven know quite a bit of know-how that can help us trick our stuff out. Perhaps visiting them would be worth it?"

  bad_thanks_dundurn:0 "With thanks to Jakob Dundurn"
  bad_thanks_dundurn_desc:0 "The Dundurn Estate providing us help deserves proper compensation in the old ways. Let us deliver them some supplies we believe to be of use!"

  bad_thanks_safehaven:0 "With thanks to Safehaven"
  bad_thanks_safehaven_desc:0 "Safehaven's garages have helped us restore ourselves to better conditions. Let us deliver them some supplies we believe to be of use!"

  bad_factories:0 "The Rage of the Machine"
  bad_factories_desc:0 "Our machines must be at their absolute peak. Let us resuscitate our workshops!"

  bad_research_slot:0 "The Way of the World"
  bad_research_slot_desc:0 "The way of the world is always changing and adapting. We must be ready to move with it, lest we be left behind in the ashes of the new age."

  bad_trading_afar:0 "Trading from Afar"
  bad_trading_afar_desc:0 "Though we may not use caps for internal trade, the outside world craves such knick-knacks. We must endeavor to gather a bunch."
