  BAD_walleye_name:0 "Madvillain"
  BAD_walleye_desc:0 "The so aptly named Madvillain-- the last true Greyhound, terror of Biggar, friend to Stoon, and murderer of the stampedefolk. Though some are quick to call him a force for good off of his history with Chief Burned Tongue, his actions have proven that he and his fellow Cab-Vultures that dared to remain are little more than crooks masquerading as Truck-riding Robin Hoods, out for blood as much as they are for money."

  BAD_kookie_name:0 "Kookie"
  BAD_kookie_desc:0 ""Queen of the Mountain," they called her. While her age is getting to her now, there's nothing that Kookie loves more than the rush of going as fast as humanly possible, be it down the road or down a slope. She's been the matriarch of the Skiier motor-family for decades now, and she isn't about to quit anytime soon."

  BAD_metal_fingers_name:0 "Metal Fingers"
  BAD_metal_fingers_desc:0 "Metal Fingers is thought of less as the patriarch of the Wolverines and more as the 'Monster of the Steppes,' a true beast of a man who cares only for wanton destruction and total domination. Though many of us crave family, he craves power, and while he remains a staunch ally of the other motor-families, all know good well to keep him at arms distance... Lest they go the way of his foes."

  BAD_zed_name:0 "Zed"
  BAD_zed_desc:0 "Zed may have the appearance of a total drunkard, but he's always been a reserved and sensible individual, carefully considering the counsel of his peers and foes alike. It's easy to figure out, then, how he ended up in the stewardship of the Stampede until the motor-families rejuvenation."
