  nf_jck.1.d:0 "Not far from Wyoming lays Missoula- a gem in the wastes once ruled by the 100 families, a powerful united familial force in an otherwise destroyed region, brought together by their need for peace and safety from the gangs of Montana; but before this, they were simply separate families of wastelanders in the area, those who had prepared for the coming of the end times, stockpiling food, water, materials, and knowledge for the dark times ahead. Suffering through the nuclear warheads, the resulting starvation, and the emergence of raiders and monsters, they got knocked down again and again, but they didn't forget the world that came before and chose to stand back up so that one day, they might reinstate something similar for the generations that followed them...  \n\nSome would’ve called them kooks, crazies, before the war, but after? They were survivalists, those who rolled with the punches and came out not always on top but alive to continue the tale. The Jacksons grew sick of cowering in the ruins of the once-beautiful Missoula, dealing with the raider gangs that staked it as its territory, and grabbing what they could before they got turned into food. They wanted more, so they united the families, leading them to become the §R100 Families§! striking down the costumed jerks and instating their rule as the de facto force in Missoula, Montana's richest and most powerful. \n\nIt was the bond the families formed not only between eachother, but within that allowed such strength to be formed. The attribute that led our ancestors to become so great and acknowledge this fact, uniting the families, was their? "

  nf_jck.2.t:0 "The Friends of Our Families"
  nf_jck.2.d:0 "Missoula, our home, beautiful and blossoming, wealthy and bustling, had grown into an economic center to rival the trade hubs of the old world, raking in enough caps to buy most raider's ignorance of our little unprotected jewel. This protection lasted a while, but not long enough, the raiders, dumb as ever, decided that destroying the only stable source of income would be better than preserving it, and we had to devise new plans to protect ourselves from the uniting raiders attacking the walls and wearing out our poor guards. While many of the families returned to cowering, the Jacksons saw the writing on the wall that the families didn’t have the necessary power, but luckily enough, they had the caps to procure protection, and even luckier, some forces that upheld the same safety that the old world Americans enjoyed remained not far from us, hungry for wealth...\n\nThe Wardens of The White mercenaries still upholding their duty, heard our call and were happy to receive some caps for taking out the trash. Working with them, we established our own democracy, one in which Missoula citizens could enjoy safety from the savages of the wasteland. With the help of Wardens, we had the power to fight off the weaker raiders, allowing us to give it less thought, even vacation some, and return peace to our home. The Wardens were spread too thinly to fully establish themselves in ourd lands, so while we still suffered from attacks of more uniform, professional forces, we put up more than enough resistance to make them think twice before messing with Missoula."

  nf_jck.3.t:0 "Last of Hundreds"
  nf_jck.3.d:0 "The Jacksons-- leaders of The One-Hundred Families-- defenders of old-world democracy... and now..? Hunters, exiles... survivalists... cast out by those we protected, those we bartered and fought on behalf of. Cowards, all of them, through and through- the Wessons, the Smiths, all of them-- bastards too scared of their own shadow to stand up for their founders- their... family. Let me finish this story, my family; after we set up their little vacation spots, their safe little walls, THEIR city. WELL, WE WILL MAKE IT OURS, OUR GODDAMN CI-\n\nI’m sorry, let me start over...\nMissoula, beautiful as she is, was nigh undefendable against any unified force, with the circumstances we faced, we knew this for years before the attacks from Heavens Gate came in 2268; still, we Jacksons took up arms, and held the lines against the lunatics, just like the stories of the old days pushing back raiders! Except these ones had tech’ out the ass, I’m talking serious firepower, so we sent out a big signal asking for help- and who answered?  §0The Enclave§!, remnants of the American elite- or something like that; either way, they saved us and established real protection against foreign forces. Everything seemed cheery at first, with the only caveat that the democracy we established years earlier was ripped away in favor of their military rule... So we did the American thing, organized a petition, asked for the return of elections- or their promises of it being established fulfilled earlier, and they slaughtered every one of us. The other families were too scared or maybe too domesticated to fight beside us. We ran to live another day and were forced to become what we are now to survive the harsh conditions... But we will return, and now that Wyoming is getting chaotic, we’re done rolling with the punches-- Let's utilize it to carve our path back to Missoula. \n\nTheres a lesson to be learned here, my kin..."

  nf_jck.4.d:0 "We did it, we did it my kin... Missoula... Ours– finally ours... \n\nIt’s about time we made it home, crushing these enclave fucks was the hard part– It’s time we begin rebuilding Montana, and rehabilitating our family. \n\nYes, rehabilitation– I’m afraid our little family may have a psychotic problem after all those cold nights out in Wyoming living like crazed raiders– even now I see it as I look upon my sons and daughters covered in deer guts and... human skulls. I feel even my own sanity slipping at times– as I am overcome with an insatiable bloodlust...\n\nWorry not though! Citizens of Missoula, your saviors are here, and with your help– as well as a psychiatrist– We will instate democracy soon enough! Just like the old world, before all these blood and guts– and stuff..."
