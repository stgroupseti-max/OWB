  HST_GOODWIN_NAME: "William Goodwin"
  HST_GOODWIN_DESC: "Some members of the Historical Society studied farming. Some learned how to skin animals. But Goodwin learned how to play the violin, a sound not heard in Dakota for over a hundred years. Goodwin's music is a comfort throughout the North, a reminder of why his people study the past. Not just to remember how to survive. But to remember how to live."
