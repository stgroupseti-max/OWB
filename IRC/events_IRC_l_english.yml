    nf_irc.1.t:0 "Chief Wuttunee v. The United States"
    nf_irc.1.d:0 "Over two hundred years ago, the United States began its hostile occupation of Canada. While a great amount of Canadian resistance petered out in the first few years, the First Nations did not relent so quickly. Many of the indigenous leaders rose up against the American invaders, all of them far from interested in having to renegotiate their already tenuous treaties with yet another unreasonable giant. \n\nAmong these was Chief Wuttunee, who ended up pursuing and trapping nearly the entirety of U.S. Army General Buford Wright's armored detachment located between Edmonton and Lac-la-Biche-- the same intended for use against the Canadian Indian population. While none of the soldiers were killed-- merely having their weapons and vehicles confiscated-- this move was turned against him, the government spinning it as the first in a long line of bloody conflicts throughout Alberta and Saskatchewan between various First Nations and the United States government. Even so, with the Great War raging worldwide, there were only so many resources able to be devoted to yet another aggressive campaign on Canadian soil-- enabling many more manuevers like this by other chiefs and Wuttunee himself. \n\nWhile Chief Wuttunee was eventually captured and executed for his deeds, the equipment from that detachment and others remains in our possession to this day, serving both as means of keeping ourselves protected and as a reminder of what he fought for. Of his exploits, what do we retain the most of?"

    nf_irc.2.t:0 "Even After Death, We Are Strangers In Our Own Land"
    nf_irc.2.d:0 "Even after the nuclear fallout had settled, the ensuing freedom from pre-war government did little to better the treatment of the Canadian Indian. The rise of the Canadian Peoples Front demanded conformity from the peoples of the north-- a conformity that the indigenous peoples had fought against for centuries. Even so, in the advent of nuclear war, the time for fighting had passed from many spirits for a time, leaving many weary and broken-bodied. Still, they were promised concessions-- concessions that never came. Yet another generation of false promises and lies given to the various chiefs. Yet another generation of broken dreams. \n\nEventually, the Canadian Peoples Front began to splinter, bringing ripe opportunities with it. Unfortunately, thanks to cruel politicking and selfish interests, none would be for the Canadian Indians. From these opportunities came many other groups, new oppressors-- the Kingdom of Manitoba, the Electorate, and so many others. While the Métis found a home under the 'watchful' eye of King Gunn, others absolutely did not crave a new-age British Empire, and so began a new war for independence."
    nf_irc.2.a:0 "The cycle continued."

    nf_irc.3.t:0 "Lost, Pursued by Empty Memories"
    nf_irc.3.d:0 "The attempts to find independence within the riches of Canada were rebuffed at every turn. When they weren't, the surviving Indians were lied to or used as pawns in others games. Eventually, they were driven to an impossible place-- a home where no one could bother them. \n\nThe Scarlet Blizzard was said to be a place beyond all life. In some ways, it was true, but the determination to live as themselves persevered even in the face of certain death. Even so, they bear the scars of two hundred years of having no home-- so many of their stories lost with the deaths of the elders on behalf of the CPF, Electorate, and Kingdom that their tribal identities have begun to fade despite their best efforts. Now, all that remains is the lone Confederacy, a ghost of what once was, pushed to the brink by selfish fools too busy scheming to give even an inch. Such is the life of the Canadian Indian. \n\nBut Howling Wolf did not accept that. She believed, despite the insistence of others and her own father, that they could still turn things around. They weren't doomed to live under crimson whiteouts for an eternity."
    nf_irc.3.a:0 "Howling Wolf often dreamed of reaching the moon."

    nf_irc.4.t:0 "They Called Them Faeries"
    nf_irc.4.d:0 "Maxwell Chase promised us a place where we could be free of the worries of the world. A place where we could live like our truest selves without anyone to stop us. At a time before Pleasantdale's resurgent population, we had no way of knowing precisely what he had meant. Had we known what the city would truly be, we would never have agreed. \n\nWe chose to live outside the city, to the north. It seemed a peaceful place, pristine, but we were fooled. Our children began coming down with an unexplainable illness the likes of which we had never seen. It wasn't long after that the mutant doctor-- the one from Wakaw-- visited us, learning of our plight. He too was horrified, and promised to take his research on it to Maxwell immediately. \n\nHe responded with the Faerie program. In the night, they came to take children from our homes and of the residents of Pleasantdale proper-- though it was undoubtedly weighted towards us. Now, nearly a third of a generation wanders that wretched city as its 'protectors.' \n\nBut Faeries remember, even if its nullified. We can bring them back home. It doesn't have to be this way."
    nf_irc.4.a:0 "We won't leave them behind again."

    nf_irc.5.t:0 "The Métis"
    nf_irc.5.d:0 "The Métis have been staunch friends of our many tribes for years. While they fell in with Manitoba years ago, in recent times they have found their own independence once again. Though they may have fallen on hard times, perhaps we can rekindle the old fires and begin trade missions once again?"
    nf_irc.5.a:0 "In times of hardness, it is good to have friends."

    nf_irc.6.t:0 "Burned Tongue's Rebellion"
    nf_irc.6.d:0 "The Canadian People's Front once stretched over the Canadian Prairies, a quickened and darker mirror of pre-war life that we were too weary-boned to fight in its inception. In the advent of nuclear war, they were able to establish a firm, near-undeniable control for decades that went largely unchallenged by all except one. \n\nChief Burned Tongue (named such as his tongue was taken from him by CPF Soldiers) formed a new band in Saskatchewan, operating largely between Battleford and Saskatoon, plundering and pillaging trade routes to prevent eastward expansion from Redmond. While this was successful for a time, the fruits were not for us. The 'king' Gunn of Manitoba used this newfound weakness to create his own Kingdom, splintering into yet another domineering faction with the help of CPF aristocrats. \n\nWith Burned Tongue's exploits taken out from under him, his anger only grew. He and his band continued fighting for independence until their defeat by the hands of Lydia Donskoy of the Ministry. While her continued existence remained a galvanizing point for the First Nations, her death came as a brick to communal purpose."
    nf_irc.6.a:0 "With her death, vengeance became paltry."

    nf_irc.7.t:0 "Friends in the Inuit"
    nf_irc.7.d:0 "Various groups from the Inuit will traverse the Great Blizzard on scavenging runs and trade endeavors. In the past, some of them have made such trades with us, leading to a renewed and healthy trade thanks to our proximity to the blizzard. Thanks to their willingness to help, we've had much better luck with ice fishing and Frostlurk hunting, allowing us to get proper nutrition again."
    nf_irc.7.a:0 "In times of need, we are lucky to have friends."

    nf_irc.8.t:0 "A Dying History"
    nf_irc.8.d:0 "Cree, Nakoda, Métis, Haudenosaunee-- all cultures from all over the Canadian Prairies and beyond, now pushed to an impossible brink. What culture survived centures ago has been further challenged by wasteland warlords, and we've lost. Many of the old songs are gone, taken from us by ambitious sycophants, and we've nothing to show for it but our camps here in the desolate north. \n\nMany of us still cling to our old cultures, and we're right for it-- but with so much lost, the differences and meanings have begun to bleed together. We have names, but little faces. Even so, we have ourselves, and we must manage. We cannot fall to the wayside. \n\nWe can still do this."
    nf_irc.8.a:0 "At least, we have to try."

    nf_irc.9.t:0 "Men From Out of Town"
    nf_irc.9.d:0 "Twisted men from MANIFEST North came into town today seeking a sacrifice to bring back to their master. Though they reeked of unnatural fire in their bones and carried with them weapons of war, Chief Howling Wolf stood her ground and told them they would be leaving empty-handed. They laughed in our faces, firing three bullets into the air. They said they will be back soon. \n\nWe must be ready."
    nf_irc.9.a:0 "We will not give any more than we already have."

    nf_irc.10.t:0 "Those Who Live in This Blizzard"
    nf_irc.10.d:0 "§ROut there, sport, there's a few people who ain't in our "sphere of influence," so-to-speak. See, they've taken to calling themselves some sort of "Iron Confederacy." Old-world indian types and whatnot. See, up until now, they've been mighty generous, giving me everything I needed to run my little experiments 'fore you all came 'round, but, well... Seems they've grown a conscience, and that means my goodwill's running dry. Why don't we go give them a message of what I think of their newfound independence?§!"
    nf_irc.10.a:0 "History repeats itself."

    nf_irc.11.t:0 "The Pakoseyimowin Massacre"
    nf_irc.11.d:0 "The Scarlet Blizzard burned with the embers of burning Tipis, ethereal fire from the deputies of an American ghost scorching away all of the local resistance. They lied in wait, ensuring the warriors were out fighting Umbravores before striking at the village under cover of night and thickened snowfall. \n\nHowling Wolf returned home to find her people scattered in the snow, only barely gathering them back together in the ensuing nights with the aid of the other hunters. No doubt that Destiny's deputies are still searching for stragglers, hoping to drag them deeper into the blizzard and into the heart of MANIFEST North..."

    nf_irc.12.t:0 "The Location of Little Treasures"
    nf_irc.12.d:0 "Our warriors found the location of Little Treasures-- a laboratory wing spiked off of MANIFEST Saskatchewan. We were able to infiltrate and gather records from it detailing every last Faerie ever made, down to their name of birth and their "faerie" name. \n\nWhile we can't undo their condition, we can at least bring them home, be it to us or elsewhere."
    nf_irc.12.a:0 "Even after the apocalypse, mad science thrives."

    nf_irc.13.t:0 "Banishing A Red Spirit"
    nf_irc.13.d:0 "The people of the Confederacy have had many foes throughout the centuries, ones that set them again and again on a course of oppression and disaster. Some of them have passed from this world already and others are out of reach, but the specter of the CPF proved otherwise. They had proven to be entirely within reach, and only now had met its end. Its destruction, long in coming, was a time of celebration for some and catharsis for others. For Howling Wolf it was something of both. She sat alone for a time while not far away there were bonfires burning and songs echoing through the night air. \n\nHer hope, her fire, had been vindicated and while this would not solve all the Confederacy’s problems on its own it was an important victory to show those who had teetered on the edge of despair. In particular she hoped that it would ease her father’s rest. It had been enough reflection and thinking however; the voices of her people cried out for Howling Wolf to come and join them and she had every intention of doing just that. Tonight would be a night remembered for as long as people were left to remember it, and she wouldn’t spend it all lost in thought and memory."
