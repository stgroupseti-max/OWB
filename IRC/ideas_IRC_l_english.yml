    irc_without_a_means_desc:0 "We have much in the way of old power armor taken from the U.S. Government, but we've little in the way of producing new suits, even from our scraps we have. For over two centuries we've passed down the same old faithfuls to our most stalwart protectors, and without a steady means of replenishment, we may no longer be able to do so."

    irc_trapped_in_the_blizzard_desc:0 "With nowhere else to go, we've been forced into an impossible situation. In our efforts to preserve our culture, we were inched deeper and deeper into the Scarlet Blizzard. \n\nIt was never an ideal option, but it was our only one, or so Chief Rolling Thunder thought. Though some still believe we are free to live as we wish out here, there is no life to be had in being in the web of an American ghost's failed experiments."

    irc_the_hunters_desc:0 "The Umbravore is a fake creature, but its meat is very real. On its own, it serves as a pale reminder of the tales of Windigo, though its truth is more grim depending on who you ask. It is one of few food sources in the Scarlet Blizzard, and most of which will require armored, experienced hunters to take down-- something very scarce in these times."

    irc_umbravore_diet_desc:0 "Though it wasn't anyone's first option, the only true sources of food large enough to sustain the various bands in our care are the Umbravore. Inconsistent and insufficient, they lead to various deficiencies in our diet... But they keep us alive, at the very least."
