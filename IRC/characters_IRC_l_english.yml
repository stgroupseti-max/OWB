    IRC_JESEBELLE_NAME:0 "Howling Wolf"
    IRC_JESEBELLE_DESC:0 "The modern Iron Confederacy is a far cry from its predecessor, being a collection of ghosts sent to die in the blizzard. Between the Canadian People's Front, The Electorate, and the Kingdom, they were gradually pushed out between the decades of endless conflict and disregard for the natives of the land. Unlike her father, Howling Wolf has no interest in bowing to the ghost of American Exceptionalism. She is determined to lead the Iron Confederacy into a brighter future, one where they can eat well and stand proud once again."
    IRC_HOWLING_WOLF_ADVISOR_DESC:0 "Howling Wolf has lived her life in service to others, doing the best to ensure her father's legacy was not that of failure. While he may have lived his life on the run, forsaking the lineage of figures such as Big Bear and Burned Tongue, going so far as to lead his people and others into a dark blizzard, she has made it her mission to lead them out of it. \n\nWith luck, perhaps her two sons will grow to be as she was, and understand the actions of her father without despair."
