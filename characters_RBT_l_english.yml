    RBT_DORAS_DESC:0 "Among the Rib Breakers, there is always Doras.\n\nIt is a heralded title passed down from one warrior to the next in a sacred tradition unbroken since the skies were set ablaze from the heat of the world furnace. It is the duty of Doras to guide the generation they belong to, lead hunting parties to gather fresh bodies and ensure that none breaks their unending chain of succession."
