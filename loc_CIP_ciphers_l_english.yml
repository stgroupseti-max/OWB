  ##Focus Tree
  CIP_subtracting_troubles:0 "Subtracting Troubles"
  CIP_subtracting_troubles_desc:0 "Our fortunes can switch between positive and negative in the blink of an eye. Recently a number of matters have come up for the tribe that will need to be addressed."
  CIP_leaving_los_alamos:0 "Leaving Los Alamos"
  CIP_leaving_los_alamos_desc:0 "When the sky and earth split in the fires of armageddon, the ancestors of the tribe refused to stay put at a research facility called Los Alamos. Instead, they travelled out into a hostile world."
  CIP_shadow_of_the_mesa:0 "Shadow Of The Mesa"
  CIP_shadow_of_the_mesa_desc:0 "Mesa Verde, our home, was founded in the cliffs, built onto the stone mesa rising high above the desert below. Here is a natural defensive position, keeping us secluded and safe from the incaluable dangers of the wasteland."
  CIP_the_prisoner_numbered_13:0 "The Prisoner Numbered 13"
  CIP_the_prisoner_numbered_13_desc:0 "2 decades ago now, a strange woman visited our tribe. The number on her back fit her life, or so the Nemonik said then. 13."
  CIP_adding_a_turbine:0 "Adding A Turbine"
  CIP_adding_a_turbine_desc:0 "All the power Mesa Verde requires is supplied by a single wind turbine, constantly maintained for nearly two centuries. Constructing an additional one would greatly increase our capacity to power tools and buildings."
  CIP_enhancing_the_kiva:0 "Enhancing The Kiva"
  CIP_enhancing_the_kiva_desc:0 "The Kiva is the great pit at the center of our village, wherein the first Ciphers carved the walls with schematics before they could be lost to time. All our people study there to learn history, math, and our rites."
  CIP_counting_guns:0 "Counting Guns"
  CIP_counting_guns_desc:0 "Functional guns can be hard to come by in the canyons. We'll need to take inventory of which ones are currently functional and which can be repaired to properly distribute them amongst our people."
  CIP_multiplying_blades:0 "Multiplying Blades"
  CIP_multiplying_blades_desc:0 "In comparison to firearms, usable melee weapons are easier to gather or forge. All of the Ciphers are trained to defend themselves from a young age, they merely need the equipment to do so."
  CIP_improve_the_water_array:0 "Improve The Water Array"
  CIP_improve_the_water_array_desc:0 "The village depends on the ancient water arrays leeching water from the air to supply us with enough to drink each day. Trig believes she could use supplies she recently traded for to improve their function by 22.1%."
  CIP_new_miracle_wheat_crop:0 "New Miracle Wheat Crop"
  CIP_new_miracle_wheat_crop_desc:0 "To handle mistakes made in the past, the Prisoner brought us seeds of miracle wheat, a crop that also cleans radiation from the soil. We've carefully maintained our stock each year to ensure our small greenhouse stays healthy."
  CIP_constructing_new_dwellings:0 "Constructing New Dwellings"
  CIP_constructing_new_dwellings_desc:0 "Mesa Verde has always had strict limits on the numbers that could reside in it. Recent improvements to food and water mean we could, in fact, allow additional Ciphers to stay here each year."
  CIP_dividing_supplies_with_the_nomads:0 "Dividing Supplies With The Nomads"
  CIP_dividing_supplies_with_the_nomads_desc:0 "Each band must supply itself for most of the year, but they all visit the village to exchange goods between us. It would be wrong to not fairly share recent gains between them."
  CIP_relentless_foragers:0 "Relentless Foragers"
  CIP_relentless_foragers_desc:0 "In recent years the Hangdogs tribe has forced many other bands out of Dog City, forcing them into the nearby hills we were once free to traverse. Not least of all are the Foragers who have set up at the edge of our territory, and now harass our nomadic families. Counter Azkee has begun plotting a solution that will change our equations forever."
  CIP_out_from_the_mesa:0 "Out From The Mesa"
  CIP_out_from_the_mesa_desc:0 "Despite the Nemonik's warnings, Azkee is gathering the nomad bands in the canyon to begin his assault on the Foragers. Time will tell how this course of action plays out."
  CIP_calculated_risks:0 "Calculated Risks"
  CIP_calculated_risks_desc:0 "Numbers always function as intended. Battles are not quite so simple. Sometimes one must accept an unknown if they are to win an offensive assault."
  CIP_proofed_tactics:0 "Proofed Tactics"
  CIP_proofed_tactics_desc:0 "The tribe has typically avoided conflict with others, but we are not without our own methods of fighting."

  CIP_our_theorem_desc:0 "With the Foragers defeated, the tribe gathers in Mesa Verde to determine the future course."
  CIP_counter_azkee:0 "Counter Azkee"
  CIP_counter_azkee_desc:0 "Returning the same sum again and again has left us stagnant. Although unconventional, Counter Azkee's changes may be needed to bring prosperity to the Ciphers of Mesa Verde."
  CIP_his_postulate:0 "His Postulate"
  CIP_his_postulate_desc:0 "Azkee has made a proposition. A postulation, to be precise. The Counter believes that, in order to provide us with a calculation that results in a sum that is more positive than that of previous counts, we must place faith in him. A faith not only in his abilities, but a faith in Azkee. When the calculation is determined by the Counter, what else can we do but accept?"
  CIP_accounting_for_all_factors:0 "Accounting For All Factors"
  CIP_accounting_for_all_factors_desc:0 "We have never been one to weigh ourselves down with the burden of economics. We certainly do not deny the exchange of goods and services via a sum of currency, but we are also not slaves to it. But the Counter, having learned of a mythical Pre-War group known as the 'bean-counters', seeks to learn their ways, so that we may better follow them."
  CIP_charging_a_battery:0 "Charging A Battery"
  CIP_charging_a_battery_desc:0 "Battery, born into the tribe, has long wandered away from our borders. Having come into a position of authority among the groups of Black Canyon, now may be a good time to reach out to our wayward son."
  CIP_revisiting_the_laser_cannon:0 "Revisiting The Laser Cannon"
  CIP_revisiting_the_laser_cannon_desc:0 "Many years ago we defended the villages with a powerful laser cannon, created by Trig by upscaling laser pistol schematics. While that one exploded spectacularly after a single successful firing, with new supplies we could attempt to construct a new version."
  CIP_coefficient_partnership:0 "Coefficient Partnership"
  CIP_coefficient_partnership_desc:0 "The Maxson Brotherhood has a great wealth of knowledge and equipment. Azkee wishes to reach out to them to see how we might benefit each other."
  CIP_alternating_course:0 "Alternating Course"
  CIP_alternating_course_desc:0 "Numbers, statistiks, mathematiks. All these have been of great help to the Counters and Nemoniks of the past. But we had reached a point where we arrived at the same sum, no matter what changed in the Count. To truly break out of this cycle, the Counter must not factor in only the Counted, but the Unknown Variables as well..."
  CIP_limited_arc:0 "Limited Arc"
  CIP_limited_arc_desc:0 "The young Counted ask: 'Why do our arrows fall to the ground, yet a laser beam stays straight and true?' The truth, while a long and complicated one, has to do with that of the theorem of old. Many Counters and Nemoniks coming together to agree how the world worked through observations. But each observation brought a new law. And laws... laws can be broken."
  CIP_off_tangent:0 "Off Tangent"
  CIP_off_tangent_desc:0 "Truly, the faults of the Counted continue to build. Not even a season has passed that it has been discovered that even our structures do not follow proper tangental properties! If there exists no point of tangence, what good are our homes at all, if only to make us all the more vulnerable to numerical impurities?"
  CIP_equal_members:0 "Equal Members"
  CIP_equal_members_desc:0 "An oft-repeated statement of the World Before was that 'some are more equal than others'. But we know better. Through the power of the Counter, members of society can have mathematikal statistiks made of themselves, profiled to the point of mathematikal perfection. Based off a collection of based-ball cards brought from the outside, so too shall we follow in their footsteps."
  CIP_unexpected_angles:0 "Unexpected Angles"
  CIP_unexpected_angles_desc:0 "By all accounts, a projectile's ricochet makes both perfect sense, yet no sense at all. Yet while a bullet can ricochet, an energy blast from a plasmabringer or laser pistol does not. What sorcery of impossibility makes this so? And more importantly, can it be overcome?"
  CIP_organizational_matrices:0 "Organizational Matrices"
  CIP_organizational_matrices_desc:0 "The based-ball cards were of help in providing statistiks for our 'most valuable performers', yet it does not go far enough. The Counter's prized calculation compiler has not seen this much use since he first received it. But the Counter is one man. And we are a tribe of many. There must be machines that make this easier."
  CIP_irrational_members:0 "Irrational Members"
  CIP_irrational_members_desc:0 "Unknown Variables are a threat no matter where they may be found. An X that cannot be solved. A circuit that does not fit into its board. A dissenting member of the tribe. The last of these, we have begun seeing more and more of in recent weeks. We must make examples of them, otherwise, our tribe's X will equal 0."
  CIP_researcher_ratio:0 "Researcher Ratio"
  CIP_researcher_ratio_desc:0 "Our continued study of schematics continues apace, and many promising developments are on the horizon. Catching up to and surpassing neighboring settlements will require us to push more and more folks into such labors. Perhaps additional food and accolades will bring volunteers?"
  CIP_creative_quotient:0 "Creative Quotient"
  CIP_creative_quotient_desc:0 "The desire to learn is positively infectious. The elders share their books of formula and decades of practice with the youth. They, in turn, will advance our understanding and pass it along to their children."
  CIP_weight_of_ambition:0 "Weight Of Ambition"
  CIP_weight_of_ambition_desc:0 "Our goal of returning home is unlikely to be easy. Those barring our path are strong, and their allies stronger yet. But their actions have made many enemies as well.\n\nNow that we have proven ourselves in the canyons, many warriors from outside the tribe will answer our call. Be it for glory, spoils, or simply vengeance."
  CIP_homeward_vector:0 "Homeward Vector"
  CIP_homeward_vector_desc:0 "Los Alamos. Our home. Has it truly been so long that only the most learned and wisened know of its significance? This shall not stand. Prepare the tribe. Gather your pocket protectors. Sharpen your spears. This day, we go to war. And let no one stop us!"
  CIP_infinite_potential:0 "Infinite Potential"
  CIP_infinite_potential_desc:0 "We've done it. Through countless mathematikal equations, trials of faith, and the mathematikally perfect leadership of Azkee, we have retained our homeland. No more living in cliffs, no more scrawling on walls. From this day forth, we live anew. We live like our forefathers. In perfection."
  CIP_the_nemonik:0 "The Nemonik"
  CIP_the_nemonik_desc:0 "Azkee may be right about the need to proactively protect ourselves, but the equations passed down to us have never failed before. Our future cannot be secured from the dangers of unknown variables except by trusting conventional wisdom."
  CIP_unforgotten_roots:0 "Unforgotten Roots"
  CIP_unforgotten_roots_desc:0 "The youths of the tribe are taught many things whilst entering the age of self-reliance. But the most important lesson of all is that they are never to forget where they came from. Los Alamos may never be ours, but we have made a new home for ourselves. Mesa Verde has lasted for centuries, and for centuries more, it will last. That is what the tribe is taught."
  CIP_path_of_least_resistance:0 "Path Of Least Resistance"
  CIP_path_of_least_resistance_desc:0 "Why try and solve X + Y = Z, all to the power of n, when we can simply take the far simpler path of 2 + 2 = 4? In this case, 2 equals isolation, and 4 equals peace and harmony, even if it will never reach the prosperity some wish to attain."
  CIP_direct_course:0 "Direct Course"
  CIP_direct_course_desc:0 "Sometimes the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. We need not concern ourselves with the tangled web of the outside when we can simply forge a line."
  CIP_broken_terminals:0 "Broken Terminals"
  CIP_broken_terminals_desc:0 "The Prisoner's fixing of the Terminal so long ago was a blessing and a curse. For each successful calculation made, each schematic recovered, the number of disk space grows higher and higher. Soon, we will run out of storage space. To remedy this, we must find and fix terminals. We may not have the Prisoner, but we have each other."
  CIP_median_compromise:0 "Median Compromise"
  CIP_median_compromise_desc:0 "Although we are not one for politics, a visitor from the outside world long ago introduced me to the idea of the 'horseshoe' theory. It went that, the more extreme a person or ideology, the closer they are to the opposite end of the line. I wish not to become an extremist, but I am also aware I cannot stay neutral forever. I have to make a stand."
  CIP_refreshing_the_paint:0 "Refreshing The Paint"
  CIP_refreshing_the_paint_desc:0 "Whilst many refer to us as the 'Painted People', few of us are painted. Rather, we save our paints for ceremonies, marking equations, and interpreting schematics. We may not know what they mean in full, but the paint never forgets. But paint has become limited. Maybe it's time to refresh our stock?"
  CIP_inducted_into_the_tribe:0 "Inducted Into The Tribe"
  CIP_inducted_into_the_tribe_desc:0 "Our enemies are Unknown Variables, but that does not mean we can simply erase them. Much like an error in a calculation can be corrected, so too can a man be brought around to our way of thinking. Although I must admit, the induction ceremony is rather uncomfortable to watch after the 11th failed attempt..."
  CIP_grounded_jumpers:0 "Grounded Jumpers"
  CIP_grounded_jumpers_desc:0 "Claim Jumpers. Wretched scoundrels who seek to claim everything as their own, and everything for themselves. Even now, they still hoot and holler in glee whenever they believe they've struck a 'claim' on our land. I am not one to encourage violence, but for wretches such as they, there is no other option."
  CIP_mean_compromise:0 "Mean Compromise"
  CIP_mean_compromise_desc:0 "The law of averages supposes that most future events will balance out the deviations of averages of the past. Azkee himself was a flaw, but his points were mathematikally provable. The last thing I can do as Nemonik is forbid the calculation of an equation."
  CIP_teaching_logarithms:0 "Teaching Logarithms"
  CIP_teaching_logarithms_desc:0 "In the recent years, we have seen exponential growths of everything from our population, to our resources, to our intelligence. Had you asked a decade ago, only I or the Counter could explain what exponential even meant. Yet not only are most aware of what it means, they're able to calculate what it will mean for us in the coming years. I couldn't be more proud."
  CIP_integral_territories:0 "Integral Territories"
  CIP_integral_territories_desc:0 "It only occurs to me now, but with our expansions of territory, people, and our understandings of technology, we have forgotten about a valuable aspect of the sum: The integral. I shall conduct one post-haste. It should make our newfound neighbors understand us much more."
  CIP_less_is_more:0 "Less Is... More?"
  CIP_less_is_more_desc:0 "A larger number is always larger than a smaller number. The tribe's resources, however, need to be stretched as far as possible. Careful conservation and efficient usage shall become our bywords."
  CIP_repeated_reflection:0 "Repeated Reflection"
  CIP_repeated_reflection_desc:0 "There are many lessons to be found in our memories. Even many years after the fact, the details of events benefit from new scrutinization. We were not wrong to live our lives as we have, but perhaps we should have secured the uranium better...."
  CIP_remaining_constant:0 "Remaining Constant"
  CIP_remaining_constant_desc:0 "Who are we, if we forget our history? The role of the Nemonik is to ensure continuity between the past, present, and future."
  CIP_local_games:0 "Local Games"
  CIP_local_games_desc:0 "There are times where even I need a break from my responsibilities. But I did not expect that games of chance would become so popular amongst the people. Games of landlords seeking to monopolize a board, cards that shall not surpass 21, I admit my favorite has become one where the player goes fishing. A simple, but very calming game. That is, until one plays the reverse card..."
  CIP_local_chaos:0 "Local Chaos"
  CIP_local_chaos_desc:0 "It seems that I spoke too soon, with the focus of bringing peace and stability to the people, I have indirectly caused more chaos and confusion. I must think of a way to solve this..."
  CIP_transformative_series:0 "Transformative Series"
  CIP_transformative_series_desc:0 "We have come a long way from our humble beginnings. It is hard to believe it was only a few decades ago that we were aided by a Prisoner. But we have grown since then. Mayhaps she may visit us once again, I have forgotten her face..."
  CIP_shift_through_the_memory_core:0 "Sift Through The Memory Core"
  CIP_shift_through_the_memory_core_desc:0 "Long ago, our ancestors travelled to Mesa Verde with a single computer in tow. It's memory core has been passed down with the Nemoniks for generations. Many schematics still reside within."
  CIP_sequence_with_no_beginning:0 "Sequence With No Beginning"
  CIP_sequence_with_no_beginning_desc:0 "The group which has overtaken the Circle Junction know not even their own origin. They stand no chance against our warriors."
  CIP_reciprical_action:0 "Reciprical Action"
  CIP_reciprical_action_desc:0 "Bombay Jack and his Claim Jumpers have a fondness for detonating explosives whenever our nomad bands pass by their territory as a show of strength. Now is the time to show them who truly possesses strength."
  CIP_investigating_coordinates:0 "Investigating Coordinates"
  CIP_investigating_coordinates_desc:0 "The wastelands holds many schematics beyond those already engraved in the Kiva. Perhaps some bands would be willing to delve into pre-war locations in search of new ones to protect."
  CIP_zero_point:0 "Zero Point"
  CIP_zero_point_desc:0 "Los Alamos was the beginning of our journey, where the first Ciphers began their wandering. Now things have come full circle, and while the inhabitants there seem unhappy to greet us, we know this is a momentous day for the tribe."
  CIP_recovering_a_calculator:0 "Treasures of the Menace from the West"
  CIP_recovering_a_calculator_desc:0 "We've heard only whispers of the great battle that occurred beneath the mountains here, in the mythical "Vault 0". Forbidden treasures left by the Menace from the West are said to sleep here."
  CIP_blood_from_a_boulder:0 "Blood From A Boulder"
  CIP_blood_from_a_boulder_desc:0 "The great facility in the city of Boulder was said to surpass Los Alamos in scientific research. Many have fought for it already; it would be a shame not to discover what lies inside."
  CIP_knowledge_of_the_bright_moon:0 "Knowledge Of The Bright Moon"
  CIP_knowledge_of_the_bright_moon_desc:0 "Diana, Goddess of the Moon, went by many titles among the Twin Mothers tribe. While we never sought conflict with them in the past, now that we control the lands of their tribe we can begin to add their numbers to our walls."
  CIP_secrets_of_the_dark_moon:0 "Secrets Of The Dark Moon"
  CIP_secrets_of_the_dark_moon_desc:0 "Hecate, Goddess of the Dark Moon, has been a harsh voice in the north ever since she rose to power. While her Daughters and her Hounds have both given us trouble before, it can't be denied that the limits of what could be learned from them are few."

Narrow, treacherous, and starved of resources, these passageways defy supply lines and strain even the most determined logistics. Defensive positions crumble under isolation, and heavy equipment is often abandoned to the biting winds. Extended campaigns here are rare; instead, the canyons serve as fleeting corridors for armies, conduits between more decisive battlegrounds."

  nf_cipher.1.t:0 "Leaving Los Alamos"
  nf_cipher.1.d:0 "After the end of the Second World War, the Los Alamos Laboratory found itself in need of projects for itself to take upon, due to companies like General Atomics, Poseidon Energy, and similar companies being founded and formed to create means of exploring, improving, and enhancing the nuclear infrastructure of America. Where General Atomics eventually developed the components of the AER-9, Los Alamos instead decided to develop the nuclear missiles that would eventually make their way into Ballistic Orbital Missile Bases. \n\nTheir research didn't end there, as various doctors, hoping to compete with Vault-Tec and a rumored Poseidon Energy AI, also sought to develop smaller and more productive computers. Although the Mathematical Analyzer Numerical Integrator and Automatic Computer (MANIAC) was the pride and joy of the facility, other doctors sought to develop a form of truly personal computer, as opposed to the primitive terminals paraded by RobCo and other software and hardware companies of the era.\n\nIn 2077, the Los Alamos Nuclear Research and Development facility recorded an combined civilian and military staff of over 15,000. At the end of the day on October 23, 2077, that number had been reduced to 80. 40 of the members had been underground during the Great War, informally led by Doctors Willem Clark and Sebastian, along with Colonel Green. However, at the nearby Los Alamos Nuclear Testing Facility, another group had survived aboveground.\n\nAlthough the group did not have the ingenuity of Clark or Sebastian, or the military stratagem of Green, the small group of scientists and soldiers bid their workplace goodbye, salvaging one of the few functioning prototype personal computers remaining, and sought to find a location that would offer shelter, as Los Alamos could no longer be their home any longer. Before setting off, the group decided to take..."
  nf_cipher.1.a:0 "...mementos of Los Alamos, in order to ensure they never forgot"
  nf_cipher.1.b:0 "...military equipment, to ensure that they would remain the last civilized group"
  nf_cipher.1.c:0 "...research documents, someday they may finish the projects started long ago"

  nf_cipher.2.t:0 "Shadow of the Mesa"
  nf_cipher.2.d:0 "After leaving Los Alamos, the scientists and soldiers came across a group of other survivors. Although finding the group gave a burst of hope in restoring civilization, as the combined mass travelled further and further north, they only encountered horrors beyond belief. Cannibalism, mutation, raiding, all of these and more had become rampant in the area. Those who weren't spared of remaining mental stability were instead nearly feral monsters, operating only off instinct alone.\n\nWith the belief that they were truly the only ones in the area, if not the world, left to carry on the torch of civilization, the group finally made headway when they discovered an archeological site seeking to preserve the Native American pueblos at Mesa Verde. It was certainly no Los Alamos, but they would make do.\n\nUnpacking their equipment, a quick inventory check found that the group carried only a limited amount of working technology with them. The soldiers had ballistic pistols and rifles, with a handful of energy weapons among them, and the scientists carried the single computer salvaged from Los Alamos, enough parts to build several water makers and a crude wind turbine to power them, several lead-lined boxes containing enriched uranium, and a small supply of medicine. It wasn't much, but it would have to do. \n\nOver the course of the next decade, the group built up Mesa Verde into a basic, yet primitive, functioning village. But the computer, which they had salvaged, had now begun to fail more often, threatening to shut off permanently. To preserve what little civility remained in the world, but most importantly the knowledge of future generations, the scientists carved and painted electronic schematics into the Kiva, or pit, of the village. From there, an important sacrifice had to be made:"
  nf_cipher.2.a:0 "They would use up much of their uranium to power the computer in its final days."
  nf_cipher.2.b:0 "Without proper maintenance, the guns of the soldiers could not last in the Mesa."
  nf_cipher.2.c:0 "The Greenhouses ran low on fertilizer that year"

  nf_cipher.3.t:0 "The Prisoner Numbered 13"
  nf_cipher.3.d:0 "Over the course of the next century, the group, now formally known as the Ciphers, proceeded with endless memorization of the electronic schematics, becoming mathematical experts, even if they had little to no clue what they meant or what they were even calculating. While the Ciphers slowly deviated from the original goal of remaining "civilized", the village of Mesa Verde would remain central to the tribe, with many members who left Mesa Verde pledging to return to it at least once in their lives.\n\n2253 was perhaps the most important four-digit number the Ciphers would have for decades to come, as that was the year that the Prisoner left Tibbets Prison, and made her reputation known throughout the American Southwest. In September 2253, in defiance of refusing to translate a series of schematics for the Dark Mother Hecate, a band of Rattlesnakes was sent to attack and harass the tribe. The Prisoner dressed up as a Daughter of Hecate and ordered the group to stand down.\n\nIn addition, the Prisoner forged an alliance between the Maxson Bunker group and the Ciphers, allowing groups to prosper. The Ciphers welcomed the opportunity to put their skills and knowledge to the test, and in exchange the Brotherhood uses its firepower to shield Mesa Verde from its enemies. But this alliance did not last, as the ever-changing wasteland, along with the rise of Robot City and Scorpion's Bite, not to mention a particularly harsh Hangdog assault, resulted in the Brotherhood having to abandon the village.\n\nWith the Rattlesnakes gone, and a few years of Brotherhood coexistence, life at Mesa Verde returned to the normal routine of surviving from day to day. Most Ciphers remained nomadic, repairing whatever electronics they find and bringing a small measure of civilization back to the wasteland. But they never forgot the Prisoner and what she did for them. To the Ciphers, the best thing they remember about her was..."
  nf_cipher.3.a:0 "Her charismatic ways."
  nf_cipher.3.b:0 "Her strength."
  nf_cipher.3.c:0 "Her cunning."

  nf_cipher.4.t:0 "Our Theorem"
  nf_cipher.4.d:0 "Since the days of our founding, up until shortly after our tribe met the Prisoner, the leadership of the Ciphers has always been delegated between the Nemonik and The Counter, who is currently Azkee. But with the advent of the changing world, we have come to realize that we are not a group to sustain ourselves through segmented or divided leadership. We know not what the world outside holds in store for us, but it is certain that we must have a singular and strong leader lead us, lest we fall into Impossible Numbers.\n\nAzkee has grown wise since his meeting with the Prisoner, but still dreams of more. With decades of age molding him from newfound leader to wizened Counter, he has come to find discrepancies with the Counts he makes, that neither he nor those before him had encountered. Yet with all his dreams and ideas to set right what has been found to be wrong, many elders and older residents within the tribe are weary of once again shifting the tribe's culture towards what seems to be an impossible tomorrow.\n\nThe Nemonik, on the other hand, dreams only of tradition. While they too met with the Prisoner, their experiences after their fateful meeting has only reinforced his soured view of the world outside, deeming it a waste of time. For that reason, he seeks to protect the tribe, and to have many of those who have left return to Mesa Verde to live the rest of their lives in peace, as well as honor our founders by returning to where our tribe began.\n\nUltimately, the choice of who would become the ultimate leader of the Ciphers was resolved, as..."
  nf_cipher.4.a:0 "...Azkee used his Counting ways to ensure the tribe would burn with the fire of the possible."
  nf_cipher.4.b:0 "...the Nemonik rallied the traditionalists and elders of the tribe to ensure his rightful place as leader."

  nf_cipher.5.t:0 "Free Charge For A Drained Battery"
  nf_cipher.5.d:0 "Though much of the world was no longer the same as it was, [CIP.GetLeader] never anticipated that young Battery would come to have such an electrifying change on the world, let alone in what they had created in the nearby "nation" of Black Canyon. In the span of two decades, they had turned it from a raging band of raiders, tribals, and aggressively materialistic settlers, into a unified land.\n\nWhile the Counter was adamant about how the success of Black Canyon should determine how the Ciphers should forge their own path, and the Nemonik took Black Canyon's growing instability as a sign of coming weakness or even collapse, the majority of the Ciphers looked upon Black Canyon not out of fear or out of respect, but out of curiosity, as they had been taught since they were born.\n\nUltimately, that curiosity was answered with two envoys, one loyal to Azkee, and one loyal to the Nemonik, journeying to Black Canyon to meet with Battery. Although Battery was certainly surprised and humbled by his old tribe making such a show out of his newfound leadership, he understood the significance of what the use of two envoys, rather than one, represented for the tribe. \n\nGracious as he was for his tribe not losing their way, Battery of Mesa Verda was ultimately forced to make a decision that may come to shift the future of the tribe for years to come..."
  nf_cipher.5.a:0 "Azkee's request for Black Canyon's resources was the only logical option."
  nf_cipher.5.b:0 "The Nemonik's need for Black Canyon's assistance in trying times was one Battery could not refuse."

  nf_cipher.52.t:0 "Nothing Outlasts The Battery"
  nf_cipher.52.d:0 "It had finally happened. He didn't know how, or why... well, he did, but he didn't have time to dwell on them now. All that mattered was that he made it home, the only lasting consistent part of his turnabout life that had somehow stood the test of time.\n\nWith a final jolt of speed, motivated by seeing the first living person in weeks, Battery collapsed into the arms of Hex...\n\nIn his coma-like stupor, Battery saw only blurs and muffled words. Descriptions of the fractured Canyon. All of it being his fault...\n\nThat was, until another voice answered his thoughts.\n\n"So you screwed up. Everyone has. Could've done a better job, sure, but I don't think anyone else came as close as you did. Now get up, Battery. If there's one thing ol' Jake Caulwell knows Battery for, it's that he goes. And he keeps going. And going... and going..."\n\nJake's voice faded from its rough monotone into an excited announcer, as Battery's vision cleared to reveal that he was in a hospital building he hadn't seen since his youth.\n\n"And going... going, gone! Yes, that ball is outta there, folks! What a wonderful ball game this is here at DayGlo Stadium! I've never seen anything like it, and what a fantastic home run for the-"\n\n[CIP.GetLeader] turned off the radio.\n\n"You're awake it seems. It's good to have you back, Battery.""
  nf_cipher.52.a:0 "Let's get you some clean clothes and something to eat. We have a lot to discuss."

  nf_cipher.6.t:0 "The Big Gun"
  nf_cipher.6.d:0 ""I just don't see the point in rebuilding it is all! We scared off those snakes years ago!"\nIsaac knew trying to talk Trig out of something was like trying to convince a Mole Rat not to dig, but he still had his limits. \n"But what if the conflict repeats? Rattlesnakes. Foragers. Soon Circle Junction and Claim Jumpers? Too much of a pattern, violence will continue to increase, the tribe must protect itself."\n"But that thing barely worked the first time, is it worth the parts to rebulid it?"\n\nIsaac had a point. the Massive laser cannon had worked - once - and blew itself apart in the process. But Trig was confident in her abilities now, she had learned plenty in the last 20 years, and that explosion... truly magnificent!\n"It won't be like that this time! I can optimize it! Use new schematics to make it even better than before, one that won't explode! This isn't just an upscaled laser pistol, it's a totally new invention!"\n"I still think the resources would be better spent on normal weaponry."\n\nHe turned, noticing meticulous footsteps of Azkee's approach, and gestured towards him. "Counter Azkee, maybe you can help talk some sense into Trig. Should we really be using limited supplies on rebuilding the Laser Cannon, or devote them to more practical, smaller weapons?"\nTrig shot him a glare. \n"Or maybe you can tell this washed up soldier that we can't rely on old schematics forever, and it's time to think big!".\nAzkee stepped forward after a moment of contemplation to resolve this unbalanced equation with a simple input."
  nf_cipher.6.a:0 ""Isaac has experience, we should make more practical weapons.""
  nf_cipher.6.b:0 ""It is time to experiment with new ideas, let Trig build her cannon.""
  nf_cipher.6.c:0 ""Neither of your claims add up, we need these resources elsewhere.""

  nf_cipher.7.t:0 "A Coefficient Partnership"
  nf_cipher.7.d:0 "It had been many years since anyone in the Ciphers had thought of the brotherhood, except of course Isaac. Even in his retirement he could never escape occaisonally thinking of them. Years ago, they came to visit the Ciphers, an alliance forged by the Prisoner. The Ciphers shared their knowledge and got protection, occaisonally repairing broken equipment, and in return got protection from all dangers of the wastes. When the chapter left to finish their mission in Denver nobody thought it would be long, they would see their strange friends soon enough. But when he heard of their expulsion at the hands of the Hangdogs, just like the Foragers, he had begun to make peace with their deaths, to accept he made the right choice in leaving. At least, until he spotted a set of unmistakable armor shambling towards the Khiva through the valley..."
  nf_cipher.7.a:0 ""Did they survive?""
  nf_cipher.71.t:0 "Fate Of The Maxson Chapter"
  nf_cipher.71.d:0 "Yes, it would seem they did. The lone knight had marched all this way on a mission from the new Elder, Andrea. Isaac was relieved to hear that the chapter had managed to defy the odds and survive the bloodbath of Colorado, and joined the others in greeting their visitor. He shared stories of their battles with the Scorpions Bite, a whole city of Robots, and the mighty Hangdogs themselves. Azkee was just as relieved to hear of their success and came to give the Knight a message of his own.\n"Tell your new Elder that we seek to restart the mutual loop - a return to the old pattern of cooperation. The Ciphers are willing to help you again if you will keep us safe once more.""
  nf_cipher.71.a:0 ""Our knowledge summed together will exceed its addends after all!""
  nf_cipher.71.b:0 ""Why stop at knowledge? We could add all our strengths!""
  nf_cipher.72.d:0 "...No, they did not, not for long at least. When Isaac went down to greet the Knight he saw a weary man, cautious but relieved to see friendly faces here. The Maxson Chapter had survived - briefly, but their luck ran out soon after. Their refuge at Senator Peterson's bunker had been overrun, and most of the survivors either captured, enslaved, or recruited off to a new life. The knight in front of them had been scouting ahead for one of the bands of survivors that fled capture or dishonor, and now sought refuge with the Tribe that had once helped them before. When Azkee heard of their plight he did not hesitate - their addition to the tribe would only increase the success integer of both groups. The refugee band was welcomed in, along with whatever technology they could save in their journey west - and stories of those who defeated them. Isaac was happy to see them come, even if the faces had changed so much in the past decades as to be like strangers. Still, he couldn't resist the sorrow of knowing that he had been right in the end."
  nf_cipher.72.a:0 ""I always knew it would end this way.""

  nf_cipher.8.t:0 "Infinite Potential"
  nf_cipher.8.d:0 "Counter Azkee stood in the observation deck of the Los Alamos facility, looking out at the pockmarked landscape. The Ciphers' return to the home of their ancestors had been... not what any had expected, but it was still an opportunity. A great many schematics existed here, as well as minds who understood them. Or had crafted them wholesale! Even now, the remaining Ghouls of the Reservation were teaching the tribe knowledge that had long been lost, and combined with what was already learnt, much good could be done for the Wasteland.\n\nGood for the Wasteland. Not just the Tribe. Once a novel concept to the Ciphers, Azkee had tought them to embrace what their knowledge could do for everyone, just as the Prisoner had shown them decades ago. Though the tribulations had been many, and the calculations difficult, the sum had proven positive. A buzz on the intercom called him, and Counter Azkee knew that he must resume his work. A Counters' responsibilities never end, especially if they now extended to more than just one Tribe."
  nf_cipher.8.a:0 "The schematic of life is ever growing."

  nf_cipher.9.t:0 "Transformative Sequence"
  nf_cipher.9.d:0 "With the last tribe of the mountains defeated, it seemed that the Ciphers were finally beginning to know true peace again. In the end the Nemonik had gotten all he wanted - their technology had improved in areas that would not threaten their way of life, and the Ciphers could protect their ways without being lost to the machines. Their numbers had grown so much recently, and the Nemonik, in his many years, was finding it harder and harder to keep track of their sum. He pondered it all as he sat in the Khiva, playing cards with old friends. Perhaps it was time to finally train his successor. Eventually every Nemonik would fade; Like any machine the human brain only has so much memory to store. It was time for another to take up the mantle, to enscribe the schematics and history of the tribe into their mind and guide their trajectory, hopefully on another simple progression like his. Even with the proof in front of him, it was hard to accept these things. \n\nHis mind wandered to some 20 years ago, when their tribe first met the strange Prisoner from Tibbets. It seemed like everything had changed then, their meddeling for better or worse had helped prepare the Ciphers for their current success. The Nemonik had always wondered if they would come back one day, to see how it had all turned out. As he reminisced, a glit of something familiar in the corner of his eyes stirred him to action. He left the game ignroing the protests of his tribe and stumbled weakly to the edge of the Khiva, to see what was out there. A silhouete in the distance, with a sacred number 13 upon its back. Was it her? Had their lucky number finally come back?"
  nf_cipher.9.a:0 "Or was it just an imaginary number?"

  nf_cipher.10.t:0 "Zero Point"
  nf_cipher.10.d:0 "Los Alamos had always been something of a legend among the Ciphers - it was where they came from true, but after all these years they could remember so little about it outside of the diagrams and schematics. [CIP.GetLeader] was among the first to see it as they crested the radioactive hill. The radiation suits Trig had repaired were holding up fine, but something didn't add up - why was Los Alamos so radioactive still? They had heard tales of Ghouls living in the area, even fought off a few, but never expected it to be this bad. As the expedition ventured inside they found most of the facility locked behind a great door with a complex keypad. It was a simple Cipher, one that they all knew and passed down, to get through the lock. What was not so simple was the gun [CIP.GetLeader] found pointed at his head, and the ghoulified soldier pointing it at them.\n\n"How'd you get in here? Nobody left alive should have known that code. There's nothing here for you, it's all... ruined. Go away."\n\nThe Ghoul looked them over for a moment, only pausing when he saw a tiny logo on their suits, barely legible as it flaked with age.\n\n"Wait.. those suits... well damn, I thought they all died." \nHe lowered the gun, slowly\n "Alright. You tell me everything, I tell you everything. But from the look on your faces... you might not like what you hear.""

  nf_cipher.11.t:0 "Zero Point, Cont."
  nf_cipher.11.d:0 "The truth, it seems wasn't what the Ciphers were hoping for at all. The ghoul before them, Colonel Green, heard their origin myth and could only laugh\n\n"So that's what they told you? A heroic exodus? A journey out from their home, the safety of Los Alamos to start a new life somewhere else? No. I was there. When the bombs fell and it all happened. Most of the base personel died in the initial blast waves and the Fallout, but some of the facility had been spared. But the shockwaves damaged the damn reactor, and the lower levels locked down, trapped half of us inside. There was only a single connection to the upper levels, a computer uplink I think. Yeah, MANIAC. The scientist on the upper level argued with Clark, said it would be impossible to override the lock without flooding the facility with radiation. They thought we'd be dead in the next 8 hours because we'd already be exposed, said there was no point trying to get us out. "They ran the numbers". So the bastards left while they still could and took what they could carry. It took 10 years for the system to end the lockdown, 10 years trapped in the dark. And after all this time... I don't blame them. I would have made the same call, at the time. We all did what we had to do, before, and after. What we did here when we got out, what Clark did... I can't look at you with a straight face and say we were anything worth saving."\n\n[CIP.GetLeader] took some time to process the new information. Had their ancestors really abandoned the rest of the facility to their fate? Where their calculations really so cold and pragmatic? This wasn't the origin they were looking for at all.\n\n"Look, you guys have the run of the place now. I can't stop you from looking around, I'm about all that's left. It seems like the team that left made a better impact on the world than us in the end. So much for building a new society and all that. Can't say you'll like what you find down below, the Great Project was... well it didn't have your kind's best interests at heart. But if you're going to do something with the place, just make sure it's better than what we were doing. But if you need help keeping the place safe, well, you could say I know a thing or two about that..."\n\nFor better or worse, the Ciphers now had the full picture of their origins, and had finally reached the Zero Point they began at."

  nf_cipher.12.d:0 "They came from the west, a small troop of armored warriors and robed scholars, who called themselves a Brotherhood of Steel. It was a name we had heard before; one of our number had once been a scribe in the ranks of a chapter based to the east. These were from another chapter though, one from a land called Mojave, that seemed to know us better than we did them. It was us they had come to visit, speaking of wanting to see the diagrams and schematics of the famous Ciphers. We had not known we were famous, we told them, but you are welcome nonetheless. They stayed for a time, their scribes spending long hours in speech with the Counter and their knights providing us additional protection during their stay.\n\nThey were interested in everything, everything written and drawn about the walls of the Mesa, everything passed down from the old days, everything we had learned. They listened more than they taught, but they were not entirely selfish in their visit. When we asked questions about their armor, their own history, what knowledge they preserved, they shared some of what they knew. It will help us as hopefully what we shared will help them. Eventually they packed up and bid us farewell, telling us it was time for them to return home as their people were always in great danger. "

When we met them now however it was no troupe of soldiers looking to visit that came down the road but a single robed man, a Father within their family. He was tired, worn out by both the long travel and the grief that lay upon him. Elijah was his name, and we gave him a space to lay his head and rest. It was not long before he was restless again however, and he told the story of how he had come to our lands. His own people had been attacked, time and again, until their great stronghold within a tower of light had been taken. Those of his chapter who were left abandoned him to follow another and Elijah was left to drift alone.\n\nFather Elijah has joined us for now, lending his expertise and mind to us. Already he begins to translate papers we could not parse for decades, and his unorthodox ways of thinking bear scientific fruit. Should he stay with us, we will surely benefit even if our own leaders are somewhat wary of him."

He was if nothing else a brilliant mind and helped us greatly in understanding some of our oldest documentation. The Counter and Nemonik however can at least be assured his thirst for control did not lead to some attempt at a coup. He spoke before leaving of his wish to find some of the Old World’s most secret and hidden treasure troves, that they may give him what he needs to avenge the losses and harms inflicted upon him. Should they still exist, should he find them, his foes would do well to prepare themselves. Elijah is no man to be trifled with."
