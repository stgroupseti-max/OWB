  MDM_penny_name:0 "Penny"
  MDM_penny_desc:0 "Everybody's favorite mascot is still here! Just as she is the face of Middlemark (TM), she is also the name of the sophisticated machine running the whole company network. Though she's had two centuries to increase sales, she's had to do so by cutting off more and more faculties of the original facility, leaving them to rot away as her reach gradually declined. \n\nHowever, with the help of some new friends, Middlemark may yet again break shareholder expectations..."

  MDM_friar_black_name:0 "Friar Black"
  MDM_friar_black_desc:0 "Friar Black has seen it all, from the downfall of the original managers to the exodus of the Miscounts. He may be a bit loonier than he used to be ever since he started wearing a television set like a helmet, but he's still got a knack for killing, maiming, and arson (through the form of incredible fire sales), especially when it comes to Wardens of the White. \n\nHe really, really hates the Wardens of the White."

  MDM_warden_name:0 "Petty Officer Kyler Rooker"
  MDM_warden_desc:0 "When Seattle got hit by the Immortal, Petty Officer Kyler Rooker ran as far as he could east, hoping to weather the storm and escape 'Purgers and other opportunists. What he didn't expect, however, was running into Miscounts near Lethbridge. After the rest of his squad was tortured to death, he made a desperate plea-- "keep me alive, and I'll help make the moon shine cherry red." Nobody knew what he meant by that, but Friar liked the sound of it and said "welcome aboard." \n\nOf course, just because he's on good terms doesn't mean he's off the hook-- but every raider needs a punching bag now and then, don't they?"

  MDM_metal_mark_name:0 "Metal Mark"
  MDM_metal_mark_advisor_desc:0 "In the third fiscal quarter of 2074, it was internally announced that Middlemark would be introducing a new mascot to serve as a companion to Penny. The new mascot, Mark, would serve as Penny’s robot boyfriend in a move investors were hoping would boost attendance through franchising. Plans had been hastily drafted to branch out into merchandise like toys, and a saturday morning cartoon, which had only one of its intended fifty episodes animated. Mark was created with the intent of being the perfect boyfriend, as well as a counterpart to Penny that appealed to boys in the 7-12 age range, embodying the adventurous qualities of both spacemen and cowboys that were popular at the time, while also programmed to be a doting partner who deferred to Penny. His deferential qualities were unpopular with the target audience, however, and he was quickly shelved due to abysmal results in the early phases of his focus testing. His costly development meant destroying him would cost Middlemark greatly and so he was instead relegated to backroom functions, strictly programmed to work in direct service to Penny."

  MDM_nickel_and_dime_name:0 "Nickel And Dime"
  MDM_nickel_and_dime_advisor_desc:0 "Fraternal twins, the brother and sister pair of Nickel and Dime have been considered Miscounts since birth. Raised by a single father, a respected Manager on Seattle's west side, their upbringing was strict in the ways of the raiders. By the time they were 11 they could price check kids twice their size, and working together they could get a grown man on his knees.\n\nWhen the Wardens rolled into the city, crushing all opposition with their iron fist, the two lost everything. Their home was stolen, and their father was captured and executed in the name of "law and order". Kept alive on the road to Calgary as much by spite as anything, they were among the first group to lay eyes on the massive shopping center that would become the gang's new haven.\n\nNow old enough to start leading a team of their own, the inseparable pair have become rallying figures for all those that desire vengeance on the Wardens of the White, no matter the cost."

  MDM_bill_banks_name:0 "Bill Banks"
  MDM_bill_banks_advisor_desc:0 "§N"You snotnosed youngins don't know a damn thing! You think I got the title of Manager from a fire sale? When I was your age, I forcefully acquired so much merchandise from Koover we bought the Maw out of jet that summer! With nothing but a rusty combat knife, I carved bar codes in the bodies of so many Rib Breakers they wouldn't come within a dozen miles of my store! And now look at me! A Greeter! You're lucky I can't remember where I stocked my pistol..."§!\n\nBill was the oldest Manager back in Seattle, possibly the oldest member the Miscounts have ever had. Stubborn fool he is though, his was the last crew to flee the city when the Wardens rolled in. By the time the gang made it over into Alberta he didn't have an employee to his name; they all either perished or flipped employers. Most folks couldn't tell you if Friar keeps him around out of respect or pity. Even giving him the rank Greeter is a formality; he listens to no one, and no one listens to him (they also won't give him ammo after what happened last time). Still, even as his mind goes, he's a staunch reminder of what makes a Miscount: swearing, salt, and threats of impending violence."

  MDM_ira_tenner_name:0 "Ira Tenner"
  MDM_ira_tenner_advisor_desc:0 "When the Miscounts were hired by Penny, many a strange job was handed out by the face of Middlemark. Anything the automation had broken down on was needing a fresh body, and somehow Ira was put in charge of the sandwich shop in the food court, even if the bread, veggies and meats had gone bad decades ago. Some may have taken this position as an insult, and Ms. Tenner sure as hell did. So after some yelling, hijinks, and bodies piled up, Friar Black put her in charge of all the food supplies in the mall. She took to the position well, with a sharp mind (and iron fist) for rationing the food the raider crews steal or trade loot for. Now you listen to her, or you're lucky to even get served the bad sandwiches for your meals. The ones with end pieces on both sides."

  MDM_grygoriy_kovalenko_name:0 "Grygoriy Kovalenko"
  MDM_grygoriy_kovalenko_advisor_desc:0 "§G"You smoothskins wanna learn how to survive aye? Well, gather round, let an old employee give you a lesson. Survival is in my blood. Or, eh, in what's left of my blood. My father was a survivor, my grandfather was a survivor, as was every man before him, all the way back to the old country. So, pay attention, and maybe you will live long enough to become more than a shelf-stacker."§!\n\nGrygoriy is an old ghoul, one of the few employed at Middlemark. The son of a Ukrainian immigrant, he claims to be descendent of a long line of survival experts, having lived through some of the hardest moments in history as great military leaders. Most people he talks to don't know what a Ukraine is, but hey, it sounds impressive. Having actually worked at Middlemark before the war, Grygoriy survived the bombs and quickly established himself as a local leader in his community. When the signs of early onset ghoulification began to show, he saw the writing on the wall and took off with a few of his fellow unfortunates, quickly turning to the raider way in order to sustain themselves. Centuries passed, yet he continued on. When he saw the lights inside his old store lit up once again, his old, quite literally, withered heart felt the pangs of a lost lover. Quickly impressing the Miscounts with his savvy business knowledge and survival skills, Grygoriy now once again patrols the aisles, like he did so long ago."

  nf_mdm.3.t:0 "Bones to Pick"
  nf_mdm.3.d:0 "Though the Miscounts are always 'happy to help,' they didn't come to Middlemark to play games and go right back to how things were. Sure, it's nice having a steady gig and a supportive boss, but as far as vengeance goes? Yeah. Yeah, they're really pissed off. Some of them don't believe they can do it, thinking the scars the Wardens gave them ran too deep-- but others? Oh, others asked the most important question of all. "What if we can do it all over again?" \n\nThe worst part? \n\nA lot of people said 'yes.'"

  nf_mdm.4.t:0 "The Needle Once Meant Miscounts"
  nf_mdm.4.d:0 "Seattle was not always home to the Brotherhood. It wasn't even always home to the Wardens. Before them, the Miscounts reigned supreme: a gang of raiders who thrived off of a sort of retail aesthetic, using modified price guns and bombs made out of cleaning supplies to terrorize and gather what they needed from the settlers. \n\nOf course, when the Wardens started cracking down on 'gang violence,' the Miscounts days were numbered. They gave them as much hell as they could, but the Wardens had the numbers, and so they were pushed out of the state. \n\nOf course, Middlemark was as natural a home as they could get-- and Penny was more than willing to let them have a slice of paradise, provided they became registered employees, badge and all. \n\nWith the Wardens gone from Seattle, and with the 'Immortal' now in their place, it seems the cards are falling back into the Miscounts favor..."
  nf_mdm.4.a:0 "Perhaps all that was can be once again."

  nf_mdm.5.d:0 "The Mountaineers of the Passkeepers have always been a quiet sort, staying out of the way of Wardens and Miscounts alike for most of their existence. Of course, that had recently changed-- with the word on the wind saying that Wardens were with them now. Goody-two-shoes Wardens, too. Some bitch with a nice smile and a look for helping people. \n\nNobody's saying anything has to happen to them, of course. Whatever this 'Foxtrot Uniform' means, it probably ain't bad for us. But it wouldn't be a bad idea to think about it..."

We found enough food in there before Middlemark that helped us make it by in the old city, but there were a bunch of old shitty boxes left around. Talking to Penny about it, it sounds like someone bought the tower, but never moved in-- something about a 'Nordikon'. Whatever that is. \n\nThey only left a handful of toys for us to make use out of, but Penny tells us the company went looking somewhere else, out east. Wonder if they ever got it finished...
