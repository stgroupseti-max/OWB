Caius began his 'career' as a soldier under Colonel Green on the Reservation, but he soon saw a need to protect ghouls across the Wasteland. And who better to do so than the Legion? The tribes whisper that Caius is already dead; but if that is so, who better to lead after Caesar's ascension?"

Following the death of Caesar, he was approached by one of the most unlikely sources, the leader of the Praetorian Guard. Lucius, in an attempt to try and find answers has Hadrian asked to teach him in the sacred teachings of Vulcan.

Following the rise of the Cult of Vulcan to the forefront of the Legion, now Magnus works to mold the Legion into a war machine unmatched by any other. In his eyes, slaves and civilians within the Legion represent an inefficiency, an imperfect tool which was poorly used by the Legion beforehand. Now the Forgemaster intends to rectify this inefficiency no matter how brutal the means, turning the slaves and craftsmen of the Legion into a forge that would rival even the industrial capabilities of pre-war America.

Noting that it was Power Armour that helped provide such an edge over his men many in the Legion would've seen it as a weakness to shed, but Trajan saw it as a strength to be assimilated. Now Trajan acts as a self appointed Hand of Vulcan following the Cult's rise to prominance and wishes to bring out this dream of his by making others see that the Cult is the path to a better Legion, a stronger Legion."
