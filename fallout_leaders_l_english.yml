  ACH_KATHRINE_TORNI_NAME:0 "Kathrine Ffion Törni"
  ACH_KATHRINE_TORNI_DESC:0 "§t"Sometimes I do wonder: what would Maxson have done?"§!\n\nKathrine Ffion Törni is a skilled sniper, infiltrator, and organizer. Her involvement with the Texan Brotherhood had quite a rough start, her mother being a high-ranking Lost Hills elder, Kathrine was sent to Texas shortly after birth in an attempt to keep her safe from the encroaching NCR.\n\nIn Texas, she made herself a reputation quickly. An adventuring youth, her exploits in Fort Hood alongside Rosado made her well-known and respected. These adventures were always done in line with the Brotherhood of Steel Codex, as her mother always spoke of its importance. Yet, her studies of the Codex only made it more apparent how far the Texan BoS had strayed from the Brotherhood's principles.\n\nAs an adult she joined the Circle of Steel, a secret police, designated to upkeep loyalty to Lost Hills. Still, there were just too many dissidents and traitors for a small group to deal with. A new plan was needed: splinter. They would gather all still loyal forces and form a new chapter, committed to upholding the Codex at all costs.\n\nIt seems, her plan was successful. But can the new chapter survive? With few in number and enemies on all sides, history seems doomed to repeat itself and the Alamo may fall again..."

The spectre of this dark event has hung over her tenure as Empress ever since, and her subsequent defeat at the hands of the Itza have only strengthened murmuring that she may be unworthy.  Despite all of this, the blind Empress knows that she can not afford to abandon the weight of leadership, for a terrible dream has haunted her for the last ten years.

However, Gale Kinkaid, the descendant of a man forcibly pulled from one of America's secretive bunkers, believes wholesale in the ability of the Aztlan to eventually defeat the Itza. His belief stems in no small part from his family's long naval history, which stretches back to the Second World War. Kinkaid has spent decades pushing for expensive naval reforms, much to the annoyance of his counterparts in the Army."

Quite probably that's the reason why he volunteered to lead the expedition to the Boulder Dome as well: at least that way he'd get to stay in one place and do research of his own.\n\nThe mishaps, troubles and accidents that befell the Dome mission have just made him more cynical, bitter and altogether, more of a workaholic than ever before - and it's quite easy to blame Victor Presper for all of this.

Arriving from the East with a band of highly-trained killers, the Bandido soon found employment in the crumbling remains of the southern Sinaloa cartel, stemming the luchadore advance with a mixture of tactical brillance and exceptional cruelty.

The towns of the southern Baja began to form faux-cities, fueled by the same corruption that sent the Moya family west.\n\nDespite owning a vacation retreat in the Boneyard, Guarez's empire lacked one thing, reach. It was here Villa and Guarez shook hands to unite the gangs of the peninsula under the dual rule of the §HValle§! and §GPaz§! factions, forming a funnel of contraband into the NCR. Guns, liquor, chems, and even people are brought into the north, with precious metals in return. California bleeds its riches for a taste of the outside wasteland, keeping the wheel of corruption spinning.\n\nNow Guarez's home in the Boneyard is a drug rehabilitation center under §MAllgood's§! anti-crime initiative, and §RKimball's§! rhetoric has formed a palpable layer of tension.

After being captured by the Blackfoot, he witnessed the foundations of the Caesar's Legion, and the suffering it brought to anything it touched. Civilization, progress, humanity. All trampled under the Legion's banner. As someone believed in ahimsa, non-violence at all costs, he opposed Sallow as much as he could. After all his disagreements with 'Caesar', he returned to Boneyard to inform everyone about the grim news.\n\n Returning home as a changed man, he became more and more involved in teaching the common man in California. He spent his days teaching communities how to grow their own crops, hurting the monopoly of the Brahmin Barons, drawing their ire. Despite all the harassment from the Barons, he continued to travel town to town, teaching everything he knew to improve the lives of countless people across all the wasteland. This act of selflessness earned him many followers who preached his ideals to the wasteland, elevating him to the status of a public figure against the corruption and ever-growing militarization.\n\n Growing wearier every day, seeing the Republic plunge into chaos after the coup was the last straw for him. He called a protest, and when he called, the Republic answered. Thousands of small folk rose up for the man who helped them in their time of need. With a stimpak on one hand and a rifle on the other, Calhoun represents the ordinary man and the Californian Way.\n"

All of the proceeds from smuggling have gone to improve the living standards of the Valle's residents, causing him to enjoy great support from his people. In recent years, however, the NCR has been increasingly aggressive, sending settlers to displace his people.

His old sympathies still hung around him, however: how could Clanton turn away the remnants of the Rangers, as broken as they were? After many sleepless nights he reached a compromise with himself, agreeing to let the Rangers settle down in the Cowboy Country if they agreed not to militarise. After all, Clanton couldn't risk Caesar's wrath. Caesar will come for them eventually, but maybe – just maybe – not today."

So watch your back, because if you mess with the Dryblowers, you'll have Lynch to answer to, and trust me, he really likes showing what his last name *really* means."§! - J.H. 'MFer' Christ\n\nJohn Lynch, a seasoned leader of the community known as the Dryblowers, emerged as a pivotal figure after a rebellion unfolded in the depths of Burham Springs and the Burning Mines. With a diverse group of former tribals, ex-slaves, and raiders at his side, John spearheaded their flight north, away from the clutches of the Daughters of Hecate, determined to forge their own path in the unforgiving wasteland. Although they began to settle into their newfound freedom, tensions simmered on the horizon.\n\nThe Dryblowers found themselves embroiled in a fierce war against Ouroboros, vying for control of the land taken away from their Dark Mother. John and his followers displayed their mettle, ultimately prevailing over their adversaries and liberating the slaves and tribals who suffered under Ouroboros' reign, and earning Lynch the nickname of "Lucan", in reference to his clever manipulation of canines, taught to him by one Jordan Dae.\n\nDespite this, the triumphant victory was only the beginning of a complex web of interactions. John Lynch, now known to friends and enemies as "Caveman", for his perceived backward viewpoints and situational approaches, now 51 years old, had steered the settlement towards prosperity since 2260, but his autocratic rule had garnered opposition from those like Marianne Sharp. Marianne advocated for direct democracy, actively working to undermine Lynch's authority and push for a different form of governance within the community. As defense remains a focal point for John, the internal tensions within the Dryblowers threaten to overshadow their successes and pose new challenges to their survival. A challenge the Dark Mother looks to act upon soon..."

This nomadic way of life led to their discovery of a largely abandoned rail station; the Iron Lines established a base of operation in this station to follow and eventually command the trains- naming it Circle Junction as an ode to their brethren out west. This junction quickly blossomed into a bustling trade hub, guiding trains from west to east, north to south, and incurred the attention of forces that would exploit this up-and-coming tribe.\n\nReferred to as the Iron Lines by those in Colorado in reference to the parallel lines painting the tribe’s bodies, the tribe themselves have forgotten what the tattoos depicted. As Circle Junction became a place for trade, slavers and raiders pilfered the naive tribe’s defenceless settlement, leaving only the weak and young, once again causing the homeless tribe to lose their identity once again...\n\nAlkaya was amongst those left behind orphaned at a young age; she escaped the surrounding chaos by playing in the abandoned train cars, giving her many places to hide in the often occurring raids, and allowed her to save the growing population of orphans in the Iron Lines from the slavers until one day they stopped coming. Now in her adulthood, she wishes to forge a stronger fleet, one in which the lines that paint their bodies may paint their canyon, and allow them to find their new path and identity, never to be stolen again..."

There, he rapidly rose through the ranks of the Ejército, the regulars of the Itza, partaking in a large amount of Chichen Itza's early campaigns beyond the Yucatán peninsula. His defining moment, however, was at the Battle of the Papaloapan River, where he rallied the routing Itzan forces to him following the death of their commanding officer. Under Sebastián's orders, the army would reorganize and counter-attack, fending off the Aztlán, and crowning him a hero.

Her silver tongue and quick wit earned her rapid promotions through the ranks of the Cancún administration, and many girls to boot, before she became the protégé of the Kalomte Sebastián II himself when he witnessed her efficiency first-hand during a visit to Cancún.

He soon became one of Sebastián's most trusted generals after displaying both courage and quality leadership during the rest of the campaign, earning himself the position as commander of the Ejército following Sebastián's successful coup."

  KHA_UNGERN_STERNBERG_DESC: "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the 'Mad Baron', and officially referred to by his noble title, Darkhan Khoshoi Chin Wang in the degree of Khan, had a troubled upbringing, constantly moving and with a father who was committed to an insane asylum. His family estate in Estonia was burned down in 1905, which confirmed his anti-peasant and eventual anti-communist beliefs. He eventually joined Pavlovskoe Military School in St. Petersburg, where he became interested in the occult and Buddhism. After graduation he was transferred to Siberia, where he became known for his heavy drinking and dangerous moods. In 1913, he moved to Khovd in Outer Mongolia as an officer in the detachment at the Russian consulate, after not being allowed to fight for Mongolian independence.\n\nIn the First Weltkrieg, Ungern fought first in Galicia then, after a two month prison stint following an episode where he attacked another officer in a drunken rage, he would serve once more in the Caucasus. After the breakout of the Russian Civil War, he fought with Semyonov and the Whites in Siberia, acting relatively independently in his personal crusade against the communists.\n\nUngern eventually travelled through China where he married Manchu Princess Elena Pavlovna, or ‘Ji’. Eventually, he moved to Urga, and defeated the Chinese garrison stationed there, restoring the Bogd Khan to the throne and proclaiming Mongolia independent.\n\nUngern himself did not get too involved in Mongol problems, but he kept the peace through force. After narrowly defeating a socialist revolution in 1921 and 1924, he was forced to get more involved. His forces prowled the streets as he hunted out dissidents and purged Mongolian society, including in temples. Though close friends and having similar ideas as the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, Ungern’s ambition knows no bounds. With Ungern’s grip dependent on his Russian military clique, there are fears he will continue to siphon power from the Bogd Khan for himself.\n\nThese fears were made manifest when Ungern was wounded in a battle with the Gada Meiren, falling into a brief coma and recovered prophetic, hallucinatory visions of Buddhist deities and ethereal spirits. Upon his reawakening, the Mad Baron was dead, and a new Khan rose to take his place. Maddened beyond comparison, Ungern now believes himself to be the reincarnation of Genghis Khan and the avatar of Mahakala, the Buddhist God of Death. Now, this great Khan seeks to restore the great Mongolian Empire old."

These two Followers, Bill Calhoun and Edward Sallow, were studying local tribal dialects; a field Graham was an expert in. Deciding to help their research, Graham became their translator, helping the research team move between tribes. In 2247, the group visited the Blackfoot tribe, and disaster struck. The group was prevented from leaving out of desperation on the Blackfoot's part: they were losing multiple wars. Refusing to be erradicated alongside the Blackfoot, Sallow taught the tribe everything he knew about warfare, and assisted them in annihilating their foes. Graham remained with Sallow, now dubbed 'Caesar', firstly as a translator, then general, and finally Caesar's Malpais Legate. Graham proved a brutal leader, committing horrendous atrocities in the name of the Caesar, and was Caesar's most trusted general: trusted so much he was tasked with leading the Legion's armies in the West. Graham's terrible deeds began to catch up with him, even as he ran to avoid them. Slowly but surely, his conscious was being eaten away, and the word of the Lord returned to him as a comfort. This the Caesar could not stand, for Caesar himself was the only 'God' tolerable in the Legion, but the Caesar was willing to put up with this as long as Graham's victories kept coming in. And so Joshua became the Burned Man. Eerywhere he goes, Joshua Graham commands respect: his eyes burn with hatred for the Legion as brightly as the pitch that he burnt in on the Caesar's orders."

Now that he holds office, a new spirit takes hold of the Republic, one of logic, science and most importantly, patriotism.\n\nAlthough there are rumors of Hayes being the descendant of old world politicians, the Enclave, many believe him to be the right choice for a growing republic regardless of his past, even relishing that it might bolster his abilities as president. In the eyes of voters, he has become not the strong man, such as Kimball, or the compassionate man, such as Allgood, but the smart man, one pushing us into the future- utilizing the past to accomplish this and rallying members of the Californian military to join him in this effort.\n\nCitizens and inhabitants of the wasteland alike prepare for the change he's promised to come, and the realization of the future that twinkles in Hayes’ eyes."

The stunning performance propelled the already successful seat-holding Boneyard politician into the national spotlight, gaining respect for his bold, incisive critique and netting his famous nickname of Allgood.\n\nIn the years following, he cemented himself as an enemy of the traditional Warhawks and Plutocrats of the NCR political scene, one not easily disposed of. After delivering his deciding speech, Allgood was granted the presidency, becoming an even more imposing problem for the corruption of the NCR, promising reintegration programs and peace.\n\nWith ties to the Followers and the Brotherhood, Allgood reflects the best of the NCR - a melting pot of the idealists who strove for a better life.  The NCR is now led by a man who is as ruthless towards his foes as he is compassionate for the vanquished - for does not true victory come from making friends of foes?  Although many of his critics lambast him as a pacifist, this could not be further from the truth.

When the makeshift idyll of Broken Hills began to unravel with the depletion of its precious uranium cornerstone and its mutant citizens migrated to Reno, Thradd became an idol among the mutant community as a model of stability and security for mutantkind. With the collapse of the fragile harmony between man and mutant in Reno, Thradd now serves as the de-facto leader in the otherwise anarchic streets of Reno.

For an ageing old man, it only signifies the end of the current era, and the dawn of a new era. But for the Ciphers as a whole, he knows that spiritualism and memorizing ancient schema will only help so much. For the tribe to survive in this rapidly changing new world, it must understand that, contrary to Counter Azkee's propositions of utilizing technology for all its worth, the only way forward that won't result in the tribe losing its place in the world is to retain the status it had when the Prisoner first visited.\n\nBut even as the Nemonik discourages technology, he recognizes the help it provided to many within the Ciphers. Were it not for Trig and her idea of a laser cannon, the Vipers may have turned Mesa Verde into another Dark Mother slave pen. If it weren't for the assistance of the Maxson Bunker Brotherhood, the Ciphers would not have survived the harsh famine that resulted from Denom's 'miracle fertilizer' mishap. And if it weren't for the Prisoner herself... Who knows what state Colorado-or even the rest of the world-would be in.\n\nThe Nemonik is not blind to the benefits technology has provided his people. But he has also seen and heard of what over-reliance and outright bans have caused. The Legion of Caesar, the Brotherhood, even their neighbors have all had different approaches to technology. But if Azkee's mathematics are correct-even as flawed as they have become in recent years-then the maths prove only that the Ciphers don't have much time before a decision must be made. Whether the tribe chooses the wisdom of the Nemonik, or falls to the temptations presented by Azkee, all the Nemonik hopes in the end is that the Ciphers survive..."

Born amidst the chaotic landscape of the wasteland, Face-Masher has become a master of deception and psychological warfare, partly out of necessity, and partly out of the sheer thrill. While the Riperult have gained a notorious reputation as cannibals, it is all part of an elaborate ruse to protect their land and maintain control over the towns under their watchful eye.\n\nOriginally known as Rult's Raiders, the group transformed into Rip-Rult, and later Riperult, after eliminating their former leader. Though Face-Masher allegedly claimed his name through the literal mashing of Rult's face, in reality, Rult was simply knocked out and imprisoned, with the resulting isolation causing Rult to slowly scar his own face until it resembled mashed potatoes. This symbolic act also caused Masher to earn his name, as he was the one to come across Rult and his grisly demise. Shedding their old identity in the heat of the moment and embracing a more fearsome image, Face-Masher, with his cunning intellect and commanding presence, stepped into the role of leader and became the face of their intimidating facade.\n\nUnder Face-Masher's guidance, the Riperult adopted an elaborate charade. By cultivating a reputation as cannibals, rapists, baby-eaters, and worse, they instil fear in those who might otherwise challenge their authority. The towns under their protection are obligated to play along with this facade, resulting in wilder and crazier stories of impossible acts of savagery, further solidifying the Raiders' control and reinforcing the notion that they are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nBut in reality, behind the terrifying exterior of falsehoods, lies a group of individuals who are simply trying to survive and protect their territory. Face-Masher, with his strategic mind and faux-fierce leadership, orchestrates a delicate balance between maintaining the illusion of brutality and ensuring the safety and prosperity of his people. Few truly know the true nature of the Riperult Raiders, and Face-Masher's enigmatic persona only adds to the air of mystery surrounding this formidable group.

The spiritual power of the Shaman-Kings is tied to the unique peculiarities of the Two Peoples' home. Situated along the Big Sioux, radiation from the Great War mutated the river's fauna to emit a nearly undetectable substance that can create the appearance of a blood red moon.\n\nThe first Shaman-King grew to lead his people by discovering how to control the emissions of the fauna. By clarifying the divine symbolism of the moon, with a red moon heralding a time of war and a white moon a time of peace, the Shaman-King secured power for him and his successors.\n\nEven now, 200 years later, the only ones entrusted with the secret of the Moon are the current Shaman-King and their chosen successor. This burden rests heavy on Boors Moon. How can he be the only one capable of leading his people?"

His heart pumps like the valley's echo, his veins are akin to engorged snakes slithering up his arms. Like his murky eyes the ritual scars on his face tell the story of centuries of pain and conquest.\n\nWhat his mind has forgotten the tapes help him remember; but his bones never forget. He was once a soldier says the tape--his muscles remember the drills. He has become a monster says the tape, yet he spends his days protecting others. The tape neglects the agony of his spasms in the lagoon, but his body remembers the feeling of his humanity being stripped away by §GF.E.V.§!\n\nAlone he stands as the quintessence of his kind; the children of the apocalypse.

The loss of his old home, the Twisted Hairs to Caesar's Legion made Ulysses obsessed with history and symbols. How individuals can impact the former and effectively become the latter, being totally aware of the weight their actions carry.\n\nUlysses has taken to the Divide, travelling through the storms surrounding the Divide to deliver vital packages to the growing settlement, seeing hope that the people there can build something truly great."

So watch your back, because if you mess with the Dryblowers, you'll have Lynch to answer to, and trust me, he really likes showing what his last name *really* means."§! - J.H. 'MFer' Christ\n\nJohn Lynch, a seasoned leader of the community known as the Dryblowers, emerged as a pivotal figure after a rebellion unfolded in the depths of Burham Springs and the Burning Mines. With a diverse group of former tribals, ex-slaves, and raiders at his side, John spearheaded their flight north, away from the clutches of the Daughters of Hecate, determined to forge their own path in the unforgiving wasteland. Although they began to settle into their newfound freedom, tensions simmered on the horizon. \n\nThe Dryblowers found themselves embroiled in a fierce war against Ouroboros, vying for control of the land taken away from their Dark Mother. John and his followers displayed their mettle, ultimately prevailing over their adversaries and liberating the slaves and tribals who suffered under Ouroboros' reign, and earning Lynch the nickname of "Lucan", in reference to his clever manipulation of canines, taught to him by one Jordan Dae.\n\nDespite this, the triumphant victory was only the beginning of a complex web of interactions. John Lynch, now known to friends and enemies as "Caveman", for his perceived backward viewpoints and situational approaches, now 51 years old, had steered the settlement towards prosperity since 2260, but his autocratic rule had garnered opposition from those like Marianne Sharp. Marianne advocated for direct democracy, actively working to undermine Lynch's authority and push for a different form of governance within the community. As defense remains a focal point for John, the internal tensions within the Dryblowers threaten to overshadow their successes and pose new challenges to their survival. A challenge the Dark Mother looks to act upon soon..."

  Alkaya_DESC:0 "§g"Our path, our past- it’s here somewhere... somewhere in this canyon, hidden by the junk, stolen by the slavers... It’s waiting for us."§!\n\nOnce a part of a larger tribe, far west of Colorado, the Iron Lines were exiled for unknown reasons, transforming into a nomadic tribe, following and charting out the old-world’s railroad system, worshipping the trains that traveled it as a prophecy that the old world would return, allowing them to escape the enslavement that many other tribes faced at the hands of the Legion and Hecate for many years. This nomadic way of life led to their discovery of a largely abandoned rail station; the Iron Lines established a base of operation in this station to follow and eventually command the trains- naming it Circle Junction as an ode to their brethren out west. This junction quickly blossomed into a bustling trade hub, guiding trains from west to east, north to south, and incurred the attention of forces that would exploit this up-and-coming tribe.\n\nReferred to as the Iron Lines by those in Colorado in reference to the parallel lines painting the tribe’s bodies, the tribe themselves have forgotten what the tattoos depicted. As Circle Junction became a place for trade, slavers and raiders pilfered the naive tribe’s defenseless settlement, leaving only the weak and young, once again causing the homeless tribe to lose their identity once again... \n\nAlkaya was amongst those left behind orphaned at a young age; she escaped the surrounding chaos by playing in the abandoned train cars, giving her many places to hide in the often occurring raids, and allowed her to save the growing population of orphans in the Iron Lines from the slavers until one day they stopped coming. Now in her adulthood, she wishes to forge a stronger fleet, one in which the lines that paint their bodies may paint their canyon, and allow them to find their new path and identity, never to be stolen again..."

This is the way of the Pursuant, and their huntmaster Max Tackett sits at the apex of this hierarchy. A heavily scarred and weathered figure who had stalked the marshes before even reaching manhood, Max is a figure of both awe and terror for his fellows. He took his place at the top of the Pursuant young, only fifteen years old, after bringing home a sack full of mirelurk king heads and killing the previous huntmaster.\n\nMax, while a brilliant hunter, is a heavy handed and harsh leader. His sense of humour is limited to the cat and mouse games he puts his prey through, and he has no patience for failures among his men. If they're not up to snuff they're as likely to be his next quarry as anything else. While the marsh is still his uncontested territory, the world is changing around the Pursuant. Power armored soldiers, robotic war machines, and hulking mutants have all emerged to encroach in recent years. It is up to Max to keep the hunters from becoming the hunted."
  The_Nemonik_DESC:0 ""§gOnce I was a keeper of memories, yet now I fear I am becoming one myself...

For an aging old man, it only signifies the end of the current era, and the dawn of a new era. But for the Ciphers as a whole, he knows that spiritualism and memorizing ancient schema will only help so much. For the tribe to survive in this rapidly changing new world, it must understand that, contrary to Counter Azkee's propositions of utilizing technology for all its worth, the only way forward that won't result in the tribe losing its place in the world is to retain the status it had when the Prisoner first visited.\n\nBut even as the Nemonik discourages technology, he recognizes the help it provided to many within the Ciphers. Were it not for Trig and her idea of a laser cannon, the Vipers may have turned Mesa Verde into another Dark Mother slave pen. If it weren't for the assistance of the Maxson Bunker Brotherhood, the Ciphers would not have survived the harsh famine that resulted from Denom's 'miracle fertilizer' mishap. And if it weren't for the Prisoner herself... Who knows what state Colorado-or even the rest of the world-would be in.\n\nThe Nemonik is not blind to the benefits technology has provided his people. But he has also seen and heard of what overreliance and outright bans have caused. The Legion of Caesar, the Brotherhood, even their neighbors have all had different approaches to technology. But if Azkee's mathematiks are correct-even as flawed as they have become in recent years-then the maths prove only that the Ciphers don't have much time before a decision must be made. Whether the tribe chooses the wisdom of the Nemonik, or falls to the temptations presented by Azkee, all the Nemonik hopes in the end is that the Ciphers survive..."
  RIP_Leader_DESC:0 "Face-Masher, the enigmatic leader of the Riperult, is a man shrouded in both fear and mystery. Born amidst the chaotic landscape of the wasteland, Face-Masher has become a master of deception and psychological warfare, partly out of necessity, and partly out of the sheer thrill. While the Riperult have gained a notorious reputation as cannibals, it is all part of an elaborate ruse to protect their land and maintain control over the towns under their watchful eye.\n\nOriginally known as Rult's Raiders, the group transformed into Rip-Rult, and later Riperult, after eliminating their former leader. Though Face-Masher allegedly claimed his name through the literal mashing of Rult's face, in reality, Rult was simply knocked out and imprisoned, with the resulting isolation causing Rult to slowly scar his own face until it resembled mashed potatoes. This symbolic act also caused Masher to earn his name, as he was the one to come across Rult and his grisly demise. Shedding their old identity in the heat of the moment and embracing a more fearsome image, Face-Masher, with his cunning intellect and commanding presence, stepped into the role of leader and became the face of their intimidating facade.\n\nUnder Face-Masher's guidance, the Riperult adopted an elaborate charade. By cultivating a reputation as cannibals, rapists, baby-eaters, and worse, they instill fear in those who might otherwise challenge their authority. The towns under their protection are obligated to play along with this facade, resulting in wilder and crazier stories of impossible acts of savagery, further solidifying the Raiders' control and reinforcing the notion that they are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nBut in reality, behind the terrifying exterior of falsehoods, lies a group of individuals who are simply trying to survive and protect their territory. Face-Masher, with his strategic mind and faux-fierce leadership, orchestrates a delicate balance between maintaining the illusion of brutality and ensuring the safety and prosperity of his people. Few truly know the true nature of the Riperult Raiders, and Face-Masher's enigmatic persona only adds to the air of mystery surrounding this formidable group. But how long until the lies end, and the truth is revealed?"

Tyrantus, a mighty war leader, directs them in such efforts as well as planning further raids against the tribe's rivals. Hecate herself is the worst of those rivals, with her people having stolen many of the Old Bones' sacred artifacts from the temple.\n\nTyrantus himself is a hot blooded man, unafraid of battle and easily slighted. He wears battle regalia carved and adapted from the sacred bones and holds his position by virtue of brute strength. His might is not without a weakness however; the festering wound in the earth at Burham haunts his nightmares and the lack of sleep dulls his wit.

She was at one time an indentured servant, a slave by any other name, punished for petty thievery. It was a miserable existence and Marianne was more than happy to put an end to it, and her master, when the 80s raid on Jericho provided the opportunity.\n\nLatching onto the 215th chain gang in their revolt and escape, she quickly maneuvered her way to the top of their pecking order. Marianne is a savvy woman, skilled at manipulating and ingratiated herself to the rough and violent folks beneath her. As a result the Overboss is quite popular within her gang, and they've followed her lead with only a token amount of infighting and dissent along the way. This goes both ways, and Marianne is fairly fond of her rowdy boys and girls and their penchant for explosions.\n\nBigger and better things await the 215th and the Overboss, at least if you ask her.

Following the sudden demise of High Elder Jeremy Maxson, Jonathan reluctantly assumed the mantle of authority, despite recent doubts about his physical and mental well-being stemming from a recent near-fatal encounter.\n\nDescended from the esteemed Roger Maxson, the revered founder of the Brotherhood of Steel, Jonathan carries the legacy of his family's storied past. Before becoming High Elder recently, as a high-ranking paladin, he fought valiantly on the front lines just outside the borders of the New California Republic. However, his heroic efforts were tragically cut short, leaving him marked by both visible and invisible scars, which many Scribes are predicting he may perish from if he does not treat them with urgency.\n\nJonathan's survival, albeit at a great cost, has raised concerns among the Elders. Questions linger about his ability to bear the responsibility of leadership, given the traumatic experiences he endured. Not only this, but even his wife, Jessica, plans on sending their only child, Arthur, out east, to the protection of Star Paladin Lyons' Brotherhood in D.C. Yet, it is precisely this history of sacrifice and personal struggle that shapes Jonathan's vision of the future of the Brotherhood. Maxson's are men of resilience and determination, driven by a profound sense of duty to honor the legacy of their shared ancestor and protect the ideals they and the Brotherhood hold dear. Some would call them the elitist hardliners, determined to follow the Codex to the letter no matter the cost. Jonathan sees it as a small price to pay for honoring the very man he owes his name to.\n\nWhile Jonathan may carry the burdens of his lineage and the scars of battle, he possesses a resilience and inner strength that sets him apart from the Rhombians, Cultists, and Reformists, maintaining an almost-religious dedication to upholding the principles of the Brotherhood and ensuring the safety of all people under the name of Maxson. Despite the doubts and challenges he faces, Jonathan is determined to forge his own path and leave an indelible mark on the future of Lost Hills"
