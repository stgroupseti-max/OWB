  los_the_church_of_the_lost_desc:0 "The Church of the Lost is the religion of the ghouls living within Los. Its followers try to follow a path towards achieving "Perfect Wisdom" - hoarding secrets and relics of the past so that they can be protected and used to achieve this state of perfect wisdom.\nAt one point, under Blake this church also practised values promoting Ghoul supremacy over humans - under the new leadership of Sappho those tendencies have been marginalized in favour of a individual path one can take to wisdom, rather than one that requires the subjugation of others."

  cbn_best_little_whorehouse_in_texas_desc:0 "There is nothing to be ashamed about what is happening between the walls of Carbon -  nor acting innocent why this little town have so many and so frequent visitors. There is a need, and all we do is provide a service to satisfy that need. Supply and demand - basic economics."

  los_high_priestess_sappho_idea_desc:0 "While she had to recede into the background, it doesn't mean that Sappho and her Church of the Lost stopped all operations. Not leading a nation has its benefits, as the extra time on hand will be advantageous for the spiritual life of the League."

  cbn_major_jasmine_idea_desc:0 "The Major of Carbon has less to do since her little townlet joined the League. Leading a town of a brothel still occupies her though enough, and frankly, she doesn't mind that she can actively participate in the operations either."
