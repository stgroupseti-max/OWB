    PAL_LEWIS_BRADLEY_NAME:0 "Lewis Bradley"
    PAL_LEWIS_BRADLEY_DESC:0 "Bradley was one of the many Wasteland youth who grew tired of sitting behind a brahmin all day. Unlike many of them, when he left the farm he fell in with a gang of raiders, and rose through the ranks. He seized power several years ago, and persuaded his gang that rather than harass caravans, they should seize the gold mines of northern Nevada.\n\nUnder Bradley's rule, the Elko Posse has become a force to be reckoned with; no longer a menace to caravans, but a threat to entire communities. Much of northern Nevada pays for his 'protection,' and Legion slavetraders find a ready market in his lands. Bradley now plots to seize Vault City, even as he fears reports that the Eighties have awoken under a prophet who will lead them home."
