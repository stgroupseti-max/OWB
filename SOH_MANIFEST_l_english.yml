  nf_manifest.1.d:0 "(The following is an audio excerpt from a log taken from Sydney Loke's quarters prior to her transfer to MANIFEST Dakota.) \n\n"So, Mom, I'm recording this—(she laughs, cursing). Okay, let me start that one back over. I'm recording this as a... Well, I'm not coming home for the summer, let's just say that to start off with. Why? You might be freaking out, and trust me, I did too, but I got it. I got the job at MANIFEST. They weren't joking when they said they had seen those College presentations I did about the Folkvangr stuff—they're giving me a grant and a team and everything and they're gonna have me move out to Regina to work. \n\nI know you can't talk back to me right now, but you were right. Someday I was going to be my own boss, haha! By the time this reaches you, I'll be working hard. Don't worry too much about me!""

January 28th, 2064 \n\nI've been thinking more and more about Ms. Loke and what she has to offer this company—her Fenrir project, especially. I imagine you've already considered the benefits of her AI drafts (if you bothered to read those emails, that is) with regards to the META teams works in Saskatchewan. Given the Red Fern developments, have you thought about getting in touch with her to set up one of her machines on-site to better facilitate processing and experimentation? \n\n§RTitle§!: RE: The New Girl \n§RFrom§!: JT010101 (Jeff Turner, Presiding META Executive)\n§RTo§!: MRainier (Michelle Rainier, Chief Executive Officer) \n§RSent on§!

Some of the locals have been trying to get a look at what we've been doing and I had to remain under the protection of some of our security personnel for a time. However, now that I'm back-in-action, I'll take a look! \n\nJeff \n\n§RTitle§!: RE: RE: The New Girl \n§RFrom§!: MRainier (Michelle Rainier, Chief Executive Officer) \n§RTo§!: JT010101 (Jeff Turner, Presiding META Executive) \n§RSent on§!

  nf_manifest.19.d:0 "// So, given the changed circumstances, Ms. Loke, we've been looking at this... Operation Folkvangr, was it?\n\n\\ Yes.\n\n// Right. Well, with the American teams now on board, some things have been “shuffled around,” so-to-speak, and we've been wanting to let you know about some changes that we made to the plan.\n\n\\ Wait, what—huh? What changes?\n\n(The audio crackles for seven seconds. The two talk over each at such a frantic pace that it's too hard to follow.)\n\n// I understand your frustrations, Ms. Loke, however, this “viking” AI isn't approachable in the slightest, and hardly matches the direction the company has been taking as of late—\n\n\\ You mean the same direction that now has people shot in the streets?\n\n// The same direction that calls for faces people can trust, Ms. Loke. As such, we've reintroduced the scrapped concepts of both DESTINY and HOPE as replacements. They'll be hosted on your already-existing hardware—\n\n\\ Derek's work? You replaced my—what do you mean hosted? What happens to FENRIR?\n\n// They'll be scrapped, and you will be relocated accordingly.\n\n(The audio fades to silence. A door slams shut. Sobbing can be heard before the tape runs its course.)"

Both are, well, mimicking a sort of “americana” that the executives say'll keep our shares up since the war.\n\n\\ That's cute. So, this is why Jessica came through here before?\n\n // Mhm. Using her likeness lets people attach themselves to them better, I think—associating them with the war and all.\n\n\\ I mean, wait—wouldn't that have the opposite effect? You know, making people think about the war, and all the posters, and, y'know—\n\n // Shut the hell up, Jamie. We paid a couple grand for it, and I sure as hell don't wanna be the one to tell the artists to redo it."

I just got it working on my desktop.\n\n(A shuffling noise gets closer. Then a keyboard rattles and its keys click rapidly.)\n\n\\ Wait, and why didn't you pack earlier?\n\n// Let's just say aunt Rowan wasn't happy I forgot to tell her I quit the rangers for the draft—\n\n||| ONLINE. HELLO WORLD.\n\n// Holy crap!\n\n\\ Good evening, Fenrir. Chester, meet Fenrir. Fenrir, meet my brother Chester.\n\n// Uh... Hi.\n\n||| HELLO. CHESTER.
