  MRR_JACK_REED_NAME:0 "Jack Reed"
  MRR_JACK_REED_DESC:0 "Those in the Marshall Republic are well suited to taking care of themselves, having passed down through the years a willingness to fight for their own and a keen understanding of both living off the land and scavenging what they need. That individualistic nature makes leading them an experience not unlike herding belligerent bighorners however. Such leadership is its own skill set, one that Jack Reed is doing his best to master as threats both from inside and outside the Republic threaten it."
  MRR_MARSHALL_NAME:0 "Marshall Jasper"
  MRR_MARSHALL_DESC:0 "Marshall Jasper has been around the block for over fifty years now, and this silver fox isn't going anywhere any time soon. A veteran of the battles in and around Grand Rapids, he's seen and shot enough fanatics for a lifetime. Too bad he's got a lot more to take care of."
  MRR_WITWICKY_NAME:0 "Marshall Witwicky"
  MRR_WITWICKY_DESC:0 "Marshall Witwicky's kept the Jacksons and their ilk at bay for a few years now. Though he's not much of a talker, he is known for his profound quotes such as "awesome" and "great job." His co-workers know him as the "guy who high-fives people a lot," and if you asked him, all he'd do is nod back."
