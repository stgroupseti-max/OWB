  news_global.1.d:0 "In the face of overwhelming pressure, the fragile ceasefire between the New California Republic and the long-beleaguered Western Brotherhood of Steel has collapsed.\n\nFor the second time in recent history, laser fire illuminates Maxson as the NCR and Brotherhood mobilize for a resumption of full-scale warfare. President [NCR.GetLeader] has made a speech proclaiming that "Brotherhood terrorists will be crushed," while the Western Brotherhood is expected to activate underground partisan networks and call in support from the many Brotherhood chapters scattered throughout the wasteland.\n\nAs fighting in Southern California quickly grows to an intensity that exceeds even that of the bloody guerilla campaign waged by the Brotherhood throughout the 2260s, one thing is clear: this will be the final war between Lost Hills and Shady Sands."

  news_cali.1.t:0 "The NCR Victorious in Navarro"
  news_cali.1.d:0 "Following the withdrawl or destruction of their remaining opponents, the New California Republic has once again emerged as the undisputed controller of the Navarro frontier. The culmination of a campaign to regain control of northwest California after fighting broke out between settlers aligned with the Shi, the NCR garrison, and the native tribes of the region, the NCR once again faces the task of taming California's last frontier.\n\nThe Bear - supported by a number of Brahmin Barons - has quickly taken steps to integrate the Navarro Territory into the NCR proper, bringing in a new swathe of settlers eager to extract the land's rich lumber and crops. For now, it seems the NCR is in Navarro to stay."

The culmination of an intervention intended to protect citizens of the Shi after fighting broke out between Shi settlers, the NCR garrison, and the native tribes of the region, the Shi now faces the challenge of turning California's last frontier into a new rice bowl.\n\nThe Shi has taken steps to integrate the lands of the former Navarro Territory into the Shi proper, bringing in a number of settlers eager to extract the land's rich lumber and crops. The domestic reaction of the NCR to this loss - as well as whether the Republic will make another attempt to regain the territory - remains to be seen."

  news_cali.3.d:0 "Following the withdrawl or destruction of the remaining opponents, the tribals of Navarro - banded together as the 'Free Folk' - have emerged as the undisputed controller of the Navarro frontier, seizing it from the NCR. The culmination of a war of independence after fighting broke out between Shi settlers, the NCR garrison, and the native tribes of the region, the Free Folk now face the challenge of defending California's last frontier from the major powers of the region.\n\nRumors persist, however, that the tribes were supported by - and perhaps even controlled by - mercenaries hailing from Eureka to the north.

Now with pro-NCR factions possessing even greater control over the Shi, this trend of cooperation is expected to continue.\n\nRumors abound that, under [SHI.GetLeader]'s instruction, the Shi will soon apply to become an Associate State within the NCR, formalizing the two states' alliance and bringing one of the last independent nations in California into the NCR's fold."

This news comes following months of debate on policy which culminated in the Mojave Defence Committee--the body assembled to determine the future of the NCR's expedition to the Mojave--declaring that it would lend its support to [MOT.GetLeader]. This event marks the conclusion of a long power struggle within the expedition, and in the wake of the Battle of Hoover Dam, the decision to replace a Congressional favorite has been received poorly by the NCR's government.\n\nUnder [MOT.GetLeader], NCR military strategy in the region is expected to radically shift, prioritizing operational flexibility and securing hardpoints along the vast Colorado River in preparation for the Legion's anticipated return to the Mojave."

A place where children worry about standardized tests instead of drug addiction. A place of pious prayer instead of mob hits.'

With Reno finally unified under a single family after decades of infighting, one of the West's largest cities is poised to begin a campaign of expansion in Nevada.\n\nFlanked by guards armed with plasma rifles, [NEW.GetLeader] announced that New Reno would be re-organized to provide 'only the highest quality of energy weapons.'\n\nTime will tell how the neighboring New California Republic, whose long history with the Van Graffs has always been tumultuous, reacts to the family's seizure of power."

Those efforts appear to have borne fruit, as the NCR has now effectively gained control of the peninsula - and by extension, the Gulf of California - without firing so much as a single bullet.\n\nAlthough many NCR citizens are displeased that the ringleaders of Baja's cartels have found new positions in the nascent state, the end of Baja's banditry will nonetheless come as a major relief to the people of southern California."

Hidden away in their citadel, they now exert their control over the entire area, seizing technology and turning away all they consider a threat. Little is known about their plans, though some claim to have seen a verti-bird from the west fly towards their base. Rumor has it that they seek to protect some lost trove of technology, while others say that they are in league with the Brotherhood in New California. Only time will tell what they have planned. "

  news_cali.31.d:0 "The Big Circle is often considered to be the most lucrative trade route in the west, reaching from Oregon down to the Mojave. Yet for many years, the Esmeralda valley directly to the south has often been too dangerous for traders to pass through, on account of unceasing conflict. That is, until now. Couriers and caravans report that Esmeralda has fallen silent, finally unified under a single power.\n\nAt the centre of Esmeralda sat a strange gem of the Old World, known as TV Town. Its purpose long since forgotten by those around it, all coveted its secrets and treasures. Yet none of them expected that the treasure would fight back. Refugees fleeing the fighting speak of human shaped machines smashing through their enemies, stronger and faster than anything bar the deadliest of deathclaws. These Androids have claimed Esmeralda as their own, and what this means for the Wasteland remains to be seen."

Raiders and brigands under the banner of the Hand Warband have launched an attempt to seize the lands belonging to the Lone Star trading republic. So far, fighting has been reported both along the I-20 and around the city of Lone Star itself, though it is not clear who holds the advantage.\n\nSpokespeople from other members of the Texan Economic Union have come forward in support of Lone Star, though were notably unable to offer any concrete answers on whether they aim to directly intervene in the conflict. As for the Hand Warband, some locals claim that they seek to imitate the Legion to the west, with some of their rank reportedly having served under the Mad Centurion Paullus.\n\nWhatever the ultimate outcome, Texas will be affected dramatically by this war."

  news_canada.1.t:0 "Nuclear Blast Over Strathcommune!"
  news_canada.1.d:0 "On Thursday, May 20th, 2275, residents of central Alberta awoke to see a sight that had not been seen in Canada in generations. Even from a safe distance, it was unmistakable: a mushroom cloud. For some time just before sunrise, a nuclear bomb lying dormant in its silo suddenly detonated without warning inside the nation of Strathcommune near one of their many dissident camps. In the panic that ensued, accusations were flung left and right as to the cause of this disaster, with Strathcommune alleging it to be an attack from foreign powers who infiltrated the site. The culprit behind the detonation is unclear, but Amy Teresee appears to be holding the people of Loid’s Ministry responsible for the explosion, an accusation which the Ministry responded to in outrage. The lands once belonging to the Canadian People's Front look almost inevitably poised for conflict once more as these two Socialist powers look to strike one another down."
  news_canada.1.a:0 "The Wreckers will be driven from Canadian soil!"
  news_canada.1.b:0 "Are we sure Teresee didn’t kill those dissidents herself?"
  news_canada.1.c:0 "We must prepare ourselves for the inevitable."

  news_canada.2.t:0 "A War On Four Fronts"
  news_canada.2.d:0 "In a sudden escalation of tensions, Strathcommune - high on war fervor following the nuclear detonation in their territory several months ago - has thrust the Canadian Plains into yet another large conflict. The army and Amy Teresse’s party’s outrage seems to have boiled over into full-blown revolutionary zeal, with the nation declaring war not only on Loid’s Ministry but also on the Pioneer Company, a Pre-War mercenary army occupying large swaths of former CPF territory. Not only this, but strange robots are emerging from the old RELCOM facility in Grand Prarie to take advantage of the chaos. Will this aggressive attack pay off for Strathcommune? Or will it be a race to Redmond for all those who seek to take advantage of Amy Teresee’s recklessness?"
  news_canada.2.a:0 "For Amy Teresee!"
  news_canada.2.b:0 "Was this truly necessary?"
  news_canada.2.c:0 "Redmond is within our reach!"
  news_canada.2.e:0 "Let’s hope Amy Teresse just took care of herself."

  news_canada.3.t:0 "Redmond in Flames!"
  news_canada.3.d:0 "Reports flood in from the North that the city of Redmond, capital of Strathcommune, is up in flames following occupation by enemy forces in the Commune’s ongoing struggle for control over a fractured Alberta. Amy Teresee’s failure has been made manifest as the very insurgents she sought to destroy now march her capital’s streets unopposed. Many onlookers hope this may be the beginning of the end of the Canadian People’s Front as they know it, putting the Canadian Plains one step closer to lasting peace. Only time will tell if the now-battered Commune’s resolve will be strong enough for their forces to turn the tide."

Teresee--no doubt only further emboldened by this victory--broadcast the announcement of this victory across the north: \n\n"Attention people of Canada! I, Amy Teresee, have come one step closer to your final liberation. Under my guiding hand, the revolution has brought justice to the Wreckers in Loidminster. We have destroyed the last monument to American imperialism and greed in Red Deer. And we have slain the crazed steel menace to the North in Grand Prairie. This is all cause for great celebration! With this victory, we bring an end to the long and arduous struggle for the soul of communism. To the workers of Canada, I say: hold strong! For once we recuperate and regain our strength, the Revolution will continue until all of Canada follows suit!""

For the Canadian People's Front, so caught up in infighting, has met a shocking, bitter end at the hands of its oldest enemy. Many in Canada would rejoice at the CPF's demise if not for who seems to have taken their place, as was announced in a broadcast received all across the north: \n\n"This is Colonel Jack Johnson of the Sixth Brigade. After withstanding a relentless assault by the communist elements in the area, we have reestablished Commonwealth control over Northwestern Canada and brought an end to the tyrannical Red Menace. To any other pockets of the Commonwealth army that remain, we order you to restore contact with Red Deer along secure channels immediately. In order to reestablish a greater union, we must collect our forces and strike out to take back our United States. From Anchorage to Laredo, from Los Angeles to DC, America must be freed!""

The Canadian People's Front's secular ruling party in Strathcommune has been ousted by revolutionary splinters, with a new government established by the socialist clergy from Loidminster to the east. Solomon Bouchard, its new leader, announced this victory in an address broadcast to all of Canada: \n\n"God has delivered us from a great evil. The tyrant Amy Teresee has conspired to take our lands from us, our homes from us, and our lives from us. God has guided our bullets and protected our homes. God has guided our strategies and the result is self-evident, and through him we have prevailed against the horrors the wasteland has wrought upon us. The only nation that will survive is the one that uses God as its foundation. We can find pride in our work--for it is good--but we must give God the glory he is due for our victory.""

Ekaternia Donskoya, its new leader, announced this victory in an address broadcast to all of Canada: \n\n"Now comrades, we have won just the first of many battles in the long struggle to come. A struggle for the heart of Canada. A struggle for the souls of the people. A struggle against the Fascists that surround us. It is a revolution we must fight on more fronts than the battlefield. We must feed the people, protect them from raiders, give them a chance to make a living. And we must educate them--most especially if they fail to see why our actions were necessary. The decadence of capitalism stands ever strong, its iron grip choking the working class. The people of Canada must be freed from its grasp.""

  MCA_COM_results.1.d:0 "In what is either the grand throwing off of America's legacy or a rebirth under a new interpretation, the [COM.GetName] and the [MCA.GetName] have announced the entry of the former into the [MCA.GetFactionName]. During the radio broadcast of the announcement, dipomats Shelley Gabryszak and Moton Betancourt stressed how two democratic movements came together for a shared dream of the continent, and that others who shared their values would be included. \n\n"We have a dream that all of America and Canadaria can be free," said Gabryszak. "We have the will to ensure it, no matter what some raider asshole thinks," Betancourt appended. Further questions from both nations' official broadcasters made clear what the future held: the [MCA.GetFactionName] were coming soon to a Wasteland near you."
  MCA_COM_results.1.a:0 "With friends like these, our enemies will fall!"

  MCA_COM_results.2.d:0 "After over two centuries, the occupation of Canada by American forces has formally ended. The [COM.GetName] has announced their willing annexation and integration into the [MCA.GetName]. \n\nDiplomat Shelley Gabryszak, who oversaw negotiations, had much to say over the radio about the choice of the occupiers. "The United States of America holds no power here," she said. "But its aspirations and dreams always will. The [COM.GetName] came to understand that to bring those dreams to the people of the north would require far more help than anyone realized. Together, from Grande Prarie to Yellowstone Park and beyond, all our aspirations will arrive, greater than anyone ever imagined.""

A movement to become a fledgling nation, the [MCA.GetName] has instead reversed its prior position, and once again seeks to rebuild the United States proper. Yet instead of listening to Chicago, [MCA.GetLeader] has chosen to put their trust in [COM.GetLeader]. "With our help, the former [MCA.GetName] will be reorganized as a member of [COM.GetFactionName]," Betancourt stated. "Under this future Commonwealth, we will see to it, to borrow from [COM.GetLeader], that America must be fuckin' freed. With our friends in Missoula, we're going to take back the continent against all tyrants." Further comments appended that any future democracies encountered would also be negotiated with, and that while Betancourt hoped the fate of Missoula wasn't a one-time thing, it wouldn't be the only option open to [COM.GetFactionName]."

Under the Calgary Declaration, a treaty of friendship has been signed by both parties. In exchange for the full recognition of Arcadian independence as a separate country and people not to be conflated with the United States (not to mention an addendum recognizing 'Canadarian' as an offensive slur), the [MCA.GetName] will receive full cooperation in the future defense and liberation of those under the yoke of oppression. [COM.GetLeader] made clear in no uncertain terms that the nation was not a puppet- Arcadia would never antagonize a fellow country, and were ready and willing to make future treaties with any future nations that could hear the broadcast. Raider gangs not counting, naturally."
