  ROS_origin:0 "Yellowstone Survivors"
  ROS_origin_desc:0 "The nation of Yellowstone is descended from pre-war park rangers, scientists, and engineers. The relative isolation of the park spared it from most of the damage of the bombs, and enabled them to begin anew, with an ideology based on preserving what was left. Together the remnants of Poseidon's Engineers, the EPA, and the old Park Rangers work in cooperation to ensure Yellowstone survives and remembers its' important heritage as one of the few unspoiled gardens left in the wasteland."
  ROS_hephaestus:0 "The Hephaestus Project"
  ROS_hephaestus_desc:0 "Our pre-war reactor Hephaestus is responsible for much of our prosperity, heating our homes and lighting our nights. Its origins, however, stretch back to a dangerous pre-war project that could have ruined the park - and still might."
  ROS_invasion:0 "Imminent Invasion"
  ROS_invasion_desc:0 "Wars are erupting all over the wasteland, and with our greatest secret leaking to the outside world, it seems inevitable that Yellowstone is going to be forced into war with its neighbors, or at least that's what the Rangers believe. The Ecologists are reluctant to admit this, to the people, and to themselves, but the writing's on the wall..."
  ROS_park_rangers:0 "The Park Rangers"
  ROS_park_rangers_desc:0 "The old Park Rangers still serve many essential roles in Yellowstone, coordinating defenses against Rangers and caring for the fragile ecosystem that remains."
  ROS_civil_path:0 "Focus On Civil Planning"
  ROS_civil_path_desc:0 "Yellowstone is quickly growing, and with that growth comes the need for more. More houses, more food, more clothes, more lights, more everything. The Ecologists recognize that consumerism and careless development were some of the greatest flaws of the old world, so we must take time to make sure our developments can keep up with growing demands in a eco-friendly way."
  ROS_arm_citizens:0 "Arm our Citizens"
  ROS_arm_citizens_desc:0 "The people of Yellowstone generally own a gun or two to protect their families from Deathclaws, Bears, and even the occaisional Bison that causes problems in the park. But with the threat of military invasion, it's time to ensure every citizen is armed and trained to defend their home from a professional army."
  ROS_war_path:0 "Prepare For War"
  ROS_war_path_desc:0 "War is not a popular idea in Yellowstone, but when it comes to us we have no choice but to defend ourselves, and the environment we protect. Remember the old scout addage: Be Prepared."
  ROS_agriculture:0 "Invest In Agriculture"
  ROS_agriculture_desc:0 "The volcanic soil of Yellowstone is kept fertile by occasional ash released by Hephaestus, and combined with the water from the geysers makes the park some of the best farmlands in the entire region. While the Ecologists are resistant to clearing more land for farms, better integrating the family farms into connected co-ops could help improve output and efficiency with minimal loss of wilderness."
  ROS_infrastructure:0 "Connect the towns"
  ROS_infrastructure_desc:0 "Connecting the disparate settlements throughout the park will enable greater specialization, allowing us to focus production where it is most needed; A quarry in every town just tears open the earth everywhere, while a single deep quarry can minimize impact to a single site."
  ROS_workshops:0 "Open Up Workshops"
  ROS_workshops_desc:0 "For what industries we do need to survive, self-sufficiency is vital. We will open up dedicated workshops in every town, where every citizen can learn to produce what they need themselves, from tools to clothes to furniture."
  ROS_new_deal:0 "Revitalization Effort"
  ROS_new_deal_desc:0 "Sea-Bastion has settled into their position as First Ecologist, and is preparing a new initiative to revitalize Yellowstone. While most Ecologists grew cautious over the years about any new technologies being dangerous to the environment, Sea-Bastion believes we should pursue a path of sustainable progress."
  ROS_defenses:0 "Build Border Defenses"
  ROS_defenses_desc:0 "The Colorado mountains provide massive natural barriers with few points of entery into our land, that our enemies are forced to march through. Fortifying our borders at these points and keeping the invaders out entirely is our best chance to protect Yellowstone and its people."
  ROS_tactics:0 "Mountain Defense Tactics"
  ROS_tactics_desc:0 "The Rangers have long since fallen out of practice, focusing on keeping order in the park and keeping tabs on local wildlife. Its time for them to hit the books we've saved and learn to be like the Rangers of the old stories."
  ROS_emergency_rangers:0 "Emergency Ranger Training"
  ROS_emergency_rangers_desc:0 "With training underway, it's time to start arming our Rangers for battle and developing specialized equipment to keep up with the Power Armor and steam-machines fielded by our neighbors."
  ROS_militia_training:0 "Citizens Militia"
  ROS_militia_training_desc:0 "Relying on Rangers for our defense has worked in the past, but then we were fighting tribes and raiders, not mechanized armies. It's time we mobilize the people of Yellowstone to an army of our own!"
  ROS_settlement:0 "Encourage Settlers"
  ROS_settlement_desc:0 "Yellowstone is a safe place, with reliable access to food, low levels of radiation, wildlife kept in check, and raiders kept out by the mountains. Settlers from across the north find their way here regularly and settle down, bringing with them new ideas and experience. We should encourage this phenomenon by inviting refugees from the wars in Montana to settle here."
  ROS_car_tomorrow:0 "The Car of Tomorrow... "
  ROS_car_tomorrow_desc:0 "...Is a train car. There are many who join us from afar confused why we rely upon trains for our transportation, when we could clearly build cars. The truth of the matter is that the original Ecologists banned all large motor vehicles that aren't absolutely necessary from being used in the park, to prevent their environmental impact and pull communities closer together. So long as the train network runs on time our people can reach any corner of the country with a trip on the train and a short walk, and that's exactly how we like it."
  ROS_recycling:0 "Recycling Initiative"
  ROS_recycling_desc:0 "Before the war, recycling was regarded with some cynicism as a pointless fad that did little to actually help the environment against to the damage that coroporations were doing. Now it's a necessity, and we need to make sure that every possible resource that can be re-used is. Starting local recycling centers could help, even if they're as simple as scrap piles outside workshops for people to pick through."
  ROS_adirondack_style:0 "Embrace the Adirondack Style"
  ROS_adirondack_style_desc:0 "The Adirondack style was an architectural style developed in the Adirondack mountains of the east, emphasising natural materials, the use of open spaces, and living immersed in nature. The National Park Service adopted it as the official style hundreds of years ago, and examples of the style still dot the park's landscapes. Embracing it will not only give the park its own sense of shared cultural identity, but help distribute and hide our industries and population within nature."
  ROS_mountain_workshops:0 "Mountain Workshops"
  ROS_mountain_workshops_desc:0 "Isolated cabins in the mountains have long served to provide shelter and retreat to the people of Yellowstone, often with extensive root cellars and even crude hydroponics. Hiding more of our industries within the mountains themselves could enable us to rapidly increase productivity without compromising the environment."
  ROS_poseidon_energy:0 "Study Poseidon Energy Data"
  ROS_poseidon_energy_desc:0 "The Poseidon Energy labs have been underutilized since they were shut down by the first Ecologists, left to rot for fear they would tempt researchers to return to exploitative mindsets. While they may be right to be cautious, ignoring the years of advanced research on energy systems is wasteful when we could put it to use for a noble cause. It's time to open up the archives."
  ROS_excavate_workshops:0 "Excavate Poseidon Workshops"
  ROS_excavate_workshops_desc:0 "Poseidon Energy had a number of auxiliary workshops underground to support the Hephaestus project's development. These workshops are still connected to the grid and have fallen into disrepair, creating energy leaks we'll need to repair to fix our grid. Reactivating the workshops once excavated will just be an added bonus."
  ROS_poseidon_methods:0 "Advanced Manufacturing Techniques"
  ROS_poseidon_methods_desc:0 "Poseidon used innovative assembly techniques to build Hephaestus underground, including cutting lasers, construction robots, and even powered exoskeletons. Implementing some of the advanced technologies left behind with some oversight should increase our production rapidly."
  ROS_poseidon_energy_weapons:0 "Poseidon Energy Weapons"
  ROS_poseidon_energy_weapons_desc:0 "Poseidon Energy was, after all, a military contractor. Studying the Apollo laser pistols they left behind makes the Ecologists feel a bit shameful about their ancestors works, but the innovative power cells could offer crucial insights."
  ROS_poseidon_armor:0 "Hermes Armor"
  ROS_poseidon_armor_desc:0 "The HERMES combat armor was a prototype upgrade of MK II Reinforced combat armor developed by Poseidon Energy before the war, that never moved out of the prototype phase. The notes available make clear the Poseidon were very secretive about its' development, as some other organization held exclusive rights to the end-product. Finishing it requires advanced polycarbons and other plastics that are too destructive to mass produce, but we could learn a thing or two from its' construction."
  ROS_EPA:0 "The EPA"
  ROS_EPA_desc:0 "In the pre-war world there was an organization, the Environmental Protection Agency, meant to regulate human progress to advance without destroying the planet we share. Unfortunately corruption and mismanagment was common in the pre-war world with companies bribing the EPA to ignore their violations, or business-first individuals being appointed to positions within the agency."
  ROS_emission_standards:0 "Emission Standards"
  ROS_emission_standards_desc:0 "Automotive vehicles were banned in the park shortly after the war, with only Motorcycles technically escaping the ban. Still, the EPA feels the need to regulate new vehicle production to their standards, creating more reliable and longer lasting electric bikes and motorcycles."
  ROS_concrete:0 "Volcanic Concrete"
  ROS_concrete_desc:0 "The ancient Roman Empire built structures that lasted over 2000 years using concrete made with volcanic ash. While we must be mindful of this long-term impact, we could use the ash of Hephaestus to build a network of eternal bunkers across our territory."
  ROS_war_support:0 "Rally The People To War!"
  ROS_war_support_desc:0 "War is still unpopular in Yellowstone, but a solid moral justification helps. We need to make clear to our people we're not just fighting for our survival but our way of life, and the protection of the natural world all around us. All it will take is a few well crafted speeches and revealing the ugly truth about the crimes commited by the Enclave or the zealotry of Heaven's Gate."
  ROS_sustainable_development:0 "Sustainable Development"
  ROS_sustainable_development_desc:0 "While other nations may be content to expand and plow over nature endlessly, we have taken a more restrained approach, limiting the area we use but ensuring every home, every resource, and every community can function almost indefinitely."
  ROS_circuit_study:0 "Circuitry Study"
  ROS_circuit_study_desc:0 "Poseidon Energy left behind a large amount of advanced circuitry, and while we regularly try to recycle it into whatever machines we need, our understanding of how they were made is actually rather poor. Approval has been given to study them so we can manufacture our own and break our reliance on scavenging for vital components."
  ROS_environmental_research:0 "Environmental Research Labs"
  ROS_environmental_research_desc:0 "The EPA has taken control of the old Poseidon Energy labs at Hephaestus, re-opening it to study the natural processes ocurring across Yellowstone. This time, the labs will focus on understanding nature, rather than trying to dominate it."
  ROS_fiscal_policy:0 "Yellowstone's Fincancial System"
  ROS_fiscal_policy_desc:0 ""People ask how Yellowstone can fund all of its projects, from research to conservation, with such a small tax-base. Most attribute it to the ingenious accounting of the EPA, and leave it at that. Truth is they aren't far off, but the Androids at the EPA realized that money was an illusion centuries ago, and every book in the park has been cooked for 200 years, creating and destroying money as needed. It just works.""
  ROS_secret_taxes:0 "Secret Taxes"
  ROS_secret_taxes_desc:0 ""By the EPA's estimates, the Federal government has been slacking off on approving additional funding ever since the "Nuclear War", as if that absolves them of their responsibility to fund their own agencies. The nearby military installation continues to horde its over-inflated budget (typical), and so we will be forced to extract more funding from them ourselves, under the cover of darkness.""
  ROS_sound_theory:0 "A Sounder Theory"
  ROS_sound_theory_desc:0 ""Ha, but no seriously, managing our resources is actually a very important part of conservationism and we need to make sure we aren't demanding more than we can produce. It's time to put our brains to work and start making the books actually work for us if we're ever going to run more than just the park.""
  ROS_civilian_electronics:0 "Civilian Electronics"
  ROS_civilian_electronics_desc:0 ""The lack of consumerism in Yellowstone does make entertaining our people a bit more difficult. Electronics can be taxing to produce, but the Androids of the EPA know a thing or two about maintenance and taking care of their machines. If we could only convince the humans to take care of their things, we could allow them to keep some radios and home terminals for entertainment, so long as they don't start alienating themselves.""
  ROS_nature_channel:0 "The Nature Channel"
  ROS_nature_channel_desc:0 ""Ah, Television. A opiate for the masses, and a potential tool for education and an ideal tool for distributing ideological material. While something as decadant as a TV in every house would be impossible for us to sustain, distributing these devices to community centers to play edutainment documentaries (in Full Chroma-Color!) might help with the humans' morale. Though occaisionally they pick up some... strangely familiar broadcasts.""
  ROS_fluxdrift:0 "Advanced Fluxdrift"
  ROS_fluxdrift_desc:0 ""Fluxdrift is such a wonderful thing. A near-limitless renewable energy source, it has long powered our bodies and auxiliary systems at the EPA. Strangely it seems to react poorly with larger systems - the more stable a system is the harder it is for Fluxdrift to interact with it, making it unviable as the sole power source for our civilization. Still, by applying it in limited capacity we should be able to make most of our industries a bit more sustainable.""
  ROS_transmutation:0 "Flux-Transmutation"
  ROS_transmutation_desc:0 ""A Breakthrough in Flux-manipulation, it seems that by using Poseidon's stable energy systems to power flux-generators, we could push the Flux phenomenon to do more than just power machines...""
  ROS_veggie_burger:0 "The Flux-Burger"
  ROS_veggie_burger_desc:0 ""We break the limits of reality itself and still they demand we let them eat flesh. Fine. We'll give them what they want, or at least something good enough they can't tell the difference...""
  ROS_dogs:0 "Department of Wildlife"
  ROS_dogs_desc:0 "The wildlife of Yellowstone has fared far better than most of the world, thanks in no small part to our careful management and protections. Codifying these practices under the newly reborn Department of Wildlife will gurantee their protections, but has put our use of domestic animals into question."
  ROS_dogs_2:0 "Selective Re-Introduction"
  ROS_dogs_2_desc:0 "Wild Wolves have existed in a limited capacity in Yellowstone for centuries, probably one of the last places on earth they survive unmutated by nuclear fallout. Helping to expand their hunting grounds and repopulate their numbers has often been met with resistance by frightened farmers, but recently people have decided they're okay having dens of highly territorial animals across our border with our northern neighbors..."
  ROS_mutant_animals:0 "Mutant Wildlife?"
  ROS_mutant_animals_desc:0 "The matter of whether Mutant wildlife is subject to the same protections as old world wildlife found in the park has risen in the Department of Wildlife, and they need help deciding what our policy should be."
  ROS_nature_trails:0 "Nature Trails"
  ROS_nature_trails_desc:0 "Without cars, our people are going to need a new way to get around our territory on trips that are too short for rail. A network of nature trails with walkways should enable people to travel moderate distances between villages and ensure our rangers have room to march. Plus, the view and exercise are pretty good for morale."
  ROS_final_preparations:0 "Final Preparations"
  ROS_final_preparations_desc:0 "It's time to finalize our military preperations, setting up emergency factories and defenses, as well as evacuation routes for civilians should our mountain wall crack. Now we'll just have to wait..."
  ROS_restart_grid:0 "Restart The Power Grid"
  ROS_restart_grid_desc:0 "By extending the power lines along our new train routes and making new transformers based on the Poseidon designs, we've been able to establish a new power grid even more effecient than those used before the war! Power is distributed from Hephaestus with secondary generation at most towns as emergency backup should lines go down."
  ROS_signal_towers:0 "Ranger Radio Towers"
  ROS_signal_towers_desc:0 "Some of the few structures allowed in Yellowstone before the ware were radio transmission towers, used for telecommunications and coordinating park rangers. Restoring them and upgrading to function as Ranger watchtowers is essential to restoring the Rangers to their former glory."
  ROS_army_survival:0 "Survival Training"
  ROS_army_survival_desc:0 "The Department of Wildlife recognizes that at times our soldiers may be caught behind enemy lines, and in these compromising situations our soldiers may be tempted to violate EPA regulations on hunting and habitat destruction. To ensure that all regulations are followed all soldiers will be given advanced training on surviving CORRECTLY."
  ROS_poseidon_weapons:0 "The Forbidden Wing"
  ROS_poseidon_weapons_desc:0 "The Hephaestus labs contained a number of other Poseidon Energy projects from the region, including dangerous military prototypes. The blueprints and prototypes have been kept under lock and key since Yellowstone's founding to keep them out of the wrong hands, but for our own survival they could prove a necessary evil."
  ROS_engineering_support:0 "Field Engineers"
  ROS_engineering_support_desc:0 "With the technology recovered from the Vaults, our forces need dedicated tech support more than ever. Luckily, the Ecologists have a wide pool of talent to draw from."
  ROS_athena:0 "ATHENA Armor designs"
  ROS_athena_desc:0 "One of the key designs in the Poseidon Vaults was their experimental ATHENA power armor, supposedly among the best the pre-war world had seen. The schematics here are advanced, too much for our current industrial capacity, and requiring materials we would struggle to reliably produce. Still, the prototypes could see some use in the field, and there's enough equipment here to start manufacturing the most rudimentary of power armor."
  ROS_invasion_begins:0 "The Invasion Begins!"
  ROS_invasion_begins_desc:0 "The invasion has begun! It's time to launch our final battleplans and defend the future of Yellowstone!"
  ROS_survive_invasion:0 "Survive Invasion"
  ROS_survive_invasion_desc:0 "Against all odds, we managed to survive war against a superior enemy, and now find ourself with the task of occupying our new territory"
  ROS_explore_nucleus:0 "Explore The Nucleus"
  ROS_explore_nucleus_desc:0 "The Nucleus, known to the people of Heaven's Gate only as "The Steam", is the heart of their steam-pipe network, and by our measure one of the most advanced fission reactors ever built. While some of the old guard are apprehensive about nuclear power, we have to admit that without the geothermal potential of Yellowstone it's the best option we have to keep the region powered. Lets look into what makes it tick."
  ROS_heal_wounded:0 "Heal Wounded Civilians"
  ROS_heal_wounded_desc:0 "War is destructive, to humanity and the natural world. We have survived the worst of it, but there are many injured soldiers and civilians in need of help. Vindictive as our foes were, we have a moral obligation to help the people of the lands we now occupy and the prisoners of war we captured."
  ROS_restore_order:0 "Restore Order In The Territories"
  ROS_restore_order_desc:0 "Our first concern with the new territories we have to occupy should be ensuring order and stability, preventing further reprisals and uprisings. The zeal that these people cling to, whether nationalist or religious, will take time to cool and we need to prevent further bloodshed."
  ROS_macarthur_base:0 "Investigate Macarthur Airforce Base"
  ROS_macarthur_base_desc:0 "The Macarthur Airforce Base has grown well past its pre-war role into a small city for the Enclave. It seems they tried to scuttle what they could to prevent it from falling into enemy hands, but there's still much to be learned from what we managed to capture here."
  ROS_fallen_chapel:0 "Make Low The Chapel"
  ROS_fallen_chapel_desc:0 "The High Chapel, another group of religious zealots to our west have continually undermined us by sending missionaries and zealots to demand control of the source of their holy river in Yellowstone. Our occupation of Heaven's gate has only infuriated them, believing us to be new trespassers on their holy lands. This situation will require resolution quickly, before it erupts into violence."
  ROS_religious_tolerance:0 "The Matters Of Faith"
  ROS_religious_tolerance_desc:0 "Religion has long taken a secondary role in Yellowstone, with many settlers and tribes maintaining some form of spirituality, often shaped by the Ecologist rhetoric to revere nature and the earth. Our new citizens from Heaven's Gate, however, regard their faith as the most important aspect of their lives, and demand the right to continue their worship as they please. Its time to codify our stance on religion in the nation."
  ROS_forgiving_faith:0 "A Faith of Forgiveness"
  ROS_forgiving_faith_desc:0 "The faith of Heaven's Gate was derived from a strange mixture of Christianity and worship of the Steam powered machines that helped their ancestors rebuild and thrive. We should remind them that deep down theirs is a faith of diligence and redemption, that the best way to serve God is to let go of religious violence and help us build a new paradise on earth."
  ROS_holy_warriors:0 "Holy Warriors"
  ROS_holy_warriors_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, there are still some of The Steam's faithful remain adamant that their their place in God's design is on the battlefield. It could take generations to remove these violent impulses, but if we can't get rid of them we could at least direct them to expeditionary forces to combat the evils of the wasteland."
  ROS_engineer_priests:0 "Engineer Priests"
  ROS_engineer_priests_desc:0 "The priests of Heaven's Gate are responsible for maintaining the great machines of the Nucleus and steam network, as well as the various Steam Core powered devices. Allowing them to train and work alongside our secular engineers could help understand each other's technologies and keep the clergy from becoming as disconnected and powerful as they were under the old theocracy."
  ROS_cathedral:0 "Rebuild the Cathedral"
  ROS_cathedral_desc:0 "With enough of the faithful serving in our ranks, they have gained enough influence to petition for the Republic to help rebuild a ruined cathedral in Heaven's Gate. Building this spiritual center under the grounds of a "cultural building" for them could win over the support of the remaining holdouts to trust our secular government."
  ROS_steam_reborn:0 "Rebirth of The Steam"
  ROS_steam_reborn_desc:0 "The Steam is the name of the city built around the Nucleus, formerly the spiritual and industrial heart of Heaven's Gate. With the largest population in our territory, a defensible location, and a massive fusion reactor it was the ideal location for our new capital. A massive redesign has been drafted to modernize the city into a green new metropolis, a shining city on a hill to show the wasteland that we can not only rebuild, but do so without destroying nature."
  ROS_mechanized_armour:0 "Powered Armour"
  ROS_mechanized_armour_desc:0 "Whether we should use the power armour looted from the Enclave is a controversial topic in Yellowstone. Power armour requires advanced industries and leaves a substantail (literal) footprint when used, and the Enclave who wore it have given it a rather poor reputation, to say the least. Still, it's more energy efficient than tanks and trucks, and if we optimize the reactors with Steam Cores we could make some optimizations to earn EPA approval. Besides, from construction to wrangling deathclaws, we can think of some non-combat uses for these exoskeletons. Let's just study their assembly and start over with effecient designs from the ground up."
  ROS_montana_farmers:0 "Montana Farmers"
  ROS_montana_farmers_desc:0 "Our extensive patrols and rule of Montana have gradually made the people used to our presence, and with the Enclave removed some of the more mutated wastelanders of the region have moved into our territory to settle down. while they still avoid the old Macarthur base out of fear of some other hidden contingency, our slice of Montana is booming into quite the hub of agriculture."
  ROS_win_people:0 "Win the Hearts of the People"
  ROS_win_people_desc:0 "The Macarthur Enclave never fully resolved its internal disputes, between the First Families and the refugees that had settled in the territory the Enclave's rule was never absolute. Winning over the rest of the locals is more important than a handful of scientists or old soldiers, for its in the hearts and minds of the people that we must find the permission to care for this land."
  ROS_enclave_tactics:0 "Enclave Battle Tactics"
  ROS_enclave_tactics_desc:0 "For all their failings the Enclave did have more tactical experience fighting in the wasteland than our Rangers ever accrued. Reading through their training material and after action reports will give us a better sense of what to expect in the wider wasteland, and how to defend ourselves against it."
  ROS_heavy_weaponry:0 "Heavy Weapons Study"
  ROS_heavy_weaponry_desc:0 "The heavy weapons fielded by the Enclave were far more advanced than any we can currently use. Weapons research isn't usually our top priority, but tearing apart a few gatling lasers or incinterators to learn how they tick could help us refine our existing tools to cause less... collateral damage."
  ROS_steambirds:0 "Steambirds"
  ROS_steambirds_desc:0 "Vertibirds were a complicated technology to decipher, but we've finally cracked the secret to their production. Steambirds fitted with new reactors now fly alongside our airships, capable of docking on board for long journeys. A few of the transport models have even been ordered by our firewatch!"
  ROS_steam_armour:0 "Steamknights"
  ROS_steam_armour_desc:0 "Our ground-up redesigns of Power Armour have finally caught up with pre-war performance, even rivaling Enclave APA. With these upgrades our newest divisions, our Steam Knights, will secure the republic as an unmovable lynchpin of the Rockies!"
  ROS_fight_forest_fires:0 "Fight Forest Fires"
  ROS_fight_forest_fires_desc:0 "While allowing natural fires and controlled burns is vital to nature's cycle of renewal, the many fires started by irresponsible use of Enclave energy weapons or Steam Cores exploding is not part of that cycle. We need to start cleaning up the environmental damage these wars have caused."
  ROS_pardon_the_guilty:0 "Pardon The Guilty"
  ROS_pardon_the_guilty_desc:0 "While many members of the Macarthur Enclave chose death on the battlefield or flight back to Chicago, we still captured quite a few members, who are now going on trial to asses their past war crimes against the wasteland. Part of these trials will be determining how remorseful their soldiers and scientists are, with those that have enough morality to admit their wrongdoings given a second chance to join our ranks. Our goal after all is to help rebuild and restore this part of America, not to what it was before, but to something better."
  ROS_quiet_the_storm:0 "Quiet the Storm"
  ROS_quiet_the_storm_desc:0 "The Storm Mongers are just... the worst. We found the Enclave assesments of them and its worse than we thought; Pointless obsession with destructive motors and cars that do nothing but pollute the wasteland, fueled by what they steal as petty raiders. We recognize that trying to wipe out every raider tribe is a task beyond us, but this one in particular, the Ecologists are willing to let slide if it'll shut up that awful rumbling."
  ROS_republic_of_steam:0 "Republic of The Steam"
  ROS_republic_of_steam_desc:0 "Yellowstone hardly feels like a fitting name any more. Depite our best intentions the world has pressured us to expand or die, and we now control lands far beyond the park. Perhaps it's time to reorganize into a new identity, one that can embrace our new people fully. And as we unite the power sources of Heaven's Gate and Yellowstone itself, it's clear exactly what force will drive the engine of progress in our future..."
  ROS_develop_territory:0 "Develop The New Territories"
  ROS_develop_territory_desc:0 "The newest territories of the Republic aren't quite up to the standards of Yellowstone proper, and will need a mix of re-development and environmental cleanup. Sea-Bastion has prepared a list of tasks for us to work on."
  ROS_changing_course:0 "Changing Our Course"
  ROS_changing_course_desc:0 "The shift to a larger nation has brought growing pains and internal dissent about our future, with the old guard worried we're losing sight of our Environmentalist roots, particularly by allowing the destructive industrial practices of our new territories to continue unchecked. Changing over their systems may be unpopular, but it needs to be done, and we could learn a thing or two about efficiency from studying their methods."
  ROS_formalize_army:0 "Formalize the New Army"
  ROS_formalize_army_desc:0 "Our independence was nearly stripped from us because we pursued a policy of minimal violence for years, letting our guard down and turning the Rangers we once depended on into little more than glorified peace officers. War has left scars on our nation, but we must accept that the days of hiding behind our mountains are over. It is time to organize a standing army, so we are never caught off guard again."
  ROS_connect_pipes:0 "Connect Our Pipes"
  ROS_connect_pipes_desc:0 "The steam power of Hephaestus and the Nucleus power two halves of our nation, and it's time to integrate these networks into one national power grid. This will require the creation of a massive underground network of tunnels laid under our planned railway lines, which we have dubbed the "Steamworks""
  ROS_clean_river:0 "Keep the River Clean"
  ROS_clean_river_desc:0 "The old Snake River has seen better days, with the recent religious schism leading to violence and careless exploitation of its banks. Cleaning up the riverway to ensure the pure waters make it to the pacific will slowly help nature rebuild across Washington and Oregon."
  ROS_steamboats:0 "Steamboats"
  ROS_steamboats_desc:0 "With ports on Snake River from Heaven's Gate to Yellowstone itself, it's time we founded a river navy to patrol for illegal activities or enemy movement. We should revive the spirit of the old steamboats and redesign them to cause minimal disturbance to the wildlife in the river. A calm mirelurk is a safe mirelurk."
  ROS_refurbish_airbase:0 "Refurbish Macarthur Airbase"
  ROS_refurbish_airbase_desc:0 "Despite the sabotage and damage caused by the Enclave's final defence, Macarthur's actual airfields remain largely intact. The idea is growing among the Rangers that the most efficient defense against future threats may be achieved through air power, and want to restore the base to a fully airfield. The EPA has approved under stringent emission standards that would limit the number of planes we could deploy. This would limit the air power of other nations, but an old steam engineer from Heaven's Gate has proposed a way to work within these constraints..."
  ROS_airship_development:0 "Airship Development"
  ROS_airship_development_desc:0 "The old steam engineer has revealed his plans: rigid airships. The massive ships he designed are energy efficient enough to operate a large fleet with minimal fuel use. The catch of his proposal is that the designs were never finished before the clergy cancelled his old project, so we'll have to use our labs to finish the designs."
  ROS_distributed_systems:0 "Distributed Power Systems"

Spared the devestation of nuclear detonations, the park would remain a rare oasis of the natural world, and the park rangers and scientists at the park were determined to keep it that way. The Ecologists, a group dedicated to protecting the natural world became the dominant force in the region, keeping peace between the tribes that formed or migrated to the valley and passing on their scientific knowledge to help future generations, while what remained of the Park Rangers became a militia dedicated to protecting us from outside threats."

The nearly limitless power it promised would come at the cost of the geysers and volcanic pools around the park, and the project was protested heavily by environmentalist groups. The Ecologists, many of their members former engineers on the project, decided that the potential to damage Yellowstone's already fragile ecosystem was too severe and had all further research and development halted indefinitely, believing they should instead ration the power it already provided if it would protect the park. Unfortunately for the people of Yellowstone, not everyone in the region shares this noble sentiment..."

Our previous First Ecologist was killed in a skirmish with prostelyizing zealots from the west, forcing the young but driven Sea-Bastion to take up the role. Ranger scouts have reported murmurings among the steam cultists in Heaven's Gate suggesting they learned about Hephaestus, and believe they must reclaim the "ultimate source of steam" in a holy crusade. Even worse, the engineers at Hephaestus noticed that the Poseidonnet uplink had recently been accessed by the Macarthur Airforce Base, and we believe the so-called "Enclave" may be planning to retake it for themselves."

It took a few moments to input the correct commands, and watch the reactor systems lock at their current level. Now that the crisis has been averted, the EPA looks forward to tearing apart what's left of the Enclave's technology. Their most disturbing discovery, however, is that Macarthur is only a detachment of a larger Enclave force in Chicago.

  nf_ros.9.d:0 "The restored Department of Wildlife has brought protections and safety to wild animals across Yellowstone, but some of its members have started raising the question of whether domestic animals should have these same protections or not. A particularly tense debate emerged about dogs, and whether brining them into war is morally acceptable or not. Some of the Ecologists argue that for better or worse dogs are artificial, and their loyalty and skills as trackers make them incredibly helpful in the field. More traditional Rangers are convinced that they may be altered descendents of wolves, but deserve the same respecful protection from violence and that it's unethical to bring them into our warzones. The most extreme proposal was from the EPA, that we distance ourselves too much from animals, and that if we want to recognize them as beings with rights, we should share with them our responsibilities, including military service.

These supercharged lasers can melt through metal armor, including, say, power armor. Unfortunately, these prototypes were never finished, and they have severe reliability and energy drain issues. The other vaults are lined with robots and repeated mentions of a machine called "MONAD", but the only documentation we can find are orders that it be kept on low-power mode indefinitely. The Rangers are opposed to using any of the technologies at all and want us to destroy the records and shut off the power-completely, while the EPA support adopting the Power Packs to survive.

All the old records the Rangers kept document how to manage pre-war wildlife, but gradually mutant creatures from the wasteland are spilling into the Park. brown bears and wolves are now forced to compete with deathclaws and cazadors, while giant geckos and ants harass travelers. The old guard at the EPA wants the Rangers to eliminate these abominations to preserve the old world wildlife, while some of the younger generation regard these creatures as just as much part of nature as any other, and some have even started taming geckos as pets. We could try to maintain balance between the old and new, but allowing some of these invasive species into the park could make life here more dangerous for the regular folk. The department wants guidance on what the official policy should be going forward."

Now that we control Macarthur AFB, we're technically in possession of a great deal of this dangerous technology. Perhaps we should reach out to the regional Chapter and offer to deliver it to them before they try to take it?

A longstanding ally of the National Park Service they once cooperated to ensure that America remained beautiful. But the resource shortages that preceded the great war caused strain between the two, with corruption seeping into the EPA and protections being stripped away to virtually nothing. Even National Parks like the Grand Canyon were turned into industrial developments, and Yellowstone was sold out to Poseidon Energy so they could build Hephaestus. During the days before the bombs fell the EPA and Greenway Hydroponics, a rival of Poseidon, established an outpost to study the effects Hephaestus was having on the Yellowstone Caldera. When the war came, the EPA was quick to enforce its' authority on the people of the park, claiming its position is a legitimate extension of the US government to rule. When they reconnected with Hephaestus they found more resistance than expected, as the Poseidon engineers and the scientists from Greenway Hydroponics that rose to power in the EPA still harbored great resentment. When the Rangers that they had neglected and scorned by dismantling and weakening the park system returned, they refused to let the EPA run the park unopposed, challenging the local director and protecting the will of the people when needed. Yellowstone as it exists now is still partially run by the EPA, who handles much of the day to day governance and law-making, even if they have to contend with rebellious Ecologists and stubborn Park Rangers."

Despite their adversarial relationship, the both groups found common ground in the need to survive the impending nuclear winter, and set to building a community around the facility immediately. When the EPA and Park Rangers managed to reach the facility, a kinship had already been formed and many of the engineers were regretful of their involvement on the project, claiming Hephaestus would have killed them all if it was fully operational. As one of the only permanent structures in the Park, Hephaestus would serve as the de-facto capital around which the three groups would build a future, and gradually the Ecologists would emerge blending the EPA ideals of conservationism and Poseidon's drive to resolve every problem through advanced science. The engineers sealed their old laboratories, locking away the dark history of some of poseidon's most dangerous projects in case they were needed some day. And now, on the eve of an invasion from the north, that time may have come..."

The Rangers left in Yellowstone were fiercely defensive of it, knowing it was one of the last places of unspoiled beauty left... until Poseidon came. Hephaestus was a blight on the landscape and threatened to exploit the geysers that they had spent so long protecting. When the war came and communication with the outside world was lost, the Rangers were initially stubborn about associating with the facility, continuing their jobs in relative isolation. As the reality set in during the first winter, they would turn to Hephaestus, promising to protect the people in exchange for supplies. The EPA would eventually join this tenative alliance, their claims of authority usually ignored by the people when the Rangers saw fit to resist what they still considered a corrupt and spineless organization. Ever since those first years the Park Rangers have continued their duties, conserving the environment and wildlife, protecting the people of the Park, even exploring and keeping tabs on neighboring tribes."

They did all they could to encourage Grozdan to accept the offer, and the word spread rapidly that the people's heroes supported a unified region. \n\n Julius Brandt, on the other hand, was furious at the idea that Grozdan would even entertain this notion, an idea that would see the Wardens bound to the whims of the Rangers that never showed, of the Ecologists that thought they could talk their way out of raiders, of the annoying androids that would rather dictate which calibers of bullets could be used than dare to fire one themselves. \n\n "It's obviously a power play.

Poseidon Energy ran into issues accessing the magma chamber beneath the park, and when it became clear their investment might be wasted, made a secret deal with an unnamed organization, which we now believe to be the Enclave. Poseidon received an atomic device to test underground, and in doing so hoped to open up the flow from the magma chamber and render Yellowstone semi-active so they could tap into it more easily. This detonation also created a strange mineral we now know as "Ultracite", and it was by studying it that they devised the Power Packs and many of the energy systems we use today. Poseidon knew there were dangers in activating Hephaestus without fully understanding the Ultracite deposits, but sent orders to finish the plant anyways. Yellowstone would have almost certainly detonated even worse than it has if they activated it at 100% capacity, something that the Engineers working on the project knew... something that many of our ancestors knew.

  ros_ecologist_legacy_desc:0 "The people of Yellowstone trace their lineage back in part to the rangers and conservationists who cared for the land in the days before the bombs fell. That duty to and respect for the natural splendor around them has not been lost even hundreds of years later. While they no longer understand the world quite as well as they did, they are careful to take only what is needed and to to reuse anything they can to avoid waste."

  ros_secrets_of_the_steam_desc:0 "Our people have always understood that great power and utility lay in the steam and heat that simmer just below the surface of the land, but those belligerents who once brought war to our home understood that power in different and sometimes frightening ways. We can put their research and methods to use, but in ways more suited towards helping rather than harming. Energy to light and warm our homes will make a good start, but there's so much more to learn."

  ros_eco_rangers:0 "The Park Rangers"

  ros_pacifism:0 "Pacifist Traditions"
  ros_pacifism_desc:0 "Yellowstone has existed in relative isolation since the bombs dropped, only needing to fend off the occaisional raider attack or wandering deathclaw.

  ros_volcanic_soils:0 "Volcanic Soil"
  ros_volcanic_soils_desc:0 "The soil in Yellowstone is regularly supplemented with volcanic ash, a byproduct of Hephaestus cracking into the magma under the park. This ash is an excellent fertilizer, and combined with condensed water our farms are the most productive in the northwest."

  ros_autarky_idea_desc:0 "The EPA have adopted a more sustainable practice of regulating and taxing businesses based upon their total resource consumption and usage of specific materials while offering offsets for those who can densify and automate their supply lines.

But not all is well in paradise, as skirmishes with religious zealots and the rapid influx of troops to nearby Macarthur suggest Yellowstone's neighbors may be preparing to take its' greatest secret: The massive Poseidon Energy geothermal project Hephaestus. Hephaestus may provide Yellowstone the chance to survive, and even triumph, but the reckless exploitation of nature is what destroyed the world in the first place, and they would be wise not to make the same mistakes twice..."
