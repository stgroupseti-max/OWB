  warden_legitimacy_explanation_tt:0 "Brandt’s death has caused a crisis, but perhaps an even greater opportunity. Now the Wardens look for a new leader, divided between [VSH.GetName] and [PAS.GetName]. Tensions have already begun to flare, as each side tries to flex their muscles. While they remain small, tensions are likely to grow with war very well being a possibility in the future.  It is crucial that we become the next legitimate leader by any means necessary. Brandt may be dead. \nThe Wardens aren’t."
