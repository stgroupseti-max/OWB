  reh_countess_DESC:0 "Vivienne, enigmatic leader of the 'Binary Counts' Reaver Movement, rose during the chaos of Petra's Run—a brutal year-long power struggle within the Midwestern Brotherhood that severed trade with the western tribes. The resulting famine devastated her flock, driving them to cannibalism and threatening to shatter the tribe. Desperate to save her kindred, Vivienne journeyed east to Chicago, where she encountered the Castareli Family, an insular crime syndicate that safeguarded the sacred traditions of §Rthe Family§!. Under the guidance of the Don, she embraced their teachings, reframing her cannibalism towards the consumption of vitae—blood, a disciplined ritual of faith and restraint.\n\nAdopted officially into the Castareli family, Vivienne spent years among Chicago's glittering elite, reveling in opulence and decadence, cultivating a penchant for silken gowns, exquisite feasts, and the crimson ambrosia that coursed through her chalices.. Yet her soul yearned for her suffering flock. With her Don's blessing, she returned westward to reclaim her kindred, introducing the Family's tenets and transforming their hunger into a sacred communion with the 'current flow,' the divine energy that binds life and technology. Her teachings offered her flock a redemption they didn't see possible.\n\nNow, as both prophet and leader, she leads a campaign into the Plaguelands, seeking sacred technology and open fields for her people. To her kindred, she is a a shepherd, her sanguine sermons stirring reverence and awe. Yet to those beyond her flock, she is a harbinger of dread, a name murmured in hushed tones, one word upon trembling lips: §RVampire§!."

The sin ripped our flesh apart and damned our souls to Satansoft. We have now become the demons we were so afraid of. It is only by our continuing sins that we are allowed to breathe among this tainted land. How could we have been so foolish to listen. Why didn't we see the truth! Why did we follow Father Brin into this cursed land?"
  NTN_leader_name:0 "Kiln Lamore"
  NTN_leader_desc:0 "Kiln Lamore rose to leadership during a time of great strife, when Gravestone launched a Plutonian Crusade against Newton. In the chaos, Kiln's father, a revered Tech-Elder, fell in battle, passing the Sparksplitter to him. This legendary spear, outfitted with pulse emitters to combat the Menace from the West, became both a weapon and a symbol of defiance. With fiery determination and unwavering resolve, Kiln rallied the Reavers, repelling the invaders and securing Newton's independence. His heroism during the Crusade made him a respected figure in Newton, seen as a stalwart defender of his people and their sacred traditions.\n\nAfter securing Newton's survival, Kiln turned his fiery resolve toward rebuilding the Reaver Movement. Those efforts culminated in the creation of the Live Wires Reaver Movement; Kiln performing the first Reaver Dance with the Live Wires in Newton, a sacred ritual that reaffirmed their bond with the divine Current.  With reverent fervor, he hopes he can keep the Binary Counts, Live Wires, and Newton Reaver Movements together - each tribe a node in the divine network."
