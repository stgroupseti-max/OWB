  MOJ_journey_to_the_mojave:0 "Journey to the Mojave"
  MOJ_journey_to_the_mojave_desc:0 "I'd long become troublesome for Lost Hills; figure getting sent here was an effort to be rid of me. Still, my exile served only to enable my pursuits."
  MOJ_children_playing_with_bombs:0 "Like "Children Playing With Bombs""
  MOJ_children_playing_with_bombs_desc:0 "At first, I thought HELIOS One to be ripe for the taking, a veritable treasure trove of technology from before the war. A little slice of the old world all my own. Yet, tiresome children could not still their roaming eyes..."
  moj_power_armor_blueprints:0 "Power Armor Blueprints"
  moj_power_armor_blueprints_desc:0 "When we left for the Mojave, we were given little in the way of equipment. Mostly surplus, or outdated models. Doubt even Lost Hills could have predicted that the NCR would have arrived here before we did.\n\nI ought to make some modifications while there's still time, see if I can make anything worthwhile out of the stock we brought over."
  moj_prep_optimising_helios_one:0 "Optimising HELIOS One"
  moj_prep_optimising_helios_one_desc:0 "NCR took the Dam first, leaving us at a disadvantage in energy production. No matter. A little more time fiddling with HELIOS, and I ought to be able to awaken it just a little more."
  moj_prep_realign_the_panels:0 "Realign Solar Panels"
  moj_prep_realign_the_panels_desc:0 "Old world stupidity got the engineers at Poseidon, just like all the others: forgot to account for the slight alterations in the Earth's orbit after a nuclear exchange.\n\nIdiots. Left me picking up the pieces..."

  moj_prep_overlock_hidden_valley_generators:0 "Overclock Hidden Valley Generators"
  moj_prep_overlock_hidden_valley_generators_desc:0 "I don't have time for renovation work. For the time being, we can directly appropriate Hidden Valley's generators for the purposes of restoring our energy cells."
  moj_prep_work_with_the_gun_runners:0 "Work With the Gun Runners"
  moj_prep_work_with_the_gun_runners_desc:0 "I'm loathe to admit it, but I can extend some respect for the Gun Runners. They're kindred, built something new in a quagmire of stupidity. With Lost Hills' eyes turned away, I could make use of them."
  moj_prep_refurbish_our_stockpile:0 "Refurbish Derelict Stockpile"
  moj_prep_refurbish_our_stockpile_desc:0 "Only one in every ten suits of power armor have working pilot lights.\nOnly one in every twenty of our microfusion cells are fully-charged.\n\nOnly one in fifty of our suits of power armor have fully-functional servos.\nInexcusable! How could this have happened?"
  moj_prep_microfusion_cell_replacement:0 "Microfusion Cell Refurbishing"
  moj_prep_microfusion_cell_replacement_desc:0 "... these aren't microfusion cells, just energy cells painted to look the part. Is this a joke? Was Lost Hills trying to get us killed?"

  moj_prep_heavy_duty_ballistic_barrels_desc:0 "One of my paladins came to me, told me the barrel of their minigun melted off after half a minute of sustained fire. Unbelievable.\n\nNo time to get replacements, need to rectify this myself. Need as much firepower as I can get."
  moj_prep_walking_artillery:0 "Walking Artillery"
  moj_prep_walking_artillery_desc:0 "Day in and day out, I am hounded by naysayers and defeatists going on about perceived tactical disadvantages. Irrelevant! Our paladins are equipped precisely to secure a precious holdout without room to regroup. NCR's logistical advantage won't buy them any recourse against an immovable foe with superior ordinance."
  moj_simulation_training:0 "Simulation Training"
  moj_simulation_training_desc:0 "I detest virtual reality: sits you in a chair, thrusts you into a predictable world. No risk, no variability. Dulls the brain.\n\nStill, with a surplus of unreliable initiates, a deficit of time... no other options. It's an expedience."
  MOJ_preparing_for_sunburst:0 "Testing the Bear"
  MOJ_preparing_for_sunburst_desc:0 "The NCR swarms like ants over Old World relics. Started with the Dam, only a matter of time before their eyes wander to HELIOS.\n\nCan't let them have this. Need to work a little harder, scrape for an advantage."
  MOJ_mysteries_of_helios:0 "That Lucky Old Sun"
  MOJ_mysteries_of_helios_desc:0 "Insolent! Idiotic!\n\nEvery passing hour spent repairing HELIOS One is met with jeers and doubt. McNamara and Hardin I could have foreseen, but Veronica? That even she would doubt me in this critical hour? Inconceivable!\n\nContagious cynicism, no doubt. I'll have to ignore their temptations, keep scraping the sun."
  moj_poseidon_relic_circuitry:0 "Poseidon Relic Circuitry"
  moj_poseidon_relic_circuitry_desc:0 "The treasure of HELIOS One is kept from me by the rotting veins of the station's computers. I'll have to resort to digging through ruins to find replacements."
  moj_assigning_power:0 "Assigning Power"
  moj_assigning_power_desc:0 "HELIOS One is key to a grand design, never realized: HELIOS One was taught to offer its blood to the sky with microwave radiation, pulling spears from the sun."
  moj_petro_chico_military_encryption:0 "Petro Chico Military Encryption"
  moj_petro_chico_military_encryption_desc:0 "Evidently, a small number of engineers from Petro Chico were invited to participate in the development of ARCHIMEDES. The encryption technology looks to be their handiwork: ever-shifting, combatative, like it has a mind of its own.\n\nInfuriating."
  MOJ_spears_from_the_sun:0 "Spears from the Sun"
  MOJ_spears_from_the_sun_desc:0 "I should have guessed. The morons at Poseiden were too stupid to calculate firing coordinates themselves, so they designed a handheld device—the Euclid C-Finder—to do the work for them. Inexplicably, there is no other way of doing this.\n\nThe C-Finder was last seen in the hands of a child. Unsurprising, since it was obviously designed to be used by one."
  MOJ_open_hostility:0 "Tend to Your Business"
  MOJ_open_hostility_desc:0 "Hardin insists I don't bother with trying to crack HELIOS One for the time being. Put it aside, choke the life out of NCR, take it out of the picture for good.\n\nCan hardly bother, but could be useful to hold off on HELIOS, let him do his dirty work; get the important work done when NCR's out of the way.."
  moj_caravan_raids:0 "Caravan Raids"
  moj_caravan_raids_desc:0 "The NCR is dependent on caravans coming through the Long 15 for survival. If we were to slaughter their caravans coming in, what presence NCR has here could wither to ash.\n\nCivilians, mostly. Helpless. Not as if they'll put up a bloody fight."
  moj_searchlight_strike_force:0 "Searchlight Strike Force"
  moj_searchlight_strike_force_desc:0 "From the south, NCR will be reliant on Camp Searchlight. If I were to strike now, we could bleed the Republic out before the conflict starts in earnest."
  moj_van_graff_supply_runs:0 "Van Graff Supply Runs"
  moj_van_graff_supply_runs_desc:0 "NCR is reliant on the Van Graffs to keep supplied with energy weapons: thieves to begin with. What they have belongs to me.\n\nNo harm in repaying their insolence, appropriating whatever is left behind."
  moj_death_and_glory:0 "Death and Glory"
  moj_death_and_glory_desc:0 "When he's out there,—in the wastes,—Hardin can become briefly tolerable. An insufferable liability when he's here, Hardin becomes a useful tool if only somewhere he can keep his mouth shut and get the job done.\nAll the better. Keep him out of my hair."
  moj_accept_veronicas_help:0 "I Could Make You Care"
  moj_accept_veronicas_help_desc:0 "Veronica has suggested that I don't bother with trying to crack HELIOS One for the time being. Her proposal: choke the life out of NCR with other hands.\n\nResourceful. I ought've thought of it."
  moj_ally_with_tabitha:0 "Using the Super Mutants"
  moj_ally_with_tabitha_desc:0 "Veronica told me about a tribe of mutants infesting Black Mountain. Their despot, Tabitha, uses radio transmissions to lure mutants to her upstart nation. Veronica suggests we jam their transmissions, lay the blame on NCR.\n\nDevious. I taught her well."
  moj_work_with_the_bright:0 "Work with the Bright"
  moj_work_with_the_bright_desc:0 "The Brotherhood of Bright, a lunatic cult of ghouls, has taken residence at REPCONN. Conveniently, they are also a self-resolving problem: want to leave this earth, set off on the rockets there.\n\nVeronica suggests that we promise the ghouls our assistance in repairing the rockets if they sabotage NCR. A waste of time, but could reneg when they've outlived their usefulness."
  moj_sway_the_star_chasers:0 "Sway the Star Chasers"
  moj_sway_the_star_chasers_desc:0 "Before the bombs, the Sunset Sarsaparilla corporation promised an unspecified treasure to any moron that could guzzle enough of their product to luck out on getting rare, special bottle caps.\n\nSome still seek the treasure. If we tell them NCR's after the same, the seekers could be made useful."
  moj_support_of_the_mojave:0 "Paladins of the Mojave"
  moj_support_of_the_mojave_desc:0 "Veronica exceeded my expectations as usual. Resourceful as ever, pulling hands from the wasteland like that.\n\nMisguided in trying to follow through, yes, but she grasps this much: get patsies to do your dirty work, and things are bound to work better."
  moj_emergency_ammunition:0 "Emergency Ammunition"
  moj_emergency_ammunition_desc:0 "Running out of ammunition... must be auxiliaries somewhere..."

  moj_the_mojave_secured_desc:0 "It's over.\n\nHELIOS One has gone quiet. What remains? An empty tower. The sun so close you can touch it...\n\n... and a new world on the horizon."
  moj_helios_citadel:0 "The Throne of the Troubled"
  moj_helios_citadel_desc:0 "With the last few thorns dealt with, I finally have time to get to work centralizing things in the Mojave. Best start by finding a place to set up shop for good.\n\nHELIOS One is hardly a defensible location, but I am unwilling to parcel out precious time between studying the station and administration: can't let go now, with my fingers scraping the sun.\nI can make it work."
  moj_neck_of_the_colorado:0 "To Smother the Sea"
  moj_neck_of_the_colorado_desc:0 "With the last few thorns dealt with, I finally have time to get to work centralizing things in the Mojave. Best start by finding a place to set up shop for good.\n\nLost Hills demanded that I fetch them Hoover Dam. No use squandering my efforts elsewhere with all the distractions eliminated. Besides, could get some work done on the turbines if I set up shop right there."
  moj_fortify_hidden_valley:0 "Citadel of the Craven"
  moj_fortify_hidden_valley_desc:0 "With the last few thorns dealt with, I finally have time to get to work centralizing things in the Mojave. Best start by finding a place to set up shop for good.\n\nIt is imperative that we work quietly: can't still the roaming eyes of every petulant hive in the wasteland. Best stay with what works."
  moj_integrating_the_mojave:0 "Integrating the Mojave"
  moj_integrating_the_mojave_desc:0 "The Mojave was easy enough to conquer, securing it is another matter entirely. NCR will return, I'm sure of it. Roaming eyes and grasping hands will need to be kept at bay."
  moj_expand_the_188:0 "Expand the '188"
  moj_expand_the_188_desc:0 "Veronica made a habit of loitering at the '188, gossiping, eavesdropping. Could make use of it for more eyes, secure a bit more presence."
  moj_controlling_nipton_through_fear:0 "Controlling Nipton Through Fear"
  moj_controlling_nipton_through_fear_desc:0 "Joseph Steyn, the mayor of Nipton, came to grovel the second the last NCR boot left Mojave dust.\n\nA coward, stupid to boot. Useful."
  moj_offer_power_for_compliance:0 "Offer Power for Compliance"
  moj_offer_power_for_compliance_desc:0 "HELIOS bleeds surplus, and the Mojave craves. Could parcel out energy by productivity, kill two birds with one stone: keeps them compliant and saves me some labor."
  moj_mandatory_service_for_all:0 "Mandatory Service for All"
  moj_mandatory_service_for_all_desc:0 "Out west, Lost Hills rejects hands from outside. I'm more open-minded. Best demonstrate precisely what they're missing out on.\n\nIt goes this way: enforce servitude, institute a draft. New hands travel to [MOJ.Capital.GetName] and are put to the test, and those found worthy are inducted.\n\nThey're all equally expendable, wherever they dredge them up from."

  moj_rend_the_mojave_dry:0 "Rend the Mojave Dry"
  moj_rend_the_mojave_dry_desc:0 "The Mojave grasps its treasures tight with the grip of the dead. No use holding back now: everything that's useful to me will be taken, pried from the hands of its holders. I've earned my right to take what I please."

  moj_post_sunburst_helios_research:0 "Belated Breach of the Turbulent Tower"
  moj_post_sunburst_helios_research_desc:0 "At long last, no distractions, no preoccupations. I can start on the important work now."

  moj_to_the_great_beyond:0 "To the Great Beyond"
  moj_to_the_great_beyond_desc:0 "I was baffled when Veronica insisted I deliver on the empty promises made at REPCONN. Only when I realized the extent of the ghouls' knowledge of REPCONN's systems did I understand her reasoning.\n\nClever. She never fails to impress me."
  moj_hunt_the_stars_for_the_seekers:0 "Seeking the Severed Stars"
  moj_hunt_the_stars_for_the_seekers_desc:0 "The seekers of the stars proved their use already, but perhaps I could squeeze a little more out of them. If I were to indulge their delusions, I could scrape up whatever they stumble by on their search."
  moj_black_mountain_radio_broadcasts:0 "A False Promise"
  moj_black_mountain_radio_broadcasts_desc:0 "The broadcasts from Utobitha have proven useful as a means of culling the super mutant population.\n\nA beacon, a lure.\n\nSuper mutants seeking refuge will follow the siren's call, find themselves at the foot of the mountain... and go no further."
  moj_elijahs_ambitions:0 "The Serpent's Hunger"
  moj_elijahs_ambitions_desc:0 "Without Lost Hills breathing down my neck, the important work can finally begin. My brothers back home can rot in their stagnancy for all I care: I'm going to cobble together whatever I can out of the detritus the Mojave has left me."
  moj_houses_schematics:0 "What's Left Behind"
  moj_houses_schematics_desc:0 "House's last monument lies empty now, ripe for the plundering. With enough time to shift through the trash, we could dredge up something of use."
  moj_jewel_of_the_mojave:0 "Jewel of the Mojave"
  moj_jewel_of_the_mojave_desc:0 "Hoover Dam and HELIOS; a a good start, yes, but there's other treasures buried under Mojave dust.\n\nThe city of lights, the towers, a deathless despot of the old world sequestered within.\n\nThe time has come. It's over now."
  moj_work_with_benny:0 "Work With Benny"
  moj_work_with_benny_desc:0 "One of House's oligarchs was quick to grovel before new management. Benny, I think his name was. Resourceful. Useful.\n\nHe's gotten lucky. His groveling bought him his life."
  moj_scavenge_vault_21:0 "Scavenge Vault 21"
  moj_scavenge_vault_21_desc:0 "House thought it would be smart to fill up a vault right on the homefront brimming with resources with concrete; reduced it to a hole in the ground, lined with Vault-Tec steel.\n\nIdiot. Now I've got less to work with."
  moj_steward_of_vegas:0 "Steward of Vegas"
  moj_steward_of_vegas_desc:0 "With Vegas secure, we can move forward. I'll let other hands pull the strings there, keep the payoff coming my way.\n\nTurns out Benny was grasping at House's tower before I came along. Reprogrammed one of his robots to run RobCo's systems for him. Competent, but craven, rendered complacent by the promise of luxury.\n\nI could ask for no more."
  moj_enlist_the_families:0 "Enlist the Families"
  moj_enlist_the_families_desc:0 "With Vegas secure, we can move forward. I'll let other hands pull the strings there, keep the payoff coming my way.\n\nHouse had tribals playing dress-up, gave me an easy out. Competent enough to govern, too stupid to stab me in the back. I could keep them fighting over scraps while I suck them dry."
  moj_houses_ultimate_treasure:0 "Houses Ultimate Treasure"
  moj_houses_ultimate_treasure_desc:0 "Right when I pulled House out of his tower, he was searching for an upgrade to his software: an ace in the hole, sealed in a platinum chip.\n\nHouse already found it, sent out for a courier to deliver it, so the chip made its way back to Vegas. Back to me.\n\nThe bulk of it was useless, only meant for securitrons, but some value could still be scrounged up."

  moj_preparing_against_the_legion:0 "Preparing Against the Legion"
  moj_preparing_against_the_legion_desc:0 "Stupid! Stupid, all of them!\n\nThe morons Lost Hills gave me can't keep up with the Legion. They'll break their divisions, but the Legion regroups before any real damage is done. Two millennia of tactical and technological development on them, and nothing comes of it.\n\nNeed to make it work. I've come too far for the wasteland to do me in."
  moj_reserve_power_in_archimedes:0 "Reserve Power in ARCHIMEDES"
  moj_reserve_power_in_archimedes_desc:0 "Legion's pragmatic, throwing bodies at the problem until it disappears. May be prudent to reserve power from HELIOS to keep ARCHIMEDES fed. Keep HELIOS' blood, then let it go to drown them all."
  moj_rescue_legion_slaves:0 "Rescue Legion Slaves"
  moj_rescue_legion_slaves_desc:0 "Slavery is a system that works: gets results, even for your average wasteland dolt. No wonder the Legion is so reliant on it.\n\nInefficient with them, the Legion will be entirely helpless without them. Ingratiates me to the slaves, too: they'll help us more than they ever did them. Get two birds with one stone."
  moj_fortifying_the_dam:0 "Fortifying the Dam"
  moj_fortifying_the_dam_desc:0 "The Dam is our bulwark: defensible, a shining meat grinder for the Legion to leap into. With some preparation, it could swallow them in whole."
  moj_smelt_down_legion_currency:0 "Smelt Down Legion Currency"
  moj_smelt_down_legion_currency_desc:0 "Incompetent! Inexcusable! The Legion has been sitting on gold,—conducive, pleading to course with life!—and minting it for coin? Such a waste. We'll put it to better use."
  moj_reward_veterans_of_the_legion_campaign:0 "Rewarding Veterans of the Legion Campaign"
  moj_reward_veterans_of_the_legion_campaign_desc:0 "Medals. Accomadations. Accolades. Wasteful monuments to sentimentality.\n\nBut convenient. Gets people complacent, doesn't waste my time long."
  moj_soldiers_of_helios:0 "Soldiers of Helios"
  moj_soldiers_of_helios_desc:0 "Through fire and war, my paladins held firm against the Legion. Stories have started to circulate across the wasteland. If it can be useful to me,—if it can foster admiration,—why not feed the spread?"

  moj_repconn_development:0 "REPCONN Development"
  moj_repconn_development_desc:0 "Rocketry is a lost art. Can't import fuel or metal, smothers any work in its crib because of the scarcity. Still, I am lucky to have happened on REPCONN. With the knowledge and treasure left there, and a little bit of careful stockpiling, we could dredge something up."
  moj_study_primm_slimm:0 "Study Primm Slim"
  moj_study_primm_slimm_desc:0 "Of all places, I found something useful in Primm: a robot called Primm Slim, a custodian for a tomb to Old World criminals. Robots with intact personalities have always had something to pick out of their databanks; if we let the ghost ramble, we might get a useful tidbit out of it."
  moj_follow_the_navarro_survivors:0 "Who Clutches at Old Crowns"
  moj_follow_the_navarro_survivors_desc:0 "Hardin's come to me with some nonsense about Old World devils walking the wasteland, crying out for vengeance.\n\nImplausible, but inauspicious. An inconvenience waiting to happen. Should go on the hunt, seek the last gasp of the Old World kingmakers."
  moj_the_cipher_expedition:0 "Walk With the Ciphers"
  moj_the_cipher_expedition_desc:0 "Far beyond the Mojave, there are other little tidbits that have caught my interest. The Ciphers, for instance: a tribe of the West clinging to the tomes and schemata of the Old World: documents scarcely understood by their keepers, but treasured.\n\nAn expedition could be of some value, give us both something to think about."

  moj_study_our_enemies:0 "To Know the Ghosts"
  moj_study_our_enemies_desc:0 "The legends and stories of the Sierra Madre are disjointed, riddled with contradictions between them. One constant is that the Sierra Madre is a city of ghosts, and of groveling guardians.\n\nKeep severing my hands. Gets tiresome. Some field study is in order."
  moj_study_the_cloud:0 "To Know the Cloud"
  moj_study_the_cloud_desc:0 "The legends and stories of the Sierra Madre are disjoined, riddled with contradictions between them. One constant is the talk of a blood-red cloud over the city: a guardian miasma that chokes the life of whatever wanders into its grasp.\n\nThe applications are inspiring."
  moj_design_cloud_walker_power_armor:0 "To Walk the Cloud"
  moj_design_cloud_walker_power_armor_desc:0 "The ghost people of the Sierra Madre haven't rotted away entirely on account of their suits, but they couldn't keep the Cloud out altogether: sept in, decayed them from the inside but stopped just short of killing them. The underlying design flaws in their suits could be used as a counter-example to drive my own work, give me an idea what I could use to seal our power armor from the Cloud."
  moj_brotherhood_teams:0 "The Sacrifice of Ours"
  moj_brotherhood_teams_desc:0 "Inexplicably, the opening of the Sierra Madre—sealed since the war—is tied directly to the preceding Gala Event; cracking it takes many hands in different positions.\n\nKicking off the Gala Event with Brotherhood manpower will carry a grave cost, but I've can't gamble on wastrel stupidity."
  moj_wastelander_teams:0 "The Sacrifice of Others"
  moj_wastelander_teams_desc:0 "Inexplicably, the opening of the Sierra Madre—sealed since the war—is tied directly to the preceding Gala Event; cracking it takes many hands in different positions.\n\nMy bothersome brothers wallow in greed, and greed feeds the seeds of revolt.\nThey'd turn on me, doubtless. I've got to rely on other hands to kick off the Gala Event.\nNo disloyalty can triumph smothered by wastrel stupidity."

  moj_harness_the_cloud:0 "Sun-Blotting Bleeding Pneuma"
  moj_harness_the_cloud_desc:0 "The applications of the Cloud are inspiring: a weapon unlike any other. Rust-bleeding pneuma, swallowing the sun.\n\nCould wipe the slate clean, should it be cast out into the wastes.\n\nIt's tempting.

  MOJ_our_founding:0 "Our Founding"
  MOJ_our_founding_desc:0 "While High Elder Maxson was the founder of the Brotherhood as a whole, each chapter has had its own founders, those that spread the word of the dangers of technology farther into the Wasteland. Who were our founders?"

  moj_needs_to_be_secured:0 "§RThis individual region needs to be secured before we can take this focus.§!"
  MOJ_our_interim:0 "Our Interim"
  MOJ_our_interim_desc:0 "Each chapter of the Brotherhood has its own priorities. Some focus on collecting the powerful weapons of the Old World, while some prioritise the industrial machinery and tools. What did we focus on?"

  MOJ_our_future:0 "Our Future"
  MOJ_our_future_desc:0 "We have learned plenty in the years that are now behind us. We must now use that experience and make preparations for the many years that are in front of us."

  MOJ_water_operations:0 "Water Operations"
  MOJ_water_operations_desc:0 "With secure access to a large body of water, we can begin to expand our operations to a naval theatre. Although we have little to no experience in such matters, we can look to pre-war tactics for guidance."

  MOJ_port_expansion:0 "Port Expansion"
  MOJ_port_expansion_desc:0 "In order to host a fleet of operational size we require numerous facilities, such as dry docks, maintenance yards, piers, etc. In order to accomplish our goals we'll need to invest heavily in the expansion of our existing naval infrastructure."

  MOJ_supporting_vessels:0 "Sea Raiders"
  MOJ_supporting_vessels_desc:0 "Smaller and lighter craft make up the bulk of modern wasteland navies. To keep our edge in the seas we must invest in the production of simple, robust crafts, who can harass enemy vessels with ease."

  MOJ_larger_vessels:0 "Siege Ships"
  MOJ_larger_vessels_desc:0 "In order to make any kind of dent in an enemy navy, and to effectively support our troops on the shore, we need to be capable of building large ships capable of mounting large weaponry. Focusing on this will bring us closer to naval domination."

  MOJ_reclaim_a_flagship:0 "Reclaim a Flagship"
  MOJ_reclaim_a_flagship_desc:0 "Power projection is everything. In order to truly make our mark on the seas we cannot simply have an effective navy: we must also have an impressive one. A refitted flagship of the Old World would suit our needs nicely."

  MOJ_aerial_operations:0 "Aerial Operations"
  MOJ_aerial_operations_desc:0 "Flexibility is something our organisation often lacks. In order to account for our weaknesses we must turn them into strengths. In the past, vast expeditions have been undertaken with the aid of aerial equipment. We can learn from this."

  MOJ_from_the_skies:0 "From The Skies"
  MOJ_from_the_skies_desc:0 "Although we possess the knowledge to retrofit the most basic of aircraft, we have no knowledge on how to pilot them in combat, or how to utilise them tactically. We should turn to our databases and adapt as much information on pre-war air tactics as we can."

  MOJ_staging_bases:0 "Staging Bases"
  MOJ_staging_bases_desc:0 "Aircraft are oversized paperweights without the proper facilities to maintain and arm them, and enough open space to take off and land. If we want to develop an effective air force we need to scout for ideal locations to create airfields, and do just that."

  MOJ_aerial_supremacy:0 "Aerial Supremacy"
  MOJ_aerial_supremacy_desc:0 "With our newfound understanding of ariel combat, we can begin to redesign our planes with the wasteland in mind. Cutting corners where possible will save us a lot of production time and valuable resources, both of which are things in scarce supply currently."

  MOJ_flight_academy:0 "Brotherhood Flight Academy"
  MOJ_flight_academy_desc:0 "Pilots are the lifeblood of an air force, and our pilots need to make effective use of our limited supply of planes, ammunition, and equipment. Establishing a thorough training programme for pilots will not only make better use of our equipment, but it may provide us with a genuine ace."

  MOJ_our_right:0 "Our Right"
  MOJ_our_right_desc:0 "As a technocratic organisation, every piece of tech is rightfully ours. We do not steal technology out of malice or spite, we take it away to protect the innocents who will inevitably misuse it. Although people don't always understand, everything we do is ultimately to keep the wasteland safe. Our understanding of technology is second to none."

  MOJ_salvaged_metal:0 "Salvaged Metal"
  MOJ_salvaged_metal_desc:0 "Metal salvage is easy to come by. Twisted scraps of metal are as common as dirt in the wasteland, protruding from buildings, buried in the Earth like weeds, and strewn across streets like rubbish. Salvaging the metal in our immediate area will provide us with more resources for our equipment."

  MOJ_increase_power_production:0 "Increase Power Production"
  MOJ_increase_power_production_desc:0 "Generators are both a blessing and a curse. They create large amounts of power for relatively low maintenance cost, but they often require specific fuel cells and are difficult to redesign to run off of corn fuel. Investing in power generation will always benefit our equipment output."

  MOJ_salvaged_electronics:0 "Salvaged Electronics"
  MOJ_salvaged_electronics_desc:0 "Salvaging electronics is much more difficult than salvaging metal, in part due to the delicate nature of most electronics. At best, pulling the wiring and circuitry from radios, robots, and broken energy weapons will provide us with more scrap electronics for future projects."

  MOJ_advanced_tech:0 "Advanced Tech"
  MOJ_advanced_tech_desc:0 "Gathering rare technology is not only difficult, but dangerous. Often, the locations where rare pre-war technology can be found are also filled with killer robots, deadly radiation, or other hazards. Still, gathering advanced tech will allow us to create numerous high-end pieces of equipment, so it must be done."

  MOJ_fueling_our_rise:0 "Fuelling Our Rise"
  MOJ_fueling_our_rise_desc:0 "Fuel comes in all forms, but often our scavenging parties search for the nuclear variety. Unspent fuel cells are incredibly valuable to everyone in the wasteland, but especially to us. They power our power armour, our gatling lasers, and our generators. Securing them is a high priority for all scouts."

  MOJ_arm_foundries:0 "Arms Foundries"
  MOJ_arm_foundries_desc:0 "We cannot spread and uphold our doctrine without force, and we cannot apply force effectively if our men are undersupplied. If the Brotherhood is to continue its operations, we must not only take technology from the hands of settlers, but produce it ourselves."

  MOJ_civilian_workshops:0 "Civilian Workshops"
  MOJ_civilian_workshops_desc:0 "Many of the bunkers and bases we seek to occupy were not left untouched by the Great War, and they require extensive repairs and excavation efforts to become fully usable. To ensure that we're prepared for future construction efforts, we should begin to develop a small industrial base of our own."

  MOJ_heavy_production:0 "Heavy Production"
  MOJ_heavy_production_desc:0 "With our civilian and military industry projects finished we're seeing our efforts pay off hand over fist. In order to continue to foster success and fuel our growth, we should launch a second, smaller construction effort, focusing on a mixture of both branches. Alongside this, we can set up infrastructure for future efforts, also."

  MOJ_our_might:0 "Our Might"
  MOJ_our_might_desc:0 "The Brotherhood of Steel is feared and respected throughout the wasteland for our military might. In terms of combat effectiveness, we are high above the dregs the wasteland has to offer. One man in power armour is worth ten unarmoured soldiers, if not more. Studying previous engagements will help us improve our future combat doctrine."

  MOJ_steel_legions:0 "Steel Legions"
  MOJ_steel_legions_desc:0 "Standing side by side our men form a wall of unbreakable strength. The Brotherhood is like one long chain, spread out across the continent, with many, many links throughout its length. No part of the Brotherhood is weak, every man and woman is trained to a level of proficiency other groups can only dream of."

  MOJ_new_initiates:0 "New Initiates"
  MOJ_new_initiates_desc:0 "We're more than just a military organisation, the Brotherhood is one large family. Our knights, paladins, and scribes are all free to pursue relationships, marry, and have children. This is how the Brotherhood survives. When these children come of age, they become initiates, and start their training for their respective discipline."

  MOJ_t45d_production:0 "T-45d Production"
  MOJ_t45d_production_desc:0 "T-45d was the first model of power armour produced by America, and it shows. A simple frame, lacklustre servos, exposed weak points and a less than impressive helmet design. Still, any power armour is better than none, and its simplicity makes it faster to fix and produce."

  MOJ_t51b_production:0 "T-51b Production"
  MOJ_t51b_production_desc:0 "The pinnacle of pre-war power armour design, the T-51b model is a favourite among the Brotherhood of Steel for its robust design, shaped ceramic armour, lack of clear weak points, and expertly crafted helmet and filters. Although harder to maintain and produce, there's no doubt that T-51b is superior to T-45d in every way."

  MOJ_wastelander_conscripts:0 "Wastelander Conscripts"
  MOJ_wastelander_conscripts_desc:0 "Wastelanders are a dime a dozen, with little special or unique about them. Often short sighted, brutish, and too simple to understand the danger of technology: we often avoid them like the plague. Still, sometimes, new blood is required. At times like these, we hunt the population for worthy candidates, often accepting proven and friendly wastelanders into our ranks."

  MOJ_flesh_before_steel:0 "Flesh Before Steel"
  MOJ_flesh_before_steel_desc:0 "\"The flesh is weak,\" a common phrase with a vastly different meaning to others than to us. In the Brotherhood, this phrase is said to express and accept that the human body is frail. Even with our power armour we are still human, and unless the body inside the armour has been trained properly, it will die off long before the armour breaks. All initiates are trained to understand this: weakness is human."

  MOJ_basic_arms_for_basic_people:0 "Basic Arms for Basic People"
  MOJ_basic_arms_for_basic_people_desc:0 "Even wastelanders recruited into our ranks cannot be expected to understand technology as well as we do. In order to prevent any unfortunate accidents, we provide wasteland recruits with simpler energy weapons until they've proven themselves capable. Naturally, this means we produce and salvage many weapons ahead of time for new recruits."

  MOJ_doctrinal_thought:0 "Doctrinal Thought"
  MOJ_doctrinal_thought_desc:0 "With new blood comes new ideas. Wastelanders think and fight a different way to the Brotherhood, and this experience often proves valuable for the Brotherhood as a whole. By making our wasteland initiates compose reports of their previous battles, we can examine them to gauge the state of the wasteland, and prepare accordingly."

  MOJ_combined_operations:0 "Combined Operations"
  MOJ_combined_operations_desc:0 "Learning to fight alongside former wastelanders can be difficult. Their wild, survivalist minded style of combat can often be hectic and unpredictable. This is precisely why recruiting them can be so valuable, and why fitting them into our command structure is so beneficial. That wild, unpredictable nature only makes our squads more effective than before."

  MOJ_our_goal:0 "Our Goal"
  MOJ_our_goal_desc:0 "The Brotherhood's ideology is straight forward. We desire a world in which the recklessness of man cannot be enabled by the tools he wields, a world in which atrocities aren't committed for the sake of \"scientific progress.\" This is why we confiscate technology, and destroy that which we cannot confiscate. All of our duties are for the good of mankind as a whole."

  MOJ_seek_technology:0 "Cracking Open the Robots"
  MOJ_seek_technology_desc:0 "Plenty of old robots shamble about the Mojave, pathetically aimless. They've got little use to wastrel prospectors other than scrap metal, but they could be of more substantial use to someone of any talent. I could start cracking what's left open, see what I can figure about how to iterate on their designs."

  MOJ_scribe_research:0 "Wrangling the Braincases"
  MOJ_scribe_research_desc:0 "Without the obstructionists at Lost Hills breathing down my neck, I've got the opportunity to start getting something of value done; get those idiot savant braincases they gave me working on mass-producing some of what I cobbled together from what we dug up."

  MOJ_old_developments:0 "Old Developments"
  MOJ_old_developments_desc:0 "Pre-war technology is inherently valuable, even if it's broken and only pure scrap. Scouring pre-war ruins for undiscovered rare technology, whether broken or somewhat working, is an important part of the Brotherhood's operations in the wasteland."

  MOJ_robotic_advancements:0 "Robotic Advancements"
  MOJ_robotic_advancements_desc:0 "Robotics was one of America's largest industries before the Great War, and it was considered a world leader in the field of robotics. As a result of this the wasteland is scattered with the shells of broken robots, as well as the roaming figures of those still following outdated programming. Taking both apart will aid us in building robots for our own ends."

  MOJ_vertibird_schematics:0 "Vertibird Schematics"
  MOJ_vertibird_schematics_desc:0 "The most prized of all pre-war schematics, the schematics for Vertibirds are rare and difficult to come across. All known copies have only ever come from the Enclave, and with their demise this precious supply has dried up. Still, former Enclave technicians who escaped their demise often take many tools with them... and sometimes, a schematic or two."

  MOJ_bunker_thought:0 "Bunker Mindset"
  MOJ_bunker_thought_desc:0 "Almost all members of the Brotherhood were born in a bunker, and most of us spent our lives growing up in and around them. For us, the safety of a bunker is reassuring and comforting. As a result, Brotherhood fortifications are built to a higher standard than most others, due to our familiarity with reinforced structures."

  MOJ_surface_outposts:0 "Surface Outposts"
  MOJ_surface_outposts_desc:0 "In order to expand our operations farther and farther, we require secure facilities to store supplies and rest between expeditions. Establishing a construction corps specifically for the purpose of building surface fortifications would benefit us greatly."

  MOJ_underground_workshops:0 "Underground Workshops"
  MOJ_underground_workshops_desc:0 "Expanding our industrial base inside of our bunker network is our next priority. Setting up industry within fortified positions will allow us to continue to create a respectable output even while on the back foot, effectively creating a layer of industry that our enemy cannot take until the very end."

  MOJ_new_technology:0 "Technological Breakthrough"
  MOJ_new_technology_desc:0 "Our scribes have made a series of significant scientific discoveries in rapid succession, broadening our horizons and impacting all of our current research projects from the ground up. This is truly incredible, as these teachings will allow us to pursue our research and restoration projects faster than ever before."

  MOJ_tesla_theory:0 "Tesla Theory"
  MOJ_tesla_theory_desc:0 "With our new breakthroughs in the field of science, our scribes have been able to recreate a pre-war schematic we found long ago. Formerly, we were incapable of reproducing its effects without disastrous results. Now, however, we've finally managed to stabilise the design enough for combat use. Tesla weaponry has been added to our armouries!"

 # Mojave Chapter #

  MOJ_chapter_leadership:0 "Chapter Leadership"
  MOJ_chapter_leadership_desc:0 "Within the innermost part of Hidden Valley, a great debate is taking place between Elijah and McNamara over the future of the Mojave Chapter itself. The core of the debate is centred around Elijah's obsession with the Old World, and how it negatively impacts the chapter. The outcome of the debate remains uncertain."

  MOJ_elijah:0 "Elijah"
  MOJ_elijah_desc:0 "After the debate, Elijah managed to retain control of his chapter, even with tensions still high. However, seeing his determination to follow his ambitions has created as much awe as ire, and his position remains absolute. Elijah is the undisputed leader of the Mojave Chapter."

  MOJ_scribal_thought:0 "Scribal Thought"
  MOJ_scribal_thought_desc:0 "Without the obstructionists at Lost Hills breathing down my neck, I can get to work on preparing the Brotherhood for its future. Plenty of scribes that came with me because the Brotherhood wanted to get rid of them; competent enough to use."

  MOJ_old_world_rumours:0 "The City of the Dead"
  MOJ_old_world_rumours_desc:0 "We've all heard about the Sierra Madre casino. The legends, the curses. Foolishness about a shining monument in the middle of a city of the dead, luring treasure hunters to their doom.\n\nI saw the records from the Big Empty, the transactions. There's no doubt that this is where the final treasure was sent. The time has come for the Sierra Madre to be cracked open.\n\nNo matter the cost."

  MOJ_helios_one:0 "Retaking Helios One"
  MOJ_helios_one_desc:0 "The NCR has robbed us of Helios One, a key part of Elijah's greater ambitions. Its energy output is essential to the future of the chapter itself, and Elijah insists that there's more to the facility than meets the eye. Whether or not his delusions will prove true, the fact remains that we cannot allow the NCR to control such advanced and dangerous technology."

  MOJ_energy_boom:0 "Energy Boom"
  MOJ_energy_boom_desc:0 "Helios One is a miracle of pre-war science, highly advanced even for its day, and completely irreplaceable in the modern wasteland. Elijah, however, is undaunted by these issues facing him. His mind works in mysterious ways, and he's assured us that he will be able to repair the facility, given time. Considering the output has recently increased, he might just be worth believing."

  MOJ_sierra_madre:0 "Sierra Madre"
  MOJ_sierra_madre_desc:0 "An invitation left unanswered for 200 years calls the wasteland to a grand opening unlike any other, where friends and freedom await. You can begin again, the sultry voice promises, and who doesn't want that? Many a desperate fool has followed that forgotten voice, and now, the Brotherhood is going to do the same."

  MOJ_a_forgotten_hellscape:0 "A Forgotten Hellscape"
  MOJ_a_forgotten_hellscape_desc:0 "The air smells like Old World gold, rust, and blood. The Sierra Madre has all of these in spades, indeed, its streets are lined with gold, choked by rust, and slick with blood. The rumours were all true, this is paradise on Earth: but a nuclear holocaust, 200 years of neglect, a parasitic cloud that devours men in their armour, and mysterious ghost people have turned it into a forgotten Hellscape."

  MOJ_what_remains:0 "What Remains"
  MOJ_what_remains_desc:0 "Death incarnate: that is the Sierra Madre's true form. In a place filled with nothing but death and despair, little remains, but those few dregs are like liquid starlight. Unkillable men who stalk the heart of the casino and vending machines capable of making something from almost nothing: these are the gifts left to us by the ghosts of the Sierra Madre."

  MOJ_a_forgotten_weapon:0 "A Forgotten Weapon"
  MOJ_a_forgotten_weapon_desc:0 "Elijah's promises have come true. Even after his genius brought Helios One back to a quarter of its total output, we were sceptical of his claims. Today, however, we were proven deeply wrong in our estimation of his promise. White light that splits the sky with a scream, leaving nothing but charred remains in its wake: this is the weapon Elijah has delivered to us."

  MOJ_hardin:0 "Hardin"
  MOJ_hardin_desc:0 "Hardin has emerged the victor of the debate, although he wielded a weapon instead of words. Standing tall over Elijah's still warm ashes in the gloom of that bunker, McNamara simply stood aside and let Hardin have his way. For better or worse, this West Coast loyalist now leads the Mojave Chapter."

  MOJ_paladin_thought:0 "Paladin Thought"
  MOJ_paladin_thought_desc:0 "Hardin is a true believer in the doctrine put forward by the Western Brotherhood, having been somewhat loathe to leave the heart of the Brotherhood behind. With his newfound power as the Elder of the Mojave Chapter, Hardin will focus on what he knows best: combat."

  MOJ_know_our_name:0 "Know Our Name"
  MOJ_know_our_name_desc:0 "For too long the Brotherhood has been considered weak by the population of the Mojave. They do not talk of us in hushed tones anymore, rather, they speak openly about how free of our influence they are. They call us \"tin cans\" and joke about our doctrine of tech reclamation. No longer! Soon, the day of reckoning will come for the Mojave, and they will know our name."

  moj_follow_the_navarro_survivors_tt:0 "§gWe begin supplying a small group of paladins to begin searching Mt. Charleston in the hopes of finding the bunker of "Devil's Brigade", a Navarro Remnants cell. This operation will be particularly expensive - needing us to supply them with ammunition and munitions for the duration of their mission.§!"

  MOJ_closedown_van_graffs:0 "Close Down Van Graffs"
  MOJ_closedown_van_graffs_desc:0 "The Van Graff family is well known throughout California, their name is often whispered in seedy bars and back alleys. Their influence throughout Redding and North California is immense, but it wanes the farther away you go. It's time to teach the Van Graffs a stern lesson: selling pre-war tech in Brotherhood territory drastically shortens your lifespan."

  MOJ_gun_runner_caravan_raids:0 "Gun Runners Caravan Raids"
  MOJ_gun_runner_caravan_raids_desc:0 "The Gun Runners are one of the only organisations in the post-war that can be considered master craftsmen. Working off of tightly guarded pre-war gun schematics, the Gun Runners produce and sell top of the line weapons for a high price. Their operations in the Mojave aren't nearly as well guarded as they should be, and killing is easier than scavenging..."

  MOJ_ncr_raids:0 "NCR Raids"
  MOJ_ncr_raids_desc:0 "The NCR disgraced the Brotherhood decades ago. They've never been friendly towards the Mojave Chapter, often firing upon our patrols, and now the time has come to repay them for their lack of hospitality. Mojave Outpost will be left in ruins, Camp Golf will burn. This is what happens when you fuck with the Brotherhood."

  MOJ_contact_the_west:0 "Contact The West"
  MOJ_contact_the_west_desc:0 "Finally the day has come for the Mojave Chapter to reunite with the Western Brotherhood. Hardin's campaign of death and destruction has seen many spoils transferred to Hidden Valley's armoury, and his results are sure to please the West. Now all we can do is wait to hear back from him."

  MOJ_aggressive_policy:0 "Aggressive Policy"
  MOJ_aggressive_policy_desc:0 "Shoot first and ask questions later: that's what Hardin has drilled into the minds of his soldiers. The Mojave Chapter is hanging on by a thread, surrounded by enemies, it simply cannot afford mercy any longer. In Hardin's quest to scorch the Mojave with laser burns, kindness and mercy are relics of the past. All that matters is whether you can shoot straight, and how high your daily kill-count is."

  MOJ_mcnamara:0 "McNamara"
  MOJ_mcnamara_desc:0 "With control wrested from Elijah, McNamara had a hard road ahead of him. Lacking the support of the West, and with the NCR and Legion both heading on an impact course centred on the Mojave, The Mojave Brotherhood needed to open up to the world at large."

  MOJ_progressive_thought:0 "Progressive Thought"
  MOJ_progressive_thought_desc:0 "Opening our doors to the Mojave also means opening our doors to the troubles of the wastes. Not only that, but the emergence of a highly militarized, power armour wearing warriors makes the locals nervous and distrustful of us. A possible solution would be to arm and train local peacekeeping and militia forces in the lands under our protection, bringing them into the fold."

  MOJ_the_future:0 "The Future"
  MOJ_the_future_desc:0 "The future of the Mojave Chapter hangs in the balance. Elder McNamara plans on enacting a twofold plan to ensure our continued existence. First, we must ally ourselves with the NCR, through treaties or self annexation. Secondly, we will pledge ourself to the cause of helping the Mojave's scattered settlements."

  MOJ_ncr_negotiations:0 "NCR Negotiations"
  MOJ_ncr_negotiations_desc:0 "Our first step in achieving peace in the Mojave is guaranteeing the safe passage of both of our nations' troops in the Mojave. To that end we have prepared a message to send the NCR, proposing that they be allowed to patrol our lands in exchange for possible mutual support in the future."

  MOJ_ncr_trade:0 "NCR Trade"

  MOJ_help_the_needy:0 "Help The Needy"
  MOJ_help_the_needy_desc:0 "Our superior technology could be used to great effect improving the state of medical care within the Mojave. Even just the reintroduction of proper pre-natal care and childbirthing practices will make a huge impact in yearly population numbers. Proper medical facilities will also allow us to build rapport with the denizens of the wastes."

  MOJ_incorporate_the_followers:0 "Incorporate The Followers"
  MOJ_incorporate_the_followers_desc:0 "Several of our clinics have been visited by members of the Followers of the Apocalypse. While we are more militant than them, we share a common goal of improving the Mojave, and their extensive expertise will greatly improve our research efforts.
