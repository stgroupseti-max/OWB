EXE_CHIEF_EXECUTIVE_MCKINLEY_NAME: ""Chief" Executive McKinley"
EXE_CHIEF_EXECUTIVE_MCKINLEY_DESC: "The newest CEO of Vault-Tec, known to her subordinates as Chief Executive, McKinley won her position during the annual “Hostile Takeover” in 2271, and has retained it since. Utilising advanced technology and research carried out of the Corporate Vault, McKinley has spearheaded a number of “buyouts” in New Mexico, expanding the Vault-Tec family of “franchised communities.” Even if she'd rather have just killed them all and looted their corpses.\n\nAs the CEO, McKinley has been forced to give up her varied hobbies in pursuit of higher profit margins and monthly growth. Painting walls with entrails, shooting jet, riding shotgun in raids- she can do none of it now. In return however, she can do something no one else can: begin new Vault experiments, just for fun!"
EXE_CHIEF_EXECUTIVE_MCKINLEY_SECOND_DESC:0 "McKinley has over the last several years had immense success as the CEO of the Executives, enough so that the group has outgrown not just their home in exile but even what they had in the corporate vault. In recognition of the company's rise from the ashes, a more traditional corporate structure has been revived. Gone are the hostile takeovers where McKinley would beat her challengers to death, gone is the supremacy of security staff over the other divisions. She has now become a legend in the company and will go down in history as the woman who brought Vault-tec back from the dead.\n\nUnfortunately for her, as her respectability goes up so does her responsibilities. Meetings with the board, actual audits, acting semi-professional, it's only become harder for her to find some time for fun. Instead she must settle for pride in what she's created, the admiration of her staff, and the comfort of a vault-shine lunch. She is still however a very dangerous woman, and anyone getting on Vault-Tec's bad side will learn that quickly enough."

She is a driven and passionate woman, dedicated to scientific principles and advancing the Vault-Tec legacy of experimental brilliance. All that is to say she takes her job seriously and often butts heads with CEO McKinley over the details and procedures of research. It is not to say that she is a soft or kindly scientist; she is more pragmatically concerned over waste of material than she is interested in the ethical concerns of throwing away lives. Despite their bickering Carter is close with McKinley after growing up together and is loyal to her in everything but experimental procedures. \n\nHer principal field of research is genetic engineering, and has inherited some of the last notes the executives maintain about the FEV research conducted in the corporate vault. It is Carter who pushes to investigate and research wasteland creatures for anything that can be gained, and her boldness has made her relatively popular with even the security staff. After all, even Vault-Tec's finest would rather have some monster die in their place."

Miranda is a personable and charming woman who knows how to get people on her side, and if need be, where to stab a person to make them squeal.\n\nMiranda is well known for her entertaining exercises. She prides herself on coming up with the latest and greatest methods of motivating Vault-Tec's employees. The staff fondly reminisce about going on a raid of the Steamboat Springs Resort Hotel, where they all got a chance to swim in the pool. Who could forget when she had them work together to find the most efficient way to torture that tied up Mutant? Indeed, Miranda Grissom's events are to die for!"

EXE_louis_advisor_desc:0 "Louis Lofton is formerly of the Longknife Long Knives, a raider gang of some regional renown. Louis always used to say that for what they lacked in creativity they made up for in effectiveness.\n\nChased from their territory by the onset of the Monster of the East, the Long Knives scattered on the winds, never to see each other again. Louis got a position with the Executives, and while he's happy to be taken in by someone, he has come to loathe the ridiculous eccentricities of their organization. He figures that for all they have in creativity they lack in effectiveness.\n\nLouis has put what small clout he has behind the good Dr. Carter, who he hopes will talk some sense into the lunkheads that run this outfit. Perhaps he'll recapture the glory days of the Long Knives yet."

EXE_bean_counter:0 "Bean Counter"
EXE_leslie_advisor_desc:0 "Leslie Schade is the Head of Accounting at Vault-Tec. Her responsibility is keeping extensive financial records regarding the corporation's business practises.\n\nLeslie effectively inherited the position of her father. At first she thought it would mean a step up in the world, a chance to prove herself.\n\nThen she experienced the reality of trying to do accounts for an organisation with contempt for accounting. McKinley and her nutcases don't care about leaving accurate reports about their activities. Leslie typically finds out that thousands of caps worth of slaves were turned into a fine paste for an "experiment" a week after it happened. Assets are taken from warehouses without notice, and when Leslie tries to track them down they are often shoved in her face. She is then told to "get out of (the new owner's) face".\n\nLeslie learned that her father died of cirrhosis of the liver. After everything she has experienced, she is following in his footsteps once again."

EXE_ANGUS_NAME:0 "Angus "Carnage" Carnegie"
EXE_explosive_art:0 "The Art of Explosion"
EXE_angus_advisor_desc:0 "Angus Carnegie is the current Head of Engineering. Such as things are, his role typically involves finding ways to implement inventive and horrible weapons. For instance, he is awfully fond of his "Blow-Me-Up Buttercup" idea, having the old Buttercup toys deliver explosive goodness to denizens of the wasteland. He also patted himself on the back for coming up with Barbed Tripwires, first deluding the victim into thinking they just cut themselves, only to find themselves cut to ribbons by a much worse trap.\n\nTo Angus, his work is an artform. It cannot be rushed, streamlined or simplified. Pain and misery must be delivered with expert precision and preferably maximum collateral damage. It would be a grievous disappointment to his moniker if anything less occurred."

EXE_faceless_goon:0 "Right Hand Man"
EXE_eric_advisor_desc:0 "Eric Smith is Vault-Tec's Chief of Security. He recently assumed the position by "promotion", proving he was better suited to the role by killing the previous Security Chief in sanctioned combat.\n\nThe simple fact is Eric Smith is McKinley's man, and the previous Security Chief wasn't. Whoever controls security controls Executive power, and thus McKinley controls security via Eric Smith. She groomed him for the role because he was tough enough to fight well and more importantly unambitious, not seeking to climb the corporate ladder and content to be paid and enjoy a solid position. The perfect subordinate to avoid any creative means of bypassing the Hostile Takeover.\n\nThe Hostile Takeovers are just so much more fun compared to some cloak and dagger coup."

EXE_GALLO_NAME:0 "Timothy Gallo"
EXE_polite_relations:0 "Polite Relations"
EXE_gallo_advisor_desc:0 "Tim was raised on stories from his father of a time when Vault-Tec Security was a respectable institution. They patrolled the pristine halls of the old Vault with dignity, calmly and politely shuffling the Dwellers to their various activities. He always lamented what they'd been driven to, acting like savages, beating each other as much as anyone else. \n\nNow a veteran security officer, Tim Gallo is trying to bring back a little of that world of stories. Respectability, cooperation, a polite handshake. He's even pioneered initiatives to stabilize relations with Vault-Tec's new "franchised communities", hoping to get less quivering in fear and more mutually profitable relations. Sure, it might result in them handing over locals to a life of slavery and experimentation, but if we're all profiting in a stable manner, isn't that what matters?"

EXE_AMELIA_NAME:0 "Amelia Morgan"
EXE_motivational_manager:0 "Motivational Manager"
EXE_amelia_advisor_desc:0 "Amelia has been a manager for some time now, but only recently has she been appointed to head McKinley's "Motivational Movement", an office-cultural campaign intended to bring a breath of fresh air to Vault-Tec. After recently realising that the Executives had a problem with lazy, leeching managers, McKinley has decided they need to motivate those that weren't recently laid off to do better. This is where Amelia comes in, bringing innovative solutions to encourage her fellow employees to give their all for the company. \n\nAmelia knows that fear is a powerful motivator, so she has trialed "Hotseat Days" where an employee has to complete a set amount of work within the time limit to receive the key to their ever-beeping bomb collar. Other under-performing employees are invited to watch to remind them of what might happen if they can't live up to Executive Expectations. \n\nSome might decry the deaths of their fellow employees, but McKinley needs people with killer instinct, and Amelia will embody that while getting others to follow suit."

EXE_NATALIE_NAME:0 "Natalie Pound"
EXE_armour_cutting:0 "Armour Cutting"
EXE_natalie_advisor_desc:0 "Natalie is currently the Director of Armour Production at Vault-Tec. The position has been recently introduced due to the need of the Executives to field more armoured units to extend control over their franchised territories and communities. As an experienced technician, Natalie was thrust into the role and has held it for some time. \n\nOwing to growing pressure on the organisation, Natalie has been pushed harder and harder to pump out products with shorter and shorter deadlines. With the influx of new talent from what some might call "less reputable" sources, Natalie has made a series of corner-cutting innovations based on "wasteland models". A few parts stripped here, a few substandard alloys there, and some wiring that could be generously described as "jury rigged" wherever needed. \n\nMaybe some dumb bastard will die due to equipment failure, but the bosses are happy as long as numbers are met and at the end of the day Vault-Tec wins."

She makes a fairly modest living carrying passengers up and down the local waterways. She pays a cut of her profits every time she passes through our territory. \n\nOne member of Security alleged that she has a more profitable business on the Colorado, but that report is unsubstantiated and rather absurd. Like old Gladhand Gallo tells McKinley, there's no point extorting a paying customer over rumours alone."

Even better everything she could see through it was hers, from the hills in the distance to the slave pens just a couple dozen feet away. The barrel of her anti-material rifle poked out a short distance through the cracked window that was serving as a vantage point, aimed towards those pens. The closest pen held a sullen looking young man staring into the distance, his skin covered in bruises and cuts. He'd been one of the dogs who ran with that idiot Lanius, thinking they'd rule the world until they pissed off someone stronger. McKinley had been that someone stronger, and she barked to the intern behind her with a cruel grin: “Alright; start the experiment.”\n\nA few moments after, the latch on the pen McKinley had been observing fell apart and the door opened just a crack. The former legionnaire inside couldn't hide his surprise at first, but he was clever enough to get up and step to the gate slowly, without urgency or drawing attention. It was only then that he pushed through the opening and sprinted off towards the hills. The guards made a show of shouting and pointing, following half-heartedly behind the runaway. His bare feet kicked up a dust cloud that trailed behind, but it could not obscure him enough that the sniper watching from the shadows lost her target. Behind McKinley, the intern looked up from his pip-boy and said “now.”\n\nThe shot that followed that single word echoed through the hills, and a spray of red-tinged sand erupted into the air. The Executives' CEO stood up and tossed the rifle towards the intern, chuckling as he scrambled to catch it. She lit up a cigar and walked towards the door “We'll use that guy as the control. Tomorrow we'll open two cells and see how far they get before time is up. After that, we'll improvise something, maybe get some land mines.” The intern typed feverishly into his pip-boy, making sure that he got every word recorded in his task log. Before he hit the last key, McKinley was already gone."

The leftovers of the Church of the Lost and Attis' Army had mostly left it be over the years, outside of back and forth claims of ownership. Now however its old inhabitants had come home, and it had become a hub of activity. Interns and slaves bustled about like ants, picking through the old debris and digging in search of any chambers that remained intact. A few were protected by power armor or radiation suits but most were left to simply deal with the rads the hard way. The rest of the Executives were preparing a new temporary headquarters as close to the ruins as they could without the geiger counters on their pip-boys ticking.\n\nMcKinley herself had spearheaded the initiative to reclaim the remains of the vault, hoping that some of the old research and assets had somehow survived. She'd grown up on stories of the amazing and terrible creations of her ancestors and was hungry to get her hands on any of it. Electrical weapons, experimental power armor designs, genetically enhanced deathclaws, advanced robots and AIs, they all could be found within the vault before the Brotherhood and Attis ruined everything. It was her fervent wish that some of it had been preserved by the sturdiness of Vault-Tec's greatest shelter, and could grant the Executives an even sharper edge against the wasteland. The flames of her desire were only stoked when the slaves made their first find:"

They'd been assembled in the remains of an enormous pre-war hangar, with most of the building shrouded in deep shadows. Looking up at her were a number of regular interns and employees but her attention was on the seven managers who stood apart and grew increasingly nervous with each word she uttered. Their weapons and power armor had been taken from them upon arrival before each was given a cloth painted with a bright red Vault-Tec logo.\n\n“I won't blow any smoke up your asses, you're here because none of you are meeting my expectations. Not enough killer instinct, not enough hustle, not enough synergistic solutions, too much time spent playing pip-boy games on the shitter, Sharon. I'm not sure any of you really want to be part of the Vault-Tec family anymore, so it's clearly time for some real leadership. We need to pull together with a team dismantling exercise.” Now the seven managers were downright frightened, stealing glances at the mob of employees behind them who looked back with weapons at the ready and excited smiles. McKinley gestured into the darkness and a series of lights switched on to reveal the rest of the hangar.\n\nIt had been converted into an elaborate obstacle course complete with walls to climb, tires to run through, ropes to swing on and a tall flagpole at the end. McKinley had made sure the interns had filled it with a number of special touches, including bear traps hidden in the tires and greased pits full of teeming radbugs for the ropes to swing over. The final approach to the flagpole was guarded by a chained super mutant who'd been given a sledgehammer and a promise of freedom should he manage to kill any of the runners. Designing the course had been a relaxing pastime for the CEO of the Executives over the last month and she was quite excited to see it in action.\n\nThat excitement was clear in her voice as she returned her attention to the unfortunate managers below “It's simple enough, get to the end and run your flag up the pole. First one who makes it gets to keep their job, the rest get downsized. Consider this a last chance to interview for your position and don't forget to have fun!” An evil smile crept across her face under the helmet as McKinley shouted “Go!”."

You can throw as many slaves and interns on it as you want; Leslie is already in a coma after the last experiment.”\n\n“I don’t need a mountain of bodies, I need time to follow proper scientific processes! Can’t you understand that not everything is best done fast and bloody?”\n\nMcKinley frowned deeply, and she hurled the empty bottle off to the side of her office where it shattered. The pieces joined an already sizable pile of broken glass shards. She barked angrily, “Alright, prove it bitch. You want to call the shots so bad you can put on your big girl power panties and fight me for it. In front of everyone. Get one, just one good hit on me and I’ll let you run R&D on your own.

McKinley was too good of a scrapper.\n\nThe triumphant CEO bent over to grasp Carter’s chestplate and pulled back her other fist into a ready pose. “Ready to cry auntie?” Carter lashed out then, a last minute attempt to sneak out a win, but her gauntleted hand was caught in mid swing. “That’s the spirit,” McKinley laughed. “Not gonna help, but it’ll look great on your next performance review.” McKinley then took a swing of her own, smashing square into Carter’s visor. It took three more increasingly violent blows before Carter took the advice of her suits screaming shock absorbers and waved her hand to quit.\n\nShe lay dazed for a moment before McKinley helped her stand and propped her up. “Do we understand each other, Jeanette?” Carter nodded silently, her ego and body both bruised.

He’d been mopping a sub-level of the vault when a giant ant had burst through the wall and attacked him. The door to the room had then entered security lockdown and sealed him inside with the angry insect. A desperate battle had ensued, with the aging intern resorting to breaking his mop to use as an impromptu spear. The monstrous bug had died with its jaws still clamped around his ankle, half a mop stabbed through its head.\n\nThis was all seen through a camera many rooms away by a pair of junior researchers and McKinley. The rest of the science staff had declined to observe the experiment but it had been McKinley’s idea and she was enjoying herself. She gestured towards the monitor with a beer in her hand and commented, “Good use of company property there, resourceful. Well, we won’t know how fatal giant ant bites are until the poor bastard dies. Send in another!” The researchers scrambled to begin the next phase of the experiment.\n\nFrank felt a rumbling in the floor and looked up to see another hole breaking open in the wall.

That California place some of them scream about maybe? Besides, what could be more useful than knowing how to break their bones?”\n\nExasperatedly, Carter turned around and answered, “Maybe how their immunity to radiation actually works? Or their resistance to infection? Maybe ways to make docile laborers out of them? I can imagine a number of more useful things.

They’d been hired to ostensibly clear out some insects from an old ruin, but in reality it was a front for the Executives to test their bioweapons. “See, everything worked out great,” McKinley slurred as she gestured at one screen. On it they watched a radbug wade through submachine gun fire to then pounce on its target. \n\n“They’re performing… adequately.” Carter was actually quite proud but meant to maintain composure in front of her subordinates. So many sleepless nights had been spent adjusting strains and stretching their limited supply of control insects, but the monstrous creatures had been responding well to her methods and trials.\n\n“Adequate? Fuck you. You did good Jeanette, you made some good bugs.” The CEO slapped her on the shoulder and handed her a beer before wrapping an arm around her cheerfully. “Lighten up, enjoy the show.” McKinley gave Carter’s shoulders a brief squeeze as one monitor went red from splashed viscera, and the screams of mercenaries came in clear from the speakers.

Rows of treadmills, weight sets, quiz terminals and marksmanship ranges filled the massive room, all in use by one or more employees. Research division staff were monitoring and recording everything in the midst of the clamor and activity, creating a database of everyone’s performance.\n\nThey were being pushed to the brink too; the smell of sweat, blood and vomit filled the room as everyone tried their hardest. And why wouldn’t they, when they knew the worst performers would be transferred to ‘Uptopland’? Morgan chuckled to herself; in 75 it had been an imaginary place made to scare children but here well, no one wanted to be shipped off to die in the very real dust of the wasteland.

And what the fuck happened to that guy?” The CEO pointed to a particularly bloody corpse in the corner.\n\n“Well, the gas turned out to be a powerful and aggressive hallucinogen. After a short while they grew intoxicated, and before you get excited not long after that they became extremely violent. Screaming at each other and starting brawls before tearing each other apart.

I’ve taken some inspiration from the lost tesla models of the old vault as well as some of my past works. I present: The Ribbon Dancer!” The machine that hummed to life was bulky, pivoting on four multi jointed legs, and with a central body that freely turned 360 degrees. Ports opened and long ropes of barbed wire unspooled to spill across the ground. As the onlookers whispered amongst themselves the central body of the dancer began to spin and rapidly pick up speed, the trailing wires soon creating a vortex of sharp metal around it.\n\n“Let’s see it in action” Carnegie roared to the crowd. The robot marched towards two screaming test subjects who’d been staked to the ground. The first was shredded into a red mist and ribbons of torn flesh within moments as the dancer did their work, but the second managed to slip their bonds and limped away as fast as they could. In response to Carnegie’s commands the dancer entered pursuit, chasing the escaping subject. As it followed the runner into a stand of trees, the whirling wires wrapped around the old dead trunks. Metal strained and the robot gave off a long hiss as it proceeded to then pull two entire trees down on itself before shutting down. The escapee didn’t get far as Carnegie himself drew a gun to shoot them down before turning back to the crowd."

Sections of it had clearly been replaced with metal and parts from other sources, including vault walls and power armour pieces, but it was largely in one piece. McKinley simply whispered “The fuck?”\n\n“Angus helped me fix it up for you. It’s the only Mr. Buddy beta model we found in an even slightly repairable state.” Carter watched as McKinley moved closer to admire its armour and electric cannon. To the CEO it looked just like she’d imagined it would from the stories. Carter continued on, telling her “If it breaks again we probably can’t fix it, to be honest. We’ve not put together just how it all works yet, but I remembered how disappointed you were that we only found completely shattered ones and couldn’t restart production. So uh, it’s all yours. Sorry for keeping it a secret.”\n\nMcKinley whirled around and pulled Carter in close, squeezing her tight. “Best fuckin’ gift I ever got in my life.

She’d been in the workshop for what felt like days.

Food and water had been an afterthought until now and she felt her stomach was rumbling and tongue dry in her mouth. She was also sure she needed a shower but all of that could wait until after she’d shown the bosses what she’d made.\n\nCombining bits of scrapped tesla bots, ruined tesla suits that had been pulled from the corporate vault’s wreckage, and pieces of various armour suits claimed from the wasteland she’d made a Frankenstein's monster of a suit. Heavier than older vault-tec designs that they’d resorted to using in recent years, it was equipped with a high efficiency energy transfer system and defensive shock generators capable of frying a radbug’s face off.

For long minutes McKinley and Dyed-Red fought, first at range where they brought down an entire prewar building around themselves with errant machine gun and shotgun fire. When they emerged from the rubble each had merely been scraped and bruised by the exchange. It was in close, as they resorted to hand to hand melee, where they each began to feel the other’s strength. Soon the battle ground to a halt as both the vault dwellers and warriors of the Rock stopped to watch.\n\nMcKinley in her suit had the advantage over Dyed Red in strength and toughness, but the wily chief was faster and bearishly strong himself. Both were scrappers willing to do anything. Finally McKinley took a gamble and left herself open. As Dyed Red brought down his hooked axe into her chest her own sledge came around wide, smashing into his side. The man crashed to the dirt, clutching the ribs he knew were broken and leaving McKinley looming over him. One of her eyepieces was smashed, mirroring his own missing eye, and her armor was dented and battered from the long fight.\n\nShe yanked the hook from her chestplate, where it had lodged itself inches from her heart, and tossed it aside as she looked down at the man. “You’re fucking good, real fucking good. You want a job?” She held out a hand for him to take as she waited for his response. Everyone was silent as he pondered if this is what destiny had held in store for him, until finally"

Two days later the Executives had attacked again, this time with McKinley leading the charge.\n\nIt was a feint however, using the CEO as bait for a trap, and once Lanius smelled the blood of an enemy commander he took it. He aggressively counterattacked, following as McKinley and her forces slowly allowed themselves to be pushed into a prewar ruin. Lanius challenged McKinley then, taunting her as a cowardly woman and ordering her to face him. Laughing, amused by the man’s bullish nature, McKinley goaded him and retreated one more time. Pursuing her, he stepped directly into a trap that had been laid before in the dead of night. Wrapping around him, a hooked metallic net restrained him before filling him with enough voltage to kill a deathclaw.\n\nMcKinley stepped forward then, blowing away multiple legionnaires attempting to reach their fallen leader with her shredder and calling for her employees to attack the stunned legion troops.

And yet he had not wasted away or fallen apart; quite the opposite.

He wielded it now, fending off the newest strain of radbugs that Carter had prepared for field testing. How long they could last against Lanius was their final test before full production. A number of employees had made a habit to come and see the man whenever he was tested, watching and wagering about whether he’d finally die.\n\nThose betting against the former legate had always been disappointed in the past and today was no different. The larger, more armoured radbugs put up a better fight than the last ones he’d killed but they found themselves butchered all the same. Lanius took a horn from one to keep and stared impassively at the crowd before allowing himself to be led back to his cell and relinquishing his sword.

It was an old engineer named Charles Jones who stepped forward to present a new plan. Instead of attacking the Legate, they’d lure him into a trap and take him down without a face to face fight. Some had doubts that it was a bit of a looney plan, but McKinley gave him the go ahead. Jones and Carnegie worked through the night and the next day the plan was put into action.\n\nUsing recordings of women existing, Lanius was lured from his warcamp, the man incensed into action by the sound. He followed it, some of his men in tow, into a box canyon where the rest of the trap was sprung. First barrels of TNT detonated around the canyon, killing the other legion men but leaving Lanius to walk out of the dust cloud intact. He shouted in fury only to be cut off as a piano fell onto him from the top of the canyon. The Executives began to celebrate until the sound of piano keys hitting the ground indicated that Lanius was climbing out of the rubble.\n\nThe Legate was dazed, seeing stars, but managed to stand and take a step forward regardless.

It was Engineer Charles Jones again who ended up proposing the most popular idea, and he and Carnegie went to work on it the next day. \n\nA week later the Executives senior staff and a number of junior employees had gathered at the old town where Lanius had been captured in the first place. Jones and Carnegie proudly unveiled the largest catapult the world had ever seen, aimed westward. The crowd cheered as Lanius was loaded into the bowl, the huge man dwarfed by its size. He shouted at them as Jones prepared to pull the lever and launch him back to Arizona. “You profligate degenerates are despicable!”\n\nSeconds later the Legate was merely a gleam in the desert sun, flying off into the far distance.

  exe_vault.42.d:0 "Underneath the dusty remnants of the prewar town of Old Vegas lay the freshly built Vault E37. Its steel walls were filled with flashing lights, jingling coin sounds and garish colors all designed to bring the casino experience to the region. This vault was built with not just experimentation in mind but also leisure and tourism. Rows and rows of traditional and experimental games of chance filled the great hall that dominated the first floor. The biggest draw was the new Vault-Tec electronic game line, playable through a pip-boy without the need of a dealer and displaying top of the line pixelated images.\n\nOn the second floor engineers manipulated game odds in real time and researchers recorded vast amounts of data regarding gambler behavior. It was their jobs to develop new games, conduct social experiments and ensure Vault-Tec Entertainment Division always came out ahead at the end of the day. They were instructed to save their worst manipulations for outsiders however, as too many destitute employees reflected ill on the company.\n\nAlready the call of the vault and its games of chance worked throughout the nearby lands and travelers looking for Vegas quickly became frequent in and around Vault-Tec territorial holdings. The town on the surface had slowly lurched to life during construction, with traders and entrepreneurs setting up shop to serve the Vault-Tec interns overseeing construction, and now it was coming back in full. It was an incorporated town so any business done kicked back a little to the company overall, making Vault-Tec ever richer."

  exe_vault.43.t:0 "Green Hell’s Basement"
  exe_vault.43.d:0 "Constructing a vault underneath a riotous, mutant forest had not been easy. Numerous slaves and interns had been lost to various diseases, toxic flora, and mutant creatures of all kinds. Vault E245 is nestled beneath the trees now however, daring them to try digging their roots in. CRO Carter is the acting overseer for the vault though her attention and time is spread thin so she is rarely present. E245 is focused on experiments dealing with the mutated plant life, its possible uses, and whether it’s possible to recreate the tainted GECK that was used to make it.\n\nProgress is already being made, with researchers having discovered a fern that has slight mutagenic properties reminiscent of FEV. It’s a line of research that’s likely years out from any real fruits but it’s a sign that the research is worth doing. Further work is slowed however by constant clashes between security forces and the jungle itself, as gathering more samples is rather difficult when they fight back. More Vault-Tec brand flamethrowers are being manufactured even now."

  exe_vault.44.t:0 "A Haunted Hole"
  exe_vault.44.d:0 "Vault E14 had been constructed very close to the chapel of the now defunct Chained Choir, close enough for a tunnel to reach the underground facility responsible for those strange psykers. Everything about the research conducted within was something of a mystery to Vault-Tec research staff and there were entire file cabinets worth of proposals on where to begin. Even more intrigued was CEO McKinley herself. Tales of haunted psychics controlling the minds of their victims and turning them into puppets reminded her of pulp comics she’d enjoyed as a child.\n\nShe’d ordered a research vault in the hopes of one day recreating some of the results that had birthed the choir. Some of the researchers she told in plain terms “Find a way to give me psychic powers, but without the demons or voices in my head.” Progress is slow to start however and real progress is likely years away. Starting from scratch by reverse engineering what little documentation remains under the chapel is the best the team can do for now. It’s not helped by the pervasive reports of staff feeling uncomfortable or watched while inside the brand new vault. They say they enjoy the music though."

  exe_vault.45.t:0 "A Personal Playground"
  exe_vault.45.d:0 "The vault built under Dallas, numbered E213, was built to very particular specifications. Everything was constructed to suit the singular vision of CEO McKinley, who insisted on heading up the architectural design team for E213. Her hands are now on every inch of the vault. The first floor is near standard with quarters and amenities for staff as well as a lavish office for the Chief Executive herself. The only oddity really is that there is a large and fully stocked arsenal on the floor that sees a lot of traffic. Deeper than the first floor however is where things start to become more unique.\n\nThe bottom floor is a prison, made for holding traitors to the company as well as captive mutants and brotherhood of steel agents. Every now and then one would be released from their cell and into the floors between. These levels were designed to act as a deadly labyrinth made to grind down these would-be escapees. McKinley had envisioned halls stuffed with traps, rooms filled with lethal hazards, hostile security systems and more to test the unlucky subjects. Devices planted throughout the vault would record everything for research and posterity purposes. Should anyone make it all the way to the first floor they would find McKinley waiting, either to offer them a job or a lethal beating with her hammer."

  exe_vault.46.t:0 "True Homecoming"
  exe_vault.46.d:0 "The grand reopening of the Corporate Vault was a gala affair, attended by hundreds of employees as well as representatives from dozens of franchised communities and neighboring powers. There was no violence, and no expense had been spared to provide refreshments for all in attendance. This was a special day for the restored Vault-Tec and the occasion had McKinley and the rest of the senior staff feeling generous. It was after all a chance to show off the wealth, power and prestige of Vault-Tec and leave a lasting impression on all who came.\n\nCEO McKinley herself christened the vault as the door opened ceremonially. She had no patience for giving tours however and left that work to Grissom and her team before heading off to the bar with Carter. Spirits were very high; the CEO was all smiles even while wearing her formal suit and Leslie Schade was actually sober.\n\nThe reconstruction narrative was something of a misnomer in actuality, as the old vault ruins were still too radioactive for large scale construction or long term dwelling. The new corporate vault had been built as close as reasonable to the old one however, and would be their new home."
