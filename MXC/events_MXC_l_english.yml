  nf_maxson.1.t:0 "Personal Log - The Expedition's Beginnings"
  nf_maxson.1.d:0 ""This is Paladin Commander Andrea Brixley, recording a personal log to...to make sure if I don't pull us through this someone knows what happened."\n\nSitting back in her chair Andrea sighs and runs a hand through her short cropped hair. Going on she begins with "We all had high hopes at the start, heading out east. The Elder from Lost Hills chosen to lead the expedition, Elder Cameron, was a good leader. Well respected and he had seen plenty of combat."\n\n"I was chosen to come along, to lead my Paladins and Knights in case we were attacked. I remember there was a debate over what resources the expedition was to be given...""
  nf_maxson.1.a:0 ""We set out with a large amount of personnel but not much equipment.""
  nf_maxson.1.b:0 ""We set out with a small amount of personnel but with enough equipment for everyone.""
    #Number 2#
  nf_maxson.4.t:0 "Personal Log - Howling And Screams"
  nf_maxson.4.d:0 ""Our arrival into Colorado was without fanfare. The tribes and settlements near to our destination had warned us that our goal was guarded by vicious hounds, The Hangdogs."\n\n"Elder Cameron wasn't a fool, but..." Andrea's hand clenches into a fist before going on "none of us knew the scale of the foe we were to face."\n\n"We had entered Denver but we had only encountered scavengers, no sign of the foe we were told to expect. Some of us were unnerved, but most assumed the raiders had been driven off or destroyed before our arrival." A bitter grimace forms on Andrea's face and she shakes her head back and forth.\n\n"If only we were so lucky." Andrea says, pausing to collect herself before going on "The first night after we had set ourselves up, we were making plans for the expedition's first tasks. That was when they attacked."\n\n"It was a massacre, we were forced to retreat over the river with what little we could carry with us.""
  nf_maxson.4.a:0 ""Our only hope was the bunker.""
    #Number 3#
  nf_maxson.2.t:0 "Personal Log - Our Refuge"
  nf_maxson.2.d:0 ""Elder Cameron had been wounded badly during the battle and retreat but still managed to lead us south-east, he knew there was a bunker we could take shelter in while we regroup. Shattered and depleted our expedition fled across the river, the hounds of the Hangdogs right behind us."\n\n"A fighting retreat to a bunker we hoped wasn't occupied, or for all we knew was destroyed during The Great War. I had hoped our luck had finally turned when we arrived and found it not only intact but still secured and well stocked with supplies...""
  nf_maxson.2.a:0 ""and one last disaster to nearly destroy us.""
    #Number 4#
  nf_maxson.3.t:0 "Personal Log - Madness In The Underground"
  nf_maxson.3.d:0 ""No one is sure how a Senator got his hands on a shipment of Stealth Boys, but the Elder thought we could use them to scout across the river and find more of our scattered expedition. The senior and most experienced of us, those that were still alive, were sent out with a sack full of the devices to help cross the river and survive in the Hangdogs territory."\n\n"In the weeks and months that followed they managed to bring back as many of our Brothers that they could find. Things seemed to be getting better...but maybe that hope blinded us to the truth."\n\n"Elder Cameron had miraculously recovered, enough to walk without assistance, and our recovery teams were returning. I went out of the bunker with the Elder to greet them, but something was very wrong. It had been worsening inside of them for a time but the recovery teams were suffering from overuse of the Stealth Boys, they didn't believe the Elder was alive, and after a tense argument weapons were drawn."\n\n"I couldn't believe my eyes when a Paladin put a round through the Elder's torso. Our side fired back while the recovery team members began to scatter and fire wildly. Not just at us but even at each other."\n\n"With the death of Elder Cameron, and the scattering of most of our senior Knights and Paladins...I have become the highest ranked Brother left. The Expedition now succeeds...or fails by my efforts."\n\n§RCheck the decisions tab. Look towards the Boulder Dome to cure their condition, regaining the lost members of our Chapter would be far better than having to put them down.§!"
  nf_maxson.3.a:0 ""Can I do this? I have to.""

  #Scribe Focus Events#

  nf_maxson.7.t:0 "Checking on Elrick"
  nf_maxson.7.d:0 "Making her way down the access corridor towards the bunker's storage rooms Andrea clenches and unclenches her hands inside the powered armor. She knows the routine is important to keeping herself steady but loathes having to check in on every little detail. Before all this she was a leader in battle, not a babysitter for the scribes. Thankfully the T-51b armor keeps her dour expression from view as she passes by saluting Brothers, nodding to them as she continues on to her destination.\n\nSlapping her gauntlet against the open switch and stepping through the doorway she can hear the sound of raised voices in the storage room. Glancing over she notices two scribes arguing by one of the tables with armor and laser rifles laid out on them.\n\nTurning her attention from them she sees the man she came to check on, Proctor Elrick. The Proctor is sitting behind a desk by the far wall, a terminal screen lighting up his aged features green in the dim lighting. Striding forward, her boots clanging against the metal, the Proctor looks up and over at the two scribes by the table with a sour expression before slowly getting to his feet and greeting Andrea. "Paladin Commander, here for the daily count?"\n\nShaking his head Elrick goes on to say "I understand your need to check in on things, but surely a weekly inspection would accomplish the same thing."\n\nAndrea's frown deepens in response to his words, her voice harsh as it barks out of the helmets speakers "If this is that severe of an interruption Proctor then I suggest you give me your report quickly and efficiently, then you can get back to your duties.""
  nf_maxson.7.a:0 ""We all have roles to fill, even if we don't like them.""

  nf_maxson.11.t:0 "The Argument"
  nf_maxson.11.d:0 "Andrea sees Elrick stiffen but his eyes never waver, and she sighs internally. Helmet speakers crackling to life again "I have more to do today than argue with you Proctor. Tell me the daily count and also," she says before gesturing to her left "if you could explain to me what they're arguing about."\n\nElrick's head turns from her helmet to the pair of scribes who have still been arguing by the table for their entire conversation. "Today's count is twenty eight laser rifles and eight suits of power armor. As for those two, they have proposed we use the experimental schematics, untested schematics at that, we brought with us from Lost Hills. They should allow us to produce and maintain more advanced suits of powered armor or the same but with energy weapons"\n\nProctor Elrick shakes his head before going on "The problem is they can agree that we should use them given our situation but can't agree which to use. Without the resources or the skilled manpower to use both it's not an easy decision for them."\n\nTurning her helmeted gaze back to the Proctor she asks "And? You're their senior, surely you have your own opinion."\n\nElrick shakes his head and sighs, his gaze finally turning down and away from Brixley "To tell the truth with my workload I've ignored them for the most part..." Running a hand through his graying hair he mutters "I didn't think it was too important."\n\nAndrea can tell the Proctor is as disinterested in this as with most of his "mundane" tasks, and speaks up after a few more moments of contemplation."
  nf_maxson.11.a:0 ""Tell them our power armor could use an edge.""
  nf_maxson.11.b:0 ""Tell them our energy weapons could use an edge.""

  nf_maxson.12.t:0 "Now That's Taken Care Of"
  nf_maxson.12.d:0 "Andrea's decision seems to relieve Elrick, she hears a small exhale of breath before a smile creases his features. "Yes Paladin Commander, right away."\n\nHolding up her arm to bar his way she stops Elrick who was moving away from his desk to the arguing scribes, and says "We, no I have enough to deal with as it is Elrick. Now is not the time to slack off when we need every advantage we can get. The daily inspections will continue until you improve."\n\nThe Proctor's relieved expression turns to an exasperated one, but he salutes before saying "Yes Paladin Commander, I understand." Andrea watches as he moves off towards his subordinates, before turning and making for the exit. Her helmet keeps her muttering private as she leaves."
  nf_maxson.12.a:0 ""One down, six more to go...""

  #Trader Intro Events#
  nf_maxson.13.t:0 "The Leftovers"
  nf_maxson.13.d:0 "Shaking her head back and forth in wonder at the impressive stockpile before turning to the Knight standing beside her, Andrea asks "How many of them actually run?"\n\n"We're still checking over the other vehicle depots but current count is 244 vehicles that vary from single seat compact cars all the way to larger utility trucks." The Knight replied.\n\nLooking up from their clipboard the Knight continues "Those are the ones that run, the rest are in a state of disrepair. We assume they were used by The Scorpions to keep their vehicles used for raiding in working order."\n\nAndrea nods curtly before musing in a low voice "We won't have enough energy cells to use these as well as our powered armor..."\n\nBy her side the Knight speaks up "We could still use them for logistical purposes even in a limited capac-" before he is cut off by a new voice from behind the both of them."
  nf_maxson_13.a:0 ""Hey, you're the boss around here right?""

  nf_maxson.131.t:0 "Dan Rivers"
  nf_maxson.131.d:0 "Turning quickly and placing a hand on the butt of her laser pistol Andrea sees a smiling man, clearly not Brotherhood. Looking more like some well off wastelander, his hands out to the side as he notices the plain hostility in the movements of the two before him before saying "Woah woah, just asking a question here, not something you shoot someone over right? I hope not." Andrea quickly sizes him up, not a threat. Not to her person at least, maybe to her money. She asks in a stern tone "What's your business here wastelander?"\n\nThe man's smile doesn't waver as he replies "The name's Dan Rivers, I'm a trader from The Forager's, used to run a route between New Monrose to Poteau who's been through these parts many times. Came here to offer my services to the newcomers. Didn't mean to eavesdrop as well but those fancy suits of yours carry your voices pretty far."\n\nAndrea says nothing, but does remember The Forager's from the journey to Colorado, they warned them about the Hangdogs. "If only we'd taken their warnings seriously..." she thinks to herself.\n\nDan jabs a thumb into his vest before going on "You see, I can get you a lot more out of these vehicles than you probably can. I've got plenty of contacts and if you'd let me use those up till they run dry, which would let you not worry about the fuel situation, then you get a chunk of my profits and some supplies from those willing to help against the Hangdogs."\n\nAndrea ponders for a few moments, this man is a stranger but with the Expedition stretched thin as it is having an ally who knows the locals would be an excellent asset. She knows they'll need every single Brother for the war against the Hangdogs, let alone what comes after. "If we win." she mutters under her breath.\n\nHer eyes flick up inside her helmet to Dan before she says "You can use these vehicles, but you will need to have an escort of some of my Brothers, to keep you honest. I'm sure you understand." Andrea was sure Dan's grin couldn't get wider, but it does as his hands turn into finger guns aimed in her direction as he proudly announces "Dan Rivers will keep you afloat, my personal guarantee!""
  nf_maxson_131.a:0 "Little strange, but he could be useful."

  #Airship Events#

  nf_maxson.airship.t:0 "The Other Expedition East"
  nf_maxson.airship.d:0 "Andrea, Elrick, and Outsider trudged quietly between the canyon walls. Outsider took up the lead, as he'd walked this path a half dozen times already, he was relaxed to the point of annoying Andrea, who clutched her rifle sternly, scanning their surroundings for the upteenth time. \n\nProctor Elrick lagged behind; expending half of his breath complaining about the fact that he had to make such a journey in the first place. "I don't see why you couldn't ask any other scribe to come along on this..." \n\nOutsider chuckled, perching on a rock in a mocking triumph while glancing back at the scribe. "'Cause you're smart, and you could use the exercise!" \n\nElrick simply grumbled a curse in retort, taking another long swig from one of his six canteens. \n\nHer patience shortening, Andrea finally spoke. "How close are we to this...discovery, of you-" \n\nShe was cut short as they crested the ridge and saw it. Before them stood the massive skeletal remains of an airship, draped with tattered canvas and the ruined remains of Brotherhood insignias. \n\nNearly a century ago the Lost Hills chapter sent a minority group of the Brotherhood east to investigate the remaining mutant threat, fleeing after The Master's defeat. No word was ever received in the west of their fate, but this wreck seems to be the gravemarker for the expedition. \n\nJudging by one of the terminals Elrick had recovered from the wreck (damn durable things, they are) indicate that after arrival, brotherhood forces occupied a nearby AFB and attempted to use it as a headquarters. They seem to have abandoned the Airbase, aswell, but they left behind a lot of working aerial technology that we can repurpose for ourselves."
  nf_maxson.airship.a:0 "Establish a basecamp nearby."

  nf_maxson_prepare.1.t:0 "The Past Revealed"
  nf_maxson_prepare.1.d:0 "After a proper investigation, we discovered the cause of the airships failure. Something caught the gas inside the main balloon on fire, we presume it must have been one of the storms prevelant in the Midwest. The lighter but flammable gasses giving the airships the range they would need for the original expedition certainly was not worth the deaths of those onboard. Our scouting efforts have not revealed nearby wrecks though, so the rest of the fleet must have survived, for how long and how far away they are now we can only speculate. Knowing all this though, and not needing a long range airship, we can repair the wreck and fill it with non flammable gas to use for our own purposes."
  nf_maxson_prepare.1.a:0 "A fine addition to our arsenal."

  nf_maxson_prepare.2.t:0 "Pristine Relics"
  nf_maxson_prepare.2.d:0 "In the former Robot City territory our scouts have found an airfield, untouched by the war but still neglected. Sealed inside the hangers they found a small fleet of cargo planes, mostly preserved from the elements."
  nf_maxson_prepare.2.a:0 "I'm sure we will find a use for them."

  nf_maxson.8.t:0 "Air Power"

  #Story stuff#

  nf_maxson.5.t:0 "Complete Our Mission"
  nf_maxson.5.d:0 "Andrea balanced the little white cylinder between her fingers, idly twiddling the lit cigarette whilst her gaze was cast down on the map below. She saw a crudely drawn depiction of Hangdogs Territory, criss-crossed with a web of arrows depicting the planned advance into Denver. \n\nBrixley had poured over these plans a dozen times in the last hour; yet even as she appreciated their tactical complexity, her mind was still saddled with doubt. \n\nWould it work? Could it be done better? Is it worth it? \n\nShe'd query herself repeatedly, but always come up short on answers. The situation felt strinkingly unfair; Andrea did –not– want to be responsible for any of this, let alone if it was going to cost the lives of her Brothers. \n\nShe took a long drag from the cigarette, its embered front glowing aggresively. \n\nWell, if not her, then who? \n\nReally, who? She couldn't name any competent tacticians that had survived Denver, nor could she exactly push the problem down the chain. \n\nIt occurred to Andrea that it –couldn't– be anybody else, and it never could have been. This wasn't just a fluke, it was fate; she was the one who stepped up, and if she hadn't, the Expedition wouldn't have survived. \n\nNow, the weight of authority rests solely on her shoulders and the success of the mission depends solely on her iniative. \n\nConfidence is no longer a luxury, it's a necessity; and when Brixley stepped into the leading position, she vowed to do everything necessary to finish the mission. \n\nAnything less simply wouldn't do."
  nf_maxson.5.a:0 "Ad Victoriam."

  nf_maxson.14.t:0 "A Dispute"
  nf_maxson.14.d:0 "Up on a rise overlooking the eastern lands of New Syracuse Andrea gazes through a pair of binoculars. Not that there's much to see, though from the reports New Syracuse used to have at least some industry. Most of it hasn't been used for two centuries, but that's better than it being obliterated by The Great War.\n\nPutting the binoculars and handing them to the Knight next to her Andrea turns and starts heading down the hill towards the tent. Pushing open the flap with her power armored hand and stepping through she sees the trader Dan Rivers bent over a physical map layed out on the table, with Proctor Elrick sitting down next to him.\n\n"Any progress?" She asks the pair. At her question the two both turn their attention to her, Dan putting on his easy smile while Elrick gets up slowly to salute, his face impassive. The Proctor speaks up first "Plenty, with Mr River's connections and our own scouting we have the most important locations mapped out with a plan in place for our takeover."\n\nDan also speaks up saying "Mostly have a plan in place, I'd like to ask that we don't move the people from the New Syracuse Steak House. They're comfortable there and you won't gain much if anything from moving them."\n\nElrick scoffs and counters "That is one of the largest buildings in the town, of course we can gain something from it."\n\nAndrea sighs and asks "Why is it an issue to move them? We've already dedicated enough men and resources to restoring the buildings in town, it's not like they'll be homeless if we move them."\n\n"
  nf_maxson.14.a:0 "The Sauce"

  nf_maxson.141.t:0 "Sacred Bottles"
  nf_maxson.141.d:0 ""Steak sauce?" Andrea asks, raising an eyebrow inside her helmet.\n\nDan nods and goes on "Yes ma'am, the people living in that building worship the "sacred bottles", have done so for centuries now." Andrea stares at him, speechless.\n\nElrick asks in an exasperated tone "Can't they just take the bottles with them? They can set up some shrine in the new houses they'll be staying in."\n\nDan shakes his head and taps the map with a finger "I know these people Proctor, the bottles are behind glass up on raised platforms, it's some sort of pre-war display. Taking them down from their current locations would be blasphemy to them."\n\nAndrea places a hand up to her helmet to think, this isn't that big of an issue but it seems to have Dan riled up, and Elrick is as unconcerned about anyone else as usual. While the Proctor's decision will overrule anything the trader says Dan will keep arguing for this if he thinks it's the right thing to do. That will waste time, as strange as this is it's not something she wants the two dwelling on.\n\nSo, she makes the decision for them."
  nf_maxson.141.a:0 ""Don't move them, we can work around them.""
  nf_maxson.141.b:0 ""Move them, we need the space.""

  nf_maxson.15.t:0 "The Dreary-Go-Around"
  nf_maxson.15.d:0 "Andrea wasn't sure what she was looking at. Ostensibly, it was a Brotherhood Reconnaissance trooper, but judging from the reports, he was far more than that.\n\nIn the retreat from Denver him and a few dozen men were separated by a raider ambush and ended up at the wrong bunker entirely. It was a Pre-War rations stockhouse just south of Fort Lyon that had miraculously been mostly undisturbed since the bombs fell.\n\nSo, he and the men camped out inside it, got the bunker transmitter working, and put out a SOS signal prompting discovery by the rest of the Expedition.\n\nThat all seemed simple enough, but there were a number of peculiarities with the man himself.\n\nFirstly, his armor was heavily modified; sporting bandoliers, satchels, some kind of helmet mounted infrared scope, and mounts for a ghillie net.\n\nSecondly, he refused all requests at his actual name, and everyone he had lead to the stockhouse revealed they didn't actually know it. Even his holotags had been tampered with to only display his favored nickname, "Outsider".\n\nThirdly was his manner of speech. He'd picked up something of a wastelander's accent and all of the informal dialect that came with it.\n\nWhilst Andrea was lost in thought about the odd man, he had been standing at an increasingly uncomfortable attention. "Need anything else, Miss-"\n\n"Paladin Commander." She corrected, there was no "Miss Brixley" in this bunker.\n\n"Sorry, Paladin Commander. The uh...only other issue is what we're going to with the food. There's a ton of it down there.""
  nf_maxson.15.a:0 "Sell it to the local merchants."
  nf_maxson.15.b:0 "Give it away to volunteers."

  nf_maxson.21.t:0 "Elrick's Task"
  nf_maxson.21.d:0 "Making her way down the hallways of the underground sections at Union Station Andrea stops in front of the door to the Scribe's main lab Pressing her hand against the access button and stepping through she sees Elrick muttering to himself as he rapidly types at the keys of his terminal.\n\n"Harder at work than I think I've ever seen you Proctor." Andrea says to get his attention. It does the trick as he almost jumps out of his chair and quickly stands to salute.\n\n"Palad-uh I mean Elder, apologies I didn't see you come in!" Elrick blurts out. Andrea raises an eyebrow in surprise, this is also the fastest she's seen the aged man move as well.\n\nWith a quick gesture to dismiss his salute she smiles and says "I'm not here to reprimand you Proctor just to check in on what your current project is. You finally have access to Denver's vast secrets, I know it's what you've been looking forward to since we left Lost Hills."\n\nElrick nods quickly and gestures for her to come over to his side of the terminal "Yes it was the reason why I joined the expedition. I-" The Proctor averts his gaze a little before going on "I apologize for my previous attitude Elder. To be honest I didn't believe we would accomplish much after our retreat from this place."\n\nAndrea nods, her smile faltering a little before replying "The sacrifices of the Brothers who gave us this opportunity must be honored. Now, let's see what you're working on shall we.""
  nf_maxson.21.a:0 "The Map"

  nf_maxson.211.t:0 "Warden's Location"
  nf_maxson.211.d:0 ""A map? Of all the sites used by the WARDEN AI?" Andrea asks as she takes in the information on the terminal screen. It certainly looked like one, with several bright spots highlighted across the city.\n\nElrick nods, voice tinged with excitement as he explains "Yes! The sites we've found all point towards a central location. I need to visit these three in particular-" His finger taps the screen on the spots "Site B", "Site C", and "Site D" "to find what I hypothesis will be "Site A", where the WARDEN is actually housed."\n\nAndrea will consider for a moment then asks "What do you hope to accomplish by finding WARDEN? These pre-war AI tend to be dangerous Proctor, not to be taken lightly."\n\nElrick's face breaks into a weary smile before says with confidence "I will be very careful Elder, I haven't waited this long to mess up here and now."\n\nAndrea studies her subordinates face, he almost seems like a new man with the turn of fate he's experienced. They've all been granted a second chance, to do what they came all this way to accomplish. With a few pats on the man's shoulder she stands up to her full height before saying "Very well Proctor Elrick, I hope to hear of your success soon."\n\nStomping towards the door in her armored boots she takes a moment to glance back towards Elrick, seeing him typing away at his terminal once again with complete focus. Shaking her head in wonder she steps through and closes the door behind her."
  nf_maxson.211.a:0 "We needed this victory, all of us."

  nf_maxson.22.t:0 "A Memorial"
  nf_maxson.22.d:0 "Andrea placed her hand against the etched metal plaque. The first of them had arrived from Maxson Bunker yesterday, ordered by her to record the names of all those Brothers who had fallen at Union Station. There would be three in total, placed above the inner doors of the terminal.\n\nInside the powered armor Andrea can only stare as her fingers move down the list and hover on a few select names. She knew this wouldn't make the memories any less painful, but she can take comfort in knowing they won't be forgotten. It wouldn't be right to forget.\n\n"Elder?" a voice asks beside her. Turning to look she can see a knight, Chris, to her left. "What is it knight?"\n\nQuickly adopting a salute Chris says "A Dan Rivers is out on the platforms Elder, he wishes to speak with you."\n\nNodding to the man Andrea tells him "Thank you knight, dismissed." Marching to the doors leading out of the terminal and pushing them open she can see Dan across the trainyard. As soon as he sees her the man begins waving in her direction.\n\n"What has he come up with now I wonder..." Andrea thinks to herself, as she picks her way through the still damaged sections of Union Station."
  nf_maxson.22.a:0 "Keeping The City Afloat"

  nf_maxson.221.t:0 "The New Denver"
  nf_maxson.221.d:0 ""Slow down Dan." Andrea nearly pleads with the trader, the moment she got within earshot Rivers had talked like he was more machine than man. He had only taken a breath once in the past minute, explaining all his "Rejuvenation" projects.\n\nHis always present smile only widens as he says "Sorry but there's just so much to do!" Reaching down and taking a canteen from his vest pocket he takes a swig before going on "Denver in the hands of your people is a good start but now you need to make it yours, not just ruling over this scrap pile but making it something worth holding beyond the salvage."\n\nAndrea holds up a hand and says "I understand you have plans but I can't allow certain salvage to just be taken by anyone who finds it, we're the Brotherhood, we protect humanity from the dangers of technology."\n\nDan waves the flask in a dismissive gesture as he says "Yes yes, I know who I signed up with. I'm not talking about that, like I said this city needs to be a city again, not just some scrap heap that everyone is fighting over. You and your people can do that, you have the know how. How to make the factories run again, the streets safe, and how to keep the lights on. You don't want or need scavengers and raiders picking through the rubble, you need jobs that the people here can work."\n\nAndrea goes to say something back but before she can Dan points an almost accusing finger in her direction before interrupting her "You want the Brotherhood here to last? You need to have a strong capital, you need the people to want you around. Give them this city, this stability, and you'll be immovable."\n\nThe pointing finger turns to a fist that he raises high before he announces in a grandiose tone "Denver will be "The Jewel Of Colorado", known throughout the wasteland, along with the might of The Brotherhood of Steel!""

  nf_maxson.222.t:0 "Civilian Representation"
  nf_maxson.222.d:0 "Andrea waits a few moments to see if Dan has any more, but as he seems to have finally run out of words she asks "I can see your point Mr Rivers. We already have plans to restore certain sections of the city for our own use, but I believe what you propose goes beyond our means."\n\nDan sighs and lowers his fist as he says "I know. It's not something I expect to happen in the next few years, it could take decades." He takes another swig and goes on "But it's something that can be achieved with the right effort, and I'm willing to work for it if you'll have me. The Brotherhood can keep all the fancy tech if you can keep Colorado safe. Don't hide away from the world, and help the people here."\n\nInside her helmet Andrea ponders his final words for a moment before placing a hand on Dan's shoulder. "Very well Dan, you've been a help before and I believe you'll be a help still. I think your input will be needed in the coming months and years." Andrea says\n\nThe trader's smile gets ever wider as he makes finger guns for a moment, catches himself and does his best salute before saying "Keeping you afloat, as promised.""

  nf_maxson.23.t:0 "Preparing For A Promotion"
  nf_maxson.23.d:0 "Bringing the highest ranking members of the Expedition back to the Maxson Bunker had taken some time, but Andrea knew it was necessary. Her title as "Elder" was all but officially confirmed of course. After the victory over the Hangdogs none of her Brothers doubted her ability to lead.\n\n"I was right..." Andrea mused to herself, all her planning and strategies had been vindicated. It certainly hadn't been easy, but they had won.\n\nStanding in her quarters inspecting her self in the mirror, it felt strange being out of her powered armor. It had been a constant in her life since the retreat from Denver, and without the added height her perspective felt strange.\n\nSquaring her shoulders and smoothing some creases on her new robes of office Andrea stares into the reflection. On short notice she had at least managed to aquire an outfit fitting an Elder of the Brotherhood. It fit her well enough, the woman before her looked the part.\n\nTucking a stray hair behind her ear she nodded to herself. She was ready."

I will not allow the tragedies of the past define us. Our victories have proven this fact. Colorado will know the might of the Brotherhood forever more!" as Andrea shouts these last words she raises her fist high into the air.\n\nNot the traditional Elder induction speech but the reaction was instant, the gathered Brothers raises fists high with cheers and shouts of affirmation in response to her words.\n\nAndrea can feel the smile forming on her face, the pride swelling in her chest. They had trusted her, she couldn't ask for better Brothers to lead.\n\nAt the back of the room one of the doors leading in opened, and a Knight stumbled through. "Elder!" they shouted, barely audible over the celebratory shouts. Raising a hand for silence Andrea beckoned the Knight forward from behind the crown, "What is it Knight?""

The Knight explains.\n\nAndrea had the room cleared of all but the most senior Brothers, her hands on either side of the map they had brought out to help visualize what was being explained.\n\n"That's when they encountered this force?" Andrea asks as she taps on the map. "Yes Elder, Outsider says he hasn't seen a force of tribals that act this way. Well organised and in great numbers, all with matching armor. An army, is how he described it, not some raiding party."\n\nAndrea leans back and puts a hand to her chin. Another challenger for the dominance of Colorado, so soon after the Hangdogs. "We haven't had the time to secure our position here, but it's not like we have a choice." she thinks to herself, glancing back up towards the gathered Paladins and Knights.\n\n"So be it. We shall face this threat with all our strength. Send these barbarians back to their huts and show them this is our land. Ad Victoriam!" Andrea announces to her Brothers, who take up her cry."

She was leading a force back to the site of the Expeditions greatest failure, and she wasn't sure what to expect.\n\nWhen they had first arrived in the city Denver's Union Station seemed like a perfect location for them to settle into. Pre-war bomb shelters under the main building and a central location with easy access to the rest of the city. Also a perfect trap, for when the Hangdogs finally revealed themselves in force they poured in from every direction at once. Even with the Hangdogs routed and the city being swept clean of the bastards Andrea can't help but grip her rifle tighter as a shiver runs up her spine.\n\nSweeping the laser rifle's muzzle back and forth as they enter the platforms she hears audible gasps and more than a few curses spouted from the helmet speakers of those coming in behind her. Andrea steels herself and orders "Focus, we haven't cleared the area yet." Her voice remained level and calm, but inside she burned with anger."

Andrea was lucky enough to be in her armor when the attack came, and inside the station itself, but the Brothers who had been outside on the open air platforms were disoriented and overwhelmed before being torn to pieces. In some cases literally, with the massive hounds pulling or holding down men and women in their armor while the raiders went to work, cracking open the shells and butchering the new threat to their city-wide dominance.\n\nScattered about the battle scarred platforms are bodies, or pieces of them. Andrea can see at least two dozen power armored figures. Some are trapped under pieces of the station that fell on their bodies, but the rest are propped up in varius positions of sitting or standing.\n\nScrawled on their armor are symbols of the Hangdogs, howling men and dogs crudely drawn but recognizable. "A sign to any who came through here, that this was their doing." Andrea thinks to herself, teeth grinding together as her fury reaches a peak.\n\nShe wasn't sure if they would find their fallen Brothers here, of if they would have to scour the city for their holotags. The second option would have been preferable to this sight.\n\n"Collect them, all of them. Scrape those fucking drawings off their armor and try to identify them. Third squad with me, we're going into the station." Andrea orders, before stomping towards the entrance of the Union Station. If there was any question about it before this settled it. There would be no trace of the Hangdogs left in Colorado when they claimed it. "I won't allow them to get away with any of this." Andrea fumes to herself."

Stepping over the rubble strewn entrance Andrea sweeps the inside with her weapon, the squad moving in behind her. She remembers the panic when the explosions started, the rush to join the fight outside, the shocking speed of the raiders as they reached the building entrances and windows before most the Brotherhood had reacted.\n\nAndrea had only unslung her rifle when another volley of dynamite was thrown into the station itself. Not particulary deadly to those in powered armor, but those without the protective shell were blasted away or to pieces. Calling out for the Brothers around her to return fire she had pushed forward, using the bulk of her armor to shield those behind her.\n\nAndrea pauses in her recollection to crouch down and retrieve a drained micro fusion cell from the ground, holding it between her fingers. For all the firepower they could bring to bear, even as unorganized as they were, it wasn't enough. The Brothers around her had opened up with everything they had, laser, plasma, even some explosive weapons thrown or launched from weapons.\n\nSheer ferocity had won out over them, as Andrea and the others in armor around her had tried to shield the wounded, the howling raiders had pushed into the station with their hounds. It took only a few moments of frantic firing for the desperate defense to turn into a brawl."

Andrea's weapon was out of ammo but as she hit the eject on her current cell four men were on her, trying to topple her with their weight and momentum. The laser rifle was knocked out of her grip while she struggled to stay standing.\n\nShouting in anger she had punched the first one in his screaming face, the armored gauntlet slamming into his mouth and sending them spinning with a broken jaw. Pushing and lashing out at the other three she had heard, even through the roar of combat around her, the screams from Nathan. With another shove which sent her attackers staggering away she had glanced back to the scribe on the ground. One of the hounds had him by the throat as he struggled to fight it off, before with a loud sickening crunch his neck was snapped.\n\nAdrenaline pumping through her body she had kicked the dog away, sending it skittering with a yelp. All around her the screams of the fighting, the wounded, and the dying drowned out all but one voice. Elder Cameron using his suits speakers to shout out an order that made Andrea's hot blood run ice cold. "RETREAT!" was the order she heard, and the Brothers who could started to follow their leader out of the station, shooting, hacking, punching, kicking, doing whatever they could to carve a path.\n\nAndrea shakes her head back and forth to clear it before glancing down to the microfusion cell. Opening her hand she sees her hand unconsciously clenched and has crushed the outer casing, she drops it to the floor where she had left it all those months ago. They had taken their revenge, for everyone they lost. This would be their main base in Denver again, to erase the history of failure here they won't fall again.

Ostensibly, it was a Brotherhood Reconnaissance trooper, but judging from the reports, he was far more than that. \n\nIn the retreat from Denver him and few dozen men were separated by a raider ambush, and ended up at the wrong bunker entirely. It was a Pre-War rations stockhouse just south of Fort Lyon that had miraculously been mostly undisturbed since the bombs fell. \n\nSo, he and the men camped out inside it, got the bunker transmitter working, and put out an SOS signal prompting discovery by the rest of the Expedition. \n\nThat all seemed simple enough, but there was a number of peculiarities with the man himself. \n\nFirstly, his armor was heavily modified; sporting bandoliers, satchels, some kind of helmet mounted infrared scope, and mounts for a ghillie net. \n\nSecondly, he refused all requests at his actual name, and anybody he lead to the stockhouse revealed they didn't actually know it. Even his holotags had been tampered with to only display his favored nickname, "Outsider." \n\nThirdly was his manner of speech. He'd picked up something of a wastelander's accent and all of the informal dialect that came with it. \n\nWhilst Andrea was lost in thought about the man, he had been standing at an increasingly uncomfortable attention. "Need anything else, Miss-" \n\n "Paladin Commander." She corrected, there was no "Miss Brixley" in this bunker. \n\n"Sorry, Paladin Commander.

Some of the robotic chasis lifelessly slumped against the wall had names drawn on them, or colorful, almost artistic depictions of flowers, hearts, or Doki herself. \n\nOn the one hand, it could just be all faulty programming resultant from exposure to an unstable Artificial Intelligence....on the other these could have been as close to people as tin cans can get.

This had been the first chance he'd had to study something more advanced than a laser pistol, and study over it he did. He barely even noticed Andrea enter until she spoke, at which point he stood up a bit straighter, clearing his throat and motioning down at the terminal, rubbing his beard with a free hand. \n\n"Good Morning, Paladin Commander. This...terminal is incredibly unique. It's been modified many times over, especially in the RAM and CPU department. We could use it for calculations related to research, or production, but there is one issue..." \n\n"Yes, Proctor?" \n\nHe shifted his shoulders a bit, letting out a somber huff.

Today, Andrea and the good Proctor had been interviewing Baggers researchers on their ongoing projects, trying to determine which avenues of research were worth keeping, and which were worth scrapping. \n\nThis was especially annoying for Andrea, who had little mind for any pursuit of science that wasn't applicable to the battlefield, but Elrick seemed to be enjoying having full reign over their discoveries. \n\nThe first of the day had been the least impressive; Janey Badsall, an animal researcher, pitched her experiments on the hierarchies of Yao Guai native to Northern Colorado. It was quickly surmised that there were no Yao Guai native to Colorado, and this had been a long running scheme to gain and misuse research funding. She was asked to leave. \n\nSecondly was Peter Baleslift, a researcher attempting to pioneer the field of robotic prosthetics. The prosthetics themselves were impressive, but the backpack mounted reactors required to run them were not only heavy, but prone to causing cancer. He was asked to leave. \n\nThat left Wulf Kempor, a medicinal researcher who (to the surprise of Andrea and Elrick) had come up with something quite useful!

Still, if even half of this was built this may be the biggest Vault we now know of."\n\n"Anything relating to its purpose?"

Already to the south there are talks of armed resistance forming in response to our decision here, among the mutants and ghouls there. In addition, raiders prey on the weak, and our Brotherhood has began to splinter. Barnaky's new vision promises order, but at what cost? Will this union between man and machine save us, or will it damn us all? For now, I carry on, placing my trust in the strength of the Brotherhood—and the wisdom of those we've lost.""

A lone figure in battered, horned Midwestern Brotherhood power armor limps into view. Sections of their armor are scorched, and their plasma rifle drags slightly in their grip.\n\nThe figure approaches the empty cradle where the Calculator's systems once resided. With visible effort, they place a gloved hand on the console, their head bowing as if in mourning. After a long moment, they raise their rifle, firing bolts of plasma into the remains of the machinery. Sparks fly, and the screen flickers as the camera feed cuts to black.\n\nWhen the feed resumes, the figure is gone, leaving behind only the smoldering remains of the Calculator's chamber."

  nf_maxson_vault0.9.d:0 ""The Calculator is gone from here, but not forgotten. It is no longer a threat to the Brotherhood, nor a tool for any scavenger who stumbles across this place. We've removed the core systems to Bunker Epsilon, where its power will be directed under our control—or at least, that's what we tell ourselves."\n\n"General Barnaky's decision still haunts me. His transformation into the Calculator's sole organic overseer is a reminder of what we've sacrificed. He believed his wife's memory and his love for humanity justified his choice. But his vision of purity, of a 'better' world, is one forged in steel and blood. The mutants will suffer, the rebels will die, and the Brotherhood will rule. Is this the salvation we dreamed of?"\n\n"If you're listening to this, then perhaps there is still hope that someone will learn from our mistakes. Know that I fought for a future, even if it is a future I will never see. I was simply known as 'The Warrior,' and I am a proud Paladin of the Midwestern Brotherhood of Steel."\n\nThe holotape ends with an image of the Warrior saluting, their horned power armor gleaming in the chamber's dim light."

  nf_maxson_vault0.91.d:0 "Andrea stood in the hollowed-out chamber, her gaze lingering on the remains of cables and shattered machinery where the Calculator once rested. The silence that followed the final holotape was heavy, the words of the Warrior and Barnaky still echoing in her mind.\n\n"So… they moved it," Elrick said, breaking the quiet. He glanced at Andrea, his brow furrowed beneath his visor. "To Bunker Epsilon out east, no less. And no mechanical armies since? They must've contained it somehow. But… I don't understand. Why haven't we heard anything about this before?"\n\nBrixley crossed her arms, standing near the chamber's edge. "Because they don't want anyone to know," she said sharply. "You think it's a coincidence this place is sealed and forgotten? They're hiding it, Elrick. Whatever they've done with the Calculator, it's not for the good of the wasteland."\n\n"And yet, no hordes of robots marching from Epsilon," Elrick countered, gesturing at the empty cradle. "That machine was a monster, but maybe Barnaky's plan actually worked. Maybe they're using it to maintain order."\n\nAndrea shook her head, stepping toward the console where the Warrior's plasma scars still marked the metal. "Barnaky thought he could control the Calculator, make it a tool for peace. But the logs make it clear: the Midwest tore itself apart over his decision. Even if they're keeping it contained, it's a matter of time before it consumes them, too."\n\nElrick let out a long sigh. "So that's it, then? We leave it buried, pretend this place never existed?"\n\n"Yes," Andrea replied firmly. "The Brotherhood's future isn't tied to Barnaky's experiment. If we've learned anything today, it's that some decisions can't be undone."\n\nShe turned to the others. "Seal the chamber. Let the past stay buried here.""

  nf_maxson_boulderdome.1.d:0 "A crater, that's what most of Boulder is these days. Filled to the brim with bright green ghouls and pools of radioactive material that will irradiate you through power armor. It'd been something the expedition was aware of since shortly after it arrived, but complications with the hangdogs, then with the legion, and then with North Coloradians meant that it was always just out of reach. \n\nNow, as Andrea looked over the various reports prepared by Outsider, it finally became clear that a mission to the Dome could be sustained. It wouldn't be easy, safe, or simple; a forward base would have to be constructed, the ghouls would have to be cleared out, scavengers would need to be kept at bay...all of this wasn't even related to whatever inhabited the dome itself. Dangerous pre-war robots? Decaying superweapons? Toxic Chemicals? \n\nJust the thought made Andrea more uneasy than she'd been for a while...but better the Brotherhood opens the dome than anybody else."

  nf_maxson_boulderdome.2.d:0 "Andrea stood over the grand town hall of the so-called "Contact Camp." It had been one of the few places that ghouls and humans could trade in Glowbugs territory, as it was -mostly- radiation free. Clearing the ferals from Boulder wasn't an easy task, but the more sane ghouls had been an even harder task; many of the ghouls resenting the outskirts of the Dome being cordoned off from private scavengers, so concessions had to be made to avoid rebelliousness. Some ghouls would be offered paying positions for work sites within the irradiated zone; hauling and gathering material, removing radioactive waste, ditch-digging to keep them busy. Though initially a tense agreement, it seems that over time things had cooled down between the locals and the brotherhood."

The first of many small military outpost to be dotted in and around the Boulder Dome Exclusion Zone, or BDEZ for short.\n\n"So, this is it, huh?" Pondered the Recon Trooper aloud.\n\n"It doesn't look like much, but it's in an excellent position. We've had mutant dogs roaming through here since we arrived and this base has a commanding view of the whole area."\n\n"Suppose you're right, just wouldn't wanna be stuck up in a little radioactive homestead like this..."\n\nHe had a point, but there was enough radaway stockpiled in that base to get you through the first weeks of a second apocalypse. The Paladins inside would be fine so long as their tours here are kept short and spaced well apart."

  nf_maxson_final.1.d:0 "Andrea opened the door to her command room and took a seat behind her desk. Dropping the bundle of reports and sighing as she leans back and enjoys the comfortable chair.\n\nSitting back up after a few moments she takes a look at the first report. Dan Rivers was making his way through the former territories the Legion had controlled, making contact with the communities there.\n\nPutting that sheet aside she picked up the next one, Outsider was "missing" again, probably heading north or east to try and find more information about the Midwestern Brotherhood. "Not something to worry about, he's made it through everything so far, just like the rest of us." She thinks to herself.\n\nThe next report is from Proctor Elrick, now Head Scribe Elrick. Mostly the latest on the confiscation and stockpiling of technology in the occupied areas. Andrea knows he has his work cut out for him just in Colorado, but the new Chapter needs a man of his experience to help deal with anything that might crop up.\n\nSmiling to herself Andrea reflects back on the trials they've all endured to get to this moment. Her leadership had brought them from the brink of destruction to being a major power in the Wasteland.\n\nThere would be more to do of course, but for now she allowed herself to relax."
