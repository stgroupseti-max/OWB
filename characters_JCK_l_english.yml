    JCK_NEIL_JACKSON_DESC:0 "§9"Time may have passed, but the fire within us has never waned. The memory of the slaughter still haunts us, fueling our determination to build a better future. We will never forget the bloodshed, and we will ensure that no one else does either."§!\n\nThe Jacksons were the greatest of Missoula's First families before the Enclave came. Like many, they welcomed the Enclave at first. But when the Colonel's taxes and censorship proved too much, Neilus Jackson organized a petition to challenge their oppression. For their treason the Jacksons were pushed east to the badlands, where a family that survived the Great War subsists as little more than raiders. Now they are a threat to all the Northern Commonwealth, and a reminder to Montana why the Colonel is always right."

    JCK_WYEJ_JACKSON_DESC:0 "§7“Well, you see, you build here, crack them there...”§!\n§c“Well, what about the snacks?”§!\n§7“Shut up, stupid!”§!\n\nOlder Jacksons, before the Enclave’s slaughter, told tales of some of the kids getting lost in the forest and never being seen again. It looks like they somehow made it out to the Midwest and started their own Families! Even joined up with their own kind of Wardens- the Texas Rangers, they call ‘em.  Word of our plight reached them, and some of their sons found their way home! They are a silly bunch, but they bring great ideas from their time with those Rangers on better supplying and training our special forces, as well as improving them all around! Although some family members grow tired of their objections to raiding activities."

    JCK_ERASTUS_JACKSON_NAME:0 "Erastus Jackson"
    JCK_ERASTUS_JACKSON_DESC:0 "My wonderful son, beloved by all our relatives especially his brother Jarett, and although he clashes with my daughters, he is integral to our dynamic with Wyoming, gone a bit native though. "

    JCK_MARIE_JACKSON_NAME:0 "Marie Jackson"
    JCK_MARIE_JACKSON_DESC:0 "Marie Jackson, one of my two wonderful daughters, about the only one of us still sane I'd say. Kept her dignity throughout our expedition, and truthfully? Has kept us from committing terrible things in the name of revenge. She is the heart and soul of us folk, without her we'd likely be more than bloodthirsty cannibalistic raiders- though her and Libby often butt heads on this. Not to mention shes about the best sniper we have, our old Warden guard himself taught her before our exodus, and she still carries that spirit, encouraging other members to take up the rifle in the name of not revenge, but establishment of democracy once again against tyrants. But even she understands we must do what it takes to get by, even if raiding is beneath us."

    JCK_LIBBY_JACKSON_NAME:0 "Libby Jackson"
     JCK_LIBBY_JACKSON_DESC:0 "Libby Jackson, one of my two wonderful daughters, a genius, smart as a whip. With her big ol' brain she's showed us how to survive out here, although quite different from scavenging, raiding is great! Especially with all the new members Libby's convinced to join us, it has become especially fruitful, even if we're using most of em' for revenge. Even though she's not a blood, I love her just as much as her siblings- we picked her up on our exodus from Missoula, a crying child in the burning streets, we know not of her heritage, but she is a Jackson all the same, she wishes our generous spirit to spread, in the name of revenge against those who destroyed us. Although her love of raiding and manipulation makes me somewhat worried."
