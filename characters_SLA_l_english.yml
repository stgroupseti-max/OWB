    SLA_VEGEIR_DESC:0 "Vegeir, a man of imposing stature, continues to serve at the helm of the Slags, serving in the image of the Chosen One who visited them and ensured peace ruled the day back in 2241. But it has been over 30 years since that day, and Vegeir is half the man he used to be. His imposing stature is only possible because of the poor postures of the rest of the Slags, while his once cat-like movements have been reduced to lumbering gestures.\n\nAlthough technically capable of venturing onto the surface, Vegeir, along with the majority of the Slags, still harbor a deep fear of the irradiated world above, exacerbated by the physical afflictions caused by exposure to sunlight. However, the community's machinery, crucial for their survival, requires maintenance and replacement parts that Modoc, the nearby town, cannot provide. With their stockpiles dwindling, Vegeir now finds himself at odds with Marina and her guerilla forces, who see an opportunity to bolster their independence and reform the symbol of a broken star that, to Vegeir, fell free from their chains so long ago.\n\nRecognizing Modoc's stagnant state, Vegeir believes it is time to share their advanced farming techniques and construction knowledge with the townspeople. By imparting this wisdom, they hope to uplift Modoc's capabilities and forge a stronger alliance, drawing inspiration from the tribal from Arroyo who once saved them in their darkest hour in the time when life was uncertain. Vegeir's vision extends beyond the immediate needs of his own people, seeking to foster progress and cooperation in the above-ground world they now partly call home.\n\nWith Vegeir's commanding presence and unwavering dedication to the well-being of his community, the Slags have found a leader who embodies both strength and compassion. Vegeir's strategic thinking and desire for mutual growth guide their interactions with the outside world, keeping the spirit of the Chosen One alive in their hearts. Yet he may be getting too old for leadership, and it may come time for a new, younger, face to take the reigns, should Vegeir prove lacking."
