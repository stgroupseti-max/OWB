  DUN_JAKOB_NAME:0 "Jakob Dundurn"
  DUN_JAKOB_DUNDURN_DESC:0 "Jakob Dundurn, regent of the Dundurn fortune, former Grand Electorate, and magnate of arms. Jakob has a shadow that it seems he cannot escape from, the loss of Stoon to a simpleton wastelander. The Dundurns held onto the title of Governer for 95 of the 145 years of elections and now Jakob and lost it all. What's worse is rumblings from the other Electorals of reform, revolt, and escape, should any of these pieces fall to Jakob's disadvantage the long running power of the Dundurns might finally come crashing down."

  nf_dun.1.t:0 "Chase v. Dundurn: Humanity"
  nf_dun.1.d:0 "DUNDURN: And what of your metal men, Mrs. Chase? Do you think the people of Dundurn want them to be their successors? I can't name a man who would gladly let a walking skeleton take his place, let alone leave his own flesh and blood to become one! \n\nCHASE: It is not 'succession' that my work provides, Mr. Dundurn. It is transcendence. The human form is subsceptible, unevolved for the horrors of the modern world. For every great mind, ten more meet their end to what lay beyond this stage. The background radiation. The Blizzards. The men of Bank End. These are all common threads, Mr. Dundurn— foes that we can surpass merely through body. \n\nDUNDURN: And why, pray tell, must we forsake our flesh to do so? Can we not force this 'evolution' you speak of? Is it so farfetched to have faith in the body? \n\nCHASE: You would find yourself hard-pressed trying to play God, Mr. Dundurn. Unlike what you propose, my work does not preclude unity: after all, it is your goons that pester Dr. Toboggan's asylums and lurk around the Pleasantdale woods, do they not?"
  nf_dun.1.a:0 "The Debate Continues"

  nf_dun.100.t:0 "Chase v. Dundurn: Humanity Cont'd"
  nf_dun.100.d:0 "DUNDURN: In Dundurn, we believe every man to be equal. Super Mutants and Fairies are abominations, undeserving of even a passing glance. Mrs. Chase, I shouldn't have to say that those men do not represent my endeavors, but I will let the record show this: they have certainly served the people of Dundurn more than you. It takes action, not words, to stir the hearts of a people. \n\nCHASE: Your advocacy is as damning as it is amusing. I have found that for any form of civilized philanthropy to have meaning it must be without callousness: unmasked by greed. Your work details a plan to subvert the human error, to create an immortal being beyond fault. Such a thing is not motivated by the common good: it is mere arrogance, the idea that you and those who follow you are deserving of standing above the downtrodden. When I speak of transcendence, I speak with an equal latitude: the future of humanity is not with broken cells and maddened science, but by cautious expansion of the human design. \n\nDUNDURN: Your words circle with irony. A man who chooses to follow a man who has achieved immortality is a man deserving of a future. It takes a visionary to identify a visionary, Mrs. Chase, and unlike you, I believe in the ability of man to discern truth from lie. Why should a man forsake his flesh for some silly prattle when he could merely boost his own? To keep ones soul is to keep ones conscience. This is a basic law of nature."
  nf_dun.100.a:0 "Jakob's points resonated well with the aristocrats."
  nf_dun.100.b:0 "Mrs. Chase's ascension ideals prevailed."

  nf_dun.4.t:0 "The Ghost of Dundurn"
  nf_dun.4.d:0 "Everyone has a Catcher story. \n\nHis namesake serves as a cautionary tale for grown men and women alike; 'watch what you say, or whose shoes you step on, and the Catcher will look the other way.'  Always masked.  Always on the move.  Armed lighter than the average mercenary but thrice as deadly, Catcher rings a heavy price for a guaranteed hit.  But the caps are never wasted on a Catcher hit.  He cleans up good, rendering camps, rooms, and halls dead quiet. \n\nLike the old sign says: 'Dirty Deeds Dundurn Cheap.'"
  nf_dun.4.a:0 "I sure don't wanna be on his bad side!"

  nf_dun_catcher_tooltip:0 "§RCatcher can be utilized in your decisions to raise compliance and lower resistance in occupied states.§!"

  nf_dun.5.t:0 "Remember The Union"
  nf_dun.5.d:0 "The year was 2243. Though rails had been built throughout the Electorate— some mere restorations of a shadow of some pre-war network— they were nowhere near how they were today. After a day of dining with the Chase family in Pleasantdale, he waited at the station for four hours before his train came. \n\nThey were the most grueling four hours of his life. Overnight, he made calls to every factory magnate within the Electorate, promising to double their fortunes with his new propositon, and what did they do? They laughed in his face. \n\nSo he said to himself, "I will do it myself." He issued a new notice to every working man and woman in Dundurn: "double your salary, double your pay— sign up with the Union today!" \n\nWithin weeks, he had mobilized the people into a new railway union. Even today, the Electoral Rail Union operates— laying tracks everywhere they can, so that you can get where you need to be when you need to be there!"
  nf_dun.5.a:0 "Bless our workers!"

  nf_dun.6.t:0 "Like Thieves in the Night"
  nf_dun.6.d:0 "Strange thugs broke into an asylum transport last night, stealing a considerable amount of patients from us— including Lugnut's grandmother. \n\nThough details are scarce, top mutants have been assigned to look into the matters. Further details will be brought directly to the good doctor's attention first and foremost."
  nf_dun.6.a:0 "Who could do such a thing?"

  nf_dun.7.t:0 "Rosewood Requests Entry"
  nf_dun.7.d:0 "The Rosewood Foundation has reached out with the hopes to join The Second Coalition. Shall we allow them entry, or turn them away?"
  nf_dun.7.a:0 "We will welcome them open-armed."
  nf_dun.7.b:0 "They'll need to look elsewhere!"


  nf_dun.8.t:0 "The Coalition Rejects Rosewood!"
  nf_dun.8.d:0 "Despite the good intentions of Gloria Chase and the Rosewood Foundation, the Second Coalition of Manitoba has turned their backs to their northern neighbors. No doubt a controversial decision will only serve to aid the growing tension between the powers..."
  nf_dun.8.a:0 "I suppose this changes things."

  nf_dun.9.t:0 "A City Hidden in the Smog"

  nf_dun.10.t:0 "Animal Trials"
  nf_dun.10.d:0 "Many animals were tested upon in the Dundurn Serum tests: at first, Radrats, then Wolves, even Umbravores and Frostlurks— with only the last two surviving. \n\nThe serums effects were repeatable. The veins and skin of a creature would blacken, as if a sort of accelerated rot kicked in before the observor's very eyes: something between ghoulification and death, an almost bizarre side-avenue, a circumvention of what is known. No doubt the DNA replicator had something to do with it... Perhaps, then, it was an imperfection in the machine? Or perhaps we are misusing it..?"
  nf_dun.10.a:0 "We have no time to find out."

  nf_dun.11.t:0 "The First Human is Tested"
  nf_dun.11.d:0 "Travis Billings was the first to step up when Jakob Dundurn called for a volunteer. He was a factory worker, galvanized by the Littlehope Doctrine and now a devout follower of Dundurn's promises of immortality. To the science team, he was more than ready, and even more qualified. \n\nAfter weeks of preparation, the trial began. They placed him into the DNA Replicator, and adjusted its values as best they could. What followed was thirty seconds of horror: the sound of bones cracking accompanied and at times even overwrote Billings own screams, the light of chamber blinding any who dared to take a look. Even as the realization of what they had done had grown within their souls, they did not waver. They had come too far. \n\nWhen Travis emerged, his eyes glowed with the power of the replicator, and his skin was half-rotten from the energy— he was a dead man, but he walked all the same. When they asked how he was, he spoke only in grunts, but understood the scientists demands perfectly. There was a disturbing glee to him, a sort of childish giddiness that unnerved even Dundurn..."
  nf_dun.11.a:0 "This is no perfect man."
  nf_dun_first_zombie_tt:0 "§YTravis Billings§! will be available as a §Gunit leader!§!"

  nf_dun.12.t:0 "Corina's Dream"
  nf_dun.12.d:0 "Years ago, a bunker containing a Chinese war machine was unearthed in Pleasantdale during the construction of its immense water purification plant— the machine half-constructed and mostly intact, given its two-hundred years of waiting. The machine was studied by a graduate from Chase University, Corina Lone, who believed it could be finished with amicable effort from one of the industrial powers, but no matter who she approached, she was scorned and laughed at. "Where are you going to get the power for that thing?" one asked, "Do you trust that thing to protect you and your family?" another asked. When Littlehope's doctrines came through, her idea seemed to be shelved... \n\nUntil Gloria Chase became aware of her studies. Though her husband was less than enthused by the childish idea of "building a giant robot to destroy our enemies," she knew the value in her College and wanted to see Corina succeed. Now, with the Rosewood Foundation in charge, it could be done... But resources would need to be secured. Such a structure would not come without heavy prices."
  nf_dun.12.a:0 "The way forward is paved with steel, not blood."

  nf_dun.13.t:0 "Trouble in Dundurn!"
  nf_dun.13.d:0 "Rumors circulate that General Pariah Hawkmoon of Dundurn has begun to amass a new generation of soldiers, built from the old and in with many of the Electorate's poor. "No doubt," says a Stoon socialite, "these are the consequences of Timothy Littlehope's teachings in full swing." \n\nTime will tell what becomes off General Hawkmoon and her army— in the meantime, all the world can do is watch."
  nf_dun.13.a:0 "Let's see what you're made of."

  nf_dun.14.t:0 "A Message from Dundurn"
  nf_dun.14.d:0 "A messenger from Dundurn came into the Kingdom today, carrying a large bag that clattered of steel. Though his confidence was evident in his stroll, it faded as he came before the Duke himself. There upon the ground he let a broken Knight's helmet clatter, itself meekly polished, yet intentionally dented— a message from afar. \n\nOn the helmet, carved into its side, were five words: "From Pariah Hawkmoon with love.""
  nf_dun.14.a:0 "§RThey know not what they have wrought.§!"

  nf_dun.15.t:0 "Chase v. Dundurn: Dandies"
  nf_dun.15.d:0 "DUNDURN: Something needs to be done about Pierre Solomon and his bootlicking guppies in Stoon. He has destroyed the very sacred nature of our elections, and therefore undermined the good faith of the people! \n\nCHASE: As I recall, it was you who lost the seat Dundurn had held for over a century, Mr. Dundurn. Don't you think that is reason enough to cast doubt over your tenure? \n\nDUNDURN: <snickering> And I suppose you don't find it suspicious in the slightest that I lost out to cannibal whoremongers? Come now, Ms. Chase. It really isn't hard to see if you pay attention. \n\nCHASE: I am paying plenty, and from what I can see, you are a failure too afraid to admit it. The people of Dundurn do not want you anymore. Your dynasty is ending, and you are the first victim of your family's ineptitude. It is perfectly natural to react as you have, frightened and screaming against the turning tides. It is a shame that it does not validate your cause. \n\nDUNDURN: The Dandies are circus freaks. Do you trust them to rule over us with a fair and just hand, Ms. Chase? \n\nCHASE: The people of Dundurn have no need to fear the Dandies. Do you know why? Because they are in Stoon, Mr. Dundurn, and we are not. No man or woman in Dundurn has ever had Dandy teeth graze their neck, but you know what they have experienced? Choking smog, poor working conditions, unethical and unfair wage-changes— these are our plagues, Mr. Dundurn. Not savages in suits."
  nf_dun.15.a:0 "The elections were rigged by Dandies!"
  nf_dun.15.b:0 "The Dandies were not Dundurn's concern!"

  nf_dun.16.t:0 "Dundurn: Bootlickers"
  nf_dun.16.d:0 "I have always despised them. The Bootlickers. The Yes-Men. The sycophants suckling from the teats of successful men, throwing themselves into a fire pit without meaning, or worse, chipping away like pirahnas at the feet of the great. \n\nI watched as my father collapsed under the weight of his own idiocy thanks to these men. For a man to be strong, to be truly intelligent, he must be held up by those of equal strength, equal mind. Gloria Chase wanted to make the world one, but she failed to realize that man was stronger apart. You may tell a man's candor by his handshake: be it firm, his aims are serious, and his passion undeniable. Be they weak, they crave no good, and may be cast aside accordingly. \n\nA man who can stand on his own, a man who can pull himself up by his own bootstraps, a man who could carry the weight of the world on his back— that is the kind of man you should become for those you love."
  nf_dun.16.a:0 "Death to Yes Men!"

  nf_dun.17.t:0 "Chase: The Greatest Dawn to Ever Grace Humankind"
  nf_dun.17.d:0 "When I was a girl, the trains did not run. The power flickered and water ran short every other day. My father died of tuberculosis, and I was left with a mother who was lost, a sheep with no shepherd to guide her. \n\nMy work has always been to promote the common welfare of mankind; to push us forward into a time where we can be better to one another. If not just for ourselves, but for whom we love most. From Pleasantdale to Dundurn, I have spoken to them all: rich partygoers and steel factory workers. Do you know what they all had in common? Sorrow. Regret. Depression. \n\nThe human mind is flawed. Like a broken record, we are doomed to this horrible, horrible cycle where we do nothing but repeat our mistakes time and time again, and we cry over it because we cannot understand our own failings. That, my friends, is why I created the Rosewood Foundation: so that you and I may transcend our earthly mistakes. It is in righteous steel that we shall be united: no more shall there be such petty distinctions such as ghoul or smoothskin, mutant or man, or even man or woman. The future of the world is just over the horizon, a golden sunset by which we shall prepare for the greatest dawn to ever grace humankind."
  nf_dun.17.a:0 "Amen."
  nf_dun.17.b:0 "Was this meant to be cute?"

  nf_dun.18.t:0 "Dundurn: Are You Afraid, Dundurn?"
  nf_dun.18.d:0 "Hark, beloved people of Dundurn— I would have a few words with you all, if you do not mind. \n\nFor decades our fair country has pushed the Electorate forward with our own progress. It was Dundurn steel that elevated the muppets in Stoon from mere fishes-out-of-water into the petty sycophants that now share our border. It was Dundurn tax money that paid for the Asylum in Wakaw and all of its stolen medicines. It was the genius of Dundurn scientists that kept the lights on in Pleasantdale. The Electorate has reeked of our might for generations, and what now? Pierre Solomon sits atop his own high tower, giggling at our disenfranchised and turning his nose up high against our interests. \n\nWe are the men and women that hold this pathetic collection of states upon our backs. It is our mind, our brawn, our might that has kept the enemies of this great nation at bay. Who was it, again, who stopped Leshy dead in her tracks? Was it Solomon, weeping over his lost caps? No! It was Pariah Hawkmoon, our most fearless soldier. Where is her statue in Stoon, I wonder? Where is her statue, Pierre? \n\n*Loud booing and cheers can be heard. In the garbled audio, a curse directed at Pierre Solomon can be heard.*\n\nWe live in spite of our neighbors. In spite of our enemies. Our hatred is but a reflection of our passion, our love for all that is good. We shall push ever onwards into the future with nary a fear in our hearts! Though our enemies may openly spit upon us, to have our revenge, first we must rejoice. To laugh in the face of darkness is to be fearless. \n\nSo tell me, then, people of Dundurn, are you afraid?"
  nf_dun.18.a:0 "He's speaking my language!"
  nf_dun.18.b:0 "His radical outlook disturbs me."

  nf_dun.19.t:0 "A Message from Vernon Duquesne"
  nf_dun.19.d:0 "Hey there, \n\nI wanted to thank you personally for your choice in allowing the Duquesne family to handle your matters. For years, we have prided ourselves on dealing with the rabble. Now, I'm not the kind of schmuck to get involved in politics, so I'm not keen on where you stand on all this mumbo-jumbo, but if you ask me... I'd bruise a thousand of these pricks if it meant they figured out what the hell their job really is. You know what I mean?\n\nDon't bite off more than you can chew, don't bite the hand that feeds... That kind of stuff. Dumb motherfuckers have it coming, time and time again. 'Course, their bitching makes my business, don't it? Keep in touch. I'm always around. \n\nV.D."
  nf_dun.19.a:0 "Thanks?"

  nf_dun.20.t:0 "Chase v. Dundurn: The Kingdom"
  nf_dun.20.d:0 "DUNDURN: Since you have such great opinions, Mrs. Chase, why don't we talk about Manitoba? \n\nCHASE: If you refer to the bloody history we share with them, I've little interest in such qualms beyond how Dundurn may benefit. \n\nDUNDURN: Little interest? Do you mean to imply that the deaths of many Dundurn regulars doesn't matter to you? \n\nCHASE: It is not my business whether a man chooses to go to war, Mr. Dundurn— only that I may equip him with the finest so that he may accomplish his mission as best as possible. Last I recall, during the war, your family failed to supply many of our originals with proper supply, instead hogging the materials produced from the Dundurn war machine for personal interests. \n\nDUNDURN: Blatant slander! Eighty-five percent of all that was made in those facilities were shuffled to the front lines immediately. The rest were taken to satellite sites so that they could be kept on-hand. If we wish to discuss the matter of wastefulness and greed, Mrs. Chase, allow me to return the favor and bring up the controversies surrounding your Rosewood Foundation. A non-profit organization dedicated to what, reinventing mankind? Have you forgotten the city you are in? \n\nCHASE: No; this city is all too painful a reality to ever forget, Mr. Dundurn. And yes, Rosewood comes out of my own coffers to which I can manage, though we are not entirely non-profit. We lend our services to those who need an educated mind. \n\nDUNDURN: And who would these 'people' be, exactly? Does your Dundurn-based operation lend itself to Pleasantdale royalties? \n\nCHASE: No, actually. We help the poor, and allow them to pay us on their terms. We take offers and operate off of them accordingly. \n\nDUNDURN: So you've regressed to petty bartering? \n\nCHASE: No. We've adopted common sense."
  nf_dun.20.a:0 "Dundurn's genius drags her again!"
  nf_dun.20.b:0 "She helped me fix a broken pipe in my house!"

  nf_dun.21.t:0 "The Dundurn Regulars"
  nf_dun.21.d:0 "Years ago, the Dundurn regulars held the line against Manitoban influence. We may have once been a part of their kingdom, but we've never wanted it. The smog and ash here may be choking, but it is ours— and we'll fight anyone tooth and nail to keep it that way. \n\nOur soldiers wear the steel of their knights as tokens of mockery and for their own protection. This iconography strikes a fear into our enemies, the sort one would feel seeing their friends skin on someone else's body, and for that we wear it with pride. Let them know that we stand for freedom above monarchs. \n\nPariah Hawkmoon herself is perhaps the most infamous of these regulars, standing both against King and Snake with a raging confidence that most men can only hope to strive for."
  nf_dun.21.a:0 "Our army stands strong."

  nf_dun.22.t:0 "Dundurn Munitions"
  nf_dun.22.d:0 "Were it not for the foundries in Dundurn, there would be far less gusto to the militants within the Electorate. Try as Pleasantdale may to not have a standing army, our influence rots their people and so they seek out guns for their own protection and even to merely collect. Following old pre-war designs and schematics dating back to the 20th century retro-fitted with modern lasers and plasma, our weapons are among some of the most unique in western Canada— and while they may not always be regaled with standards of quality, our ability to supply is nigh-unmatched this side of the Winnipegosis."
  nf_dun.22.a:0 "A thousand bullets for every man!"

  nf_dun.23.t:0 "The Future is Upon Us"
  nf_dun.23.d:0 "The results are in! The winner of the people's hearts is..."
  nf_dun.23.a:0 "Jakob Dundurn. As though it could be any other."
  nf_dun.23.b:0 "Gloria Chase. Her genius will fund innovation unseen."

  nf_dun.24.t:0 "Pariah Hawkmoon's Big Day"
  nf_dun.24.d:0 "Pariah and her Sparkblades gathered outside the old Fairy Glen, where Leshy dared to dwell. Lighting her favorite brand of cigarette, she stared into the mouth of the old MANIFEST facility sinkhole, holding yet another stick of dynamite. "If it ain't broke..." she said, tossing it down into the pit on top of a pile. "Don't fix it." she turned, "Let's wrap this up, folks." \n\nAfter a time, they blew the fuse— burying Leshy in her own den. \n\nThough the official story was she was dead, Pariah knew better than to expect anything without proof. To her, it was simple: if she survived, she ain't gonna be a problem in our lifetimes, and that was enough for her."
  nf_dun.24.a:0 "The hawk always gets the snake, in the end."

  nf_dun.25.t:0 "Honoring Our Finest"
  nf_dun.25.d:0 "With the fall of Leshy, a great threat to the peoples of the Katch has been eradicated. Today, we honor both the brave heroes who marched to Leshy's den, and those who fell in her wake with a memorial. \n\nLet it be reiterated, then, that Dundurn has and always will be a place to grow: where business is, and shall always be, the mightiest law."
  nf_dun.25.a:0 "Amen."

  nf_dun.26.t:0 "Rewarding the Sparkblades"
  nf_dun.26.d:0 "Jakob considered his options; with the cannibals in Stoon and the freaks in Pleasantdale sorted out he now held the power that had been stolen from him, however he found himself without an electorate to be elected by. That wasn't exactly the end of the world, he had bigger fish to fry after all but there was an image to be considered. This had led him to ponder the state of the Sparkblades.\n\nThey'd been invaluable during the battles to secure dominance, and it would be wise to give their best positions of leadership in the Dundurn military. Keep them in house as it were. There was another option however, granting Strasbourg to Lugnut and his men to be its rulers while still being beneath Jakob's influence. It would be a good faith reward after all their aid and at least maintain the illusion that an electorate still existed."
  nf_dun.26.a:0 "Let them loose."
  nf_dun.26.b:0 "Keep them close."
