  ### Characters
  WPG_steele_name:0 "Eloi Steele"
  WPG_steele_desc:0 "Any good revolution needs heroes, and for those who would lay the foundation of the Three Rivers Republic that hero was Eloi Steele. Though the revolution did not manage to topple the crown entirely, the birth of the Republic was assured nonetheless. Eloi Steele fought, led and bled on the frontlines to see that birth through, and when the time came to choose a leader the people chose her to be their president.\n\nFiery, bold, and unafraid to roll up her sleeves, the new president has her work cut out for her. There are many both within and without the government who'd rather she was out of the picture for their own gain and the newborn republic faces its share of growing pains. She'll have to navigate the battlefields of politics wisely while also preparing for the inevitable return of the crown."
