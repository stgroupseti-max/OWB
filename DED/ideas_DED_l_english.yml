  ded_idea_rooted_desc:0 "First day on the Nebraska Territories assignment.\nDr. Atohi was visibly surprised when the DoD reached out to the Office for assistance - they don't usually take unreality research seriously. I suppose whatever's happening out here is anomalous enough to warrant our attention. Still no formal briefing. Just a coordinates drop and a "pack for long-term deployment" notice. Promising start."

  ded_idea_psychic_influence_desc:0 "The Big MT delegation continues to be... difficult.\nThe Office still doesn't understand why the DoD contracted them in the first place. Their methodology is slapdash at best, and they seem more focused on fast-tracking their teleportation grant than adhering to any kind of replicable science - let alone ethics.\nDr. Atohi's gateway framework offers a far more stable model: two-way transit, scalable, and grounded in observable phenomena.\nTeleportation is a one-way ticket with no return address. But of course, it's flashier, and the brass love flashy."

  ded_idea_monsters_desc:0 "Another formal complaint from Ethics. Can't say I blame them.\nThe DoD greenlit the Pine Ridge eviction orders without so much as a consultation. It reeks of damage control - like they know, or suspect, that they caused the incursion and are trying to bury it under concrete.\nStill, the gateway project nears completion. Dr. Atohi is tentatively projecting an October activation window. We're on schedule. For better or worse."
