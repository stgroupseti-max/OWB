  #DED_warrior_name:0 "The Warrior"
  #DED_warrior_desc:0 "To the surface it appears that the Deadline is an disorganized hive of rot. However, deep below in its tunnels something even greater lies, something more powerful than even §GThe Warrior§!. Whatever it is, it seems that the §Rnightmares are just the beginning."
  DED_wanamingo_queen_name:0 "The \"Wanamingo Queen\""
  DED_wanamingo_queen_desc:0 "Her coming is heralded by a rhythm that cannot be silenced, a pulsing thrum that vibrates through the air like the heartbeat of a wounded world. It resonates deep, beneath the ribs and into the marrow, a sound that is felt more than heard—felt in the jaw, the spine, the quaking earth itself. The Disjunction tore the seams of creation wide, and through the breach, she stepped like a dancer through the veil, her every motion heavy with meaning, her every step a ripple that warps all it touches.\n\nTo some, she is Anúŋkite Wíyąka, the godmother of rebirth, summoned by the Ghost Dance to rend the invader's world and return the old ways to the land. To others, she is Lamashtu, a shadow of primordial vengeance, a curse whispered in fear. To most, however, she is known simply as the \"Wanamingo Queen\".\n\nNow, the barrier is gone. What held her has shattered, and what once kept the world whole is no more. The beat is hers to command, the rhythm hers to devour. Whispers rise like smoke, carried on winds that no longer blow true. They know her only as the void's herald, the breaker of steps, the presence in the spaces where no light dares dwell.\n\nShe does not take—she becomes, and all else becomes her."
