  DED_timed_wargoals_desc:0 "The ground trembles beneath my feet—not from fear, but from the ceremonial dance that echoes through concrete slabs. I breathe the dust of this boundary, feeling sharply that every grain remembers the steps of those who came before me—those who tried to break past the limits, but became rooted in the sand.\n\nThe ghost dance never ends. It's born in the body, like a truth that cannot be hidden, and it only dies where memory grows heavier than air itself. I hear the land call a name—not mine, but still I answer.\n\nTo escape here is to tear free from fate itself. But can you ever escape if reality is woven from these borders? Every circuit of concrete is another life, cut short on the edge of light. I walk, but the road leads only deeper into myself."
  DED_wargoals:0 "Claiming The Site"
  DED_wargoals_desc:0 "I've watched people try to root themselves here—they scatter salt, whisper their spells, trace circles in the sand. They believe truth only grows where you can touch the earth. But this land waits for no one. It remembers more names than it can bear.\n\nTime drags like an old wound. Each day is another ritual, but none bring relief. The wind carries foreign voices, and it feels as if even the air knows I am an outsider.\n\nI claim this site, but the site has already claimed me. Its roots reach deeper than we can know. Here, between the sun and the void, truth always sinks into the sand."
  DED_wargoals_2:0 "Crush Omaha"
  DED_wargoals_2_desc:0 "The horizon burns like an old prophecy—forgotten, yet still alive in the shadows. Omaha feels like a mirage, a city that can't recall who built it. I raise my hand to break it, but realize I'm not breaking walls, but my own reflection in their cracks.\n\nThe old dances taught us to carry within us the song of destruction and renewal—to destroy a city is to release the truth buried under layers of borrowed names. Sometimes, you must break the temple to hear the earth's voice.\n\nI am no enemy, but here, memory itself becomes the foe. Every stone sings of a past that no longer is. In breaking Omaha, I am only trying to find an exit from the circle."
  DED_wargoals_3:0 "More Meat"
  DED_wargoals_3_desc:0 "Flesh appears where once there was only an idea—as if the world's desires become real only when someone breathes them in. I watch as new meat pulses through the sand, not asking whose it is.\n\nCeremonies summon something more than food or life. They call forth a hunger for truth, one that cannot be sated by any body. In each ritual is the echo of old famines, when the earth demanded tribute, not mercy.\n\nI seek a way out, but the body pulls toward the land. Maybe more meat is just another answer to a question no one dares ask aloud."
  DED_wargoals_4:0 "Western War"
  DED_wargoals_4_desc:0 "Everything seems different in the West—the sun cuts your eyes, the air thick with strange prayers. Here, war is not battle, but a path to cleansing, a chance to leave lies behind.\n\nI stand on the border where the earth still remembers the names of the dead. The western wind carries salt and ash, and each breath is a confession. I think of the dances that might cleanse the sky, if only someone dared to perform them.\n\nMaybe war is just another ritual. The West calls me to leave, but I am still searching for a truth that no one can carry away."
  DED_wargoals_5:0 "The Deadline Awakens"
  DED_wargoals_5_desc:0 "The border was silent—a forgotten song that lived beneath the skin. But now it's awake: I feel the rhythm beneath my soles, hear concrete speak a language no one ever learned.\n\nThis awakening is not a birth, but a return. I stand in the center of the circle, and all that once was me fades at the edge. If I could escape, I'd dissolve like a voice in the wind. But the border holds, because the border is me.\n\nThe ritual is finished, but I am still here. Maybe to truly leave, you must first become part of this land. Or maybe a piece of this land has long ago become me."
