  MTR_rail_riders_desc:0 "The Mad Trains are more a loose coalition of related families than a united force, with each of those clans based on one of the great pre-war train engines that still roam the rails. Those engines are individual in more than one way, as they all contain a unique AI that act as the driver for each train. This has made for a diverse group of peoples with many ways of solving problems but as many differing opinions on what is a problem."

  RMT_four_forefathers:0 "The Four Fathers"
  RMT_four_forefathers_desc:0 "Our predecessors built monuments to the Four Fathers, structures we can never hope to exceed. But they also turned their backs on what the Four Fathers stood for and were in turn blindsided by nuclear fire. In their mercy we have been given a second chance as our tribe is headed by the avatars of their teachings. \n\nWe must §Rreclaim§! §4Mount Rushmore§! before we lose the gods' favor a second time."

  RMT_four_forefathers_2_desc:0 "Once more, we stand in the shadow of the great monument. With our borders secure, we shall redouble our effects to defend the Fathers from the faithless and the looters that would despoil them. Luckily, none of them ever found the secret room hidden inside their mighty heads...."

  MJW_resolute_pacifists_desc:0 "Centuries of conflict, both post and pre Great War, have left the land and people scarred beyond measure. War can never be an option to us or our people, nor can it be a reality to our neighbors. Conflict aversion and compromise have gotten us to where we are now and we cannot let a single moment of misjudgement ruin all that humanity has reclaimed from the ashes."

  URA_glowing_crater_ghoul_horde_desc:0 "Although mostly docile, Gabba's weaving of tall tales to protect fleshies from venturing into the Rad-Hazards through fear has done well keeping the peace; unfortunately, they have also had the unintentional effect of greatly damaging the public image of ghouls, leaving social and political relations dire, and causing the sight of just one feral to strike the fear of god into any waster that happens to catch their sight—leaving all cautious of the slumbering hordes lying in Fort Peck."
  URA_horde_grows_restless:0 "The Horde Grows Restless"
  URA_horde_grows_restless_desc:0 "Despite his best efforts, Gabba-Ghoul can't be in all places at once. There's always stray packs separating or ignorant smoothskins thinking they can steal from the unthinking ferals. Every day risks the greater weight of horde traveling outside our safe zone and baring down on nearby settlements. It may be only be a matter of time."

  RRR_postured_elk_desc:0 "The monstrous Fae within the Western Blightlands are beyond reason-- a ravenous group of beasts who have forgotten almost all semblance of sense. Now, they serve as a warning to all who enter the Blightlands, a sign that one has grown too close to the Scarlet Blizzard."
  RRR_cannibal_trappers:0 "Freaks and Weirdos"
  RRR_cannibal_trappers_desc:0 "The horrors of the Blightwood are infamous, and for very good reason. Much of its legacy can be traced back to people who were displaced by the ever-growing Scarlet Blizzard, all of them trying to survive in what was to them a brave new land. Many of them turned to cannibalism and petty banditry in their desperation.. Aside from this, ravenous Frostlurks lurk the mist-laden coves, preying on fishermen and travelers alike."
  RRR_expanding_blizzard:0 "The Growing Woods"
  RRR_expanding_blizzard_desc:0 "Every day, the Blightwoods claim another meter. The Frostlurks grow restless, boldly attacking lone caravans and hunters for feeding new broods. Some say it is only a matter of time until the trees and monsters born of the Scalet Blizzard engulf the entire north...."

  SNO_nomads_new_north_desc:0 "The freezing cold of Saskatchewan has been known by its people for centuries, but in defeating the Mad Trains and their excuse for an army, our nomads have all become something greater. Wandering the snow-covered wastes has strengthened our resolve beyond imagination. We have truly braved the blizzard, and in turn we have learned its utility. From the hazardous storms of the North we have molded a potent weapon against anyone who dares invade our home."

  MTR_expansive_rail_network_desc:0 "The Conductor has done the impossible once more. From a loose conglomerate of familial tribes he has fashioned a focused, homogenous clan. With our newly acquired land our infrastructure has grown incredibly robust, a development which has finally put to rest the hostility between our computerized drivers. Riding high-speed rail across the wastes has truly never felt so good."
