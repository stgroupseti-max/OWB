  MTC_ETIENNE_DESC:0 "§LThe liberation of a nation is something that calls upon all its people. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n§!Being a slum-rat often meant being condemned to slowly wither away. But for Étienne being hidden from the world was exactly what he needed to feel free, his days spent stealing and his nights spent desperately trying to prevent his ill-gotten gains from being retaken. This cycle made him well aware of the inner workings of the Kingdom's Colonization complex but this knowledge didn't lead him to want national freedom. Rather it was the helplessness of his close friend Atione which commanded his recruitment. These boys joined with the slyly titled Boy Scouts to ferry notes and packages across the city and through lockdowns to resistance cells. They showed great aptitude in their missions and so as they grew they rose through the ranks.\n\nEventually the Regina Front for Freedom got the opportunity to connect with the Three Rivers Resistance cells and so they sent Étienne east on an airship to formalize their pact. While he was gone Atoine continued rising until he lead a sizable majority of the cells located in Regina. A shootout with Royal Police would lead to the loss of his arm which Étienne would have replaced with a robotic one fashioned from discontinued novelty robots. With his mission in Three Rivers over, a date set, and weapons delivered, Étienne would return to Regina, and to Atoine, to begin the final stretch of their lives undergound.\nBut the Regina he returned to had changed immensely, with Atoine at the head they no longer ran around in secret. Now they fought pitch battles with the Maréchaussée and caused irreparable damage to the city for which they fought. This Regina, and resistance, Étienne could no longer stomach. So he greeted his dear friend and then quickly said his goodbyes as he looked to keep busy and stay away from a resistance that wanted nothing more than to be in the spotlight. From friends, to colleagues, to rivals, the men slowly drifted apart.§L\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n§GÉtienne would leverage his service into a position as leader of the opposition. Officially called The Constitutionalists, his coalition seeks to move past the long time influence of the army in politics. Hoping to move the Congress into a new age of Métis lead foreign policy.§!"

  MTC_ATOINE_DESC:0 "§LThe liberation of a nation is something that calls upon all its people. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n§!Atoine never dreamed to revel in the mud and slums of Regina. He dreamed to be remembered through the ages, just as the great generals and administrators he read books about did. So when the Métis cried and began to organize, Atoine was there. When a boy was harassed by a police officer, he got a gang and stones and taught them that laws were only what you allowed yourself to be governed by. And when Atoine gained word of a group looking to fight back against their oppressors, he joined, first as a mail carrier along with his best friend. Atoine was eager to show some real resistance, but this movement shied away from retaliating violently or combatively--a code he could not stand for. So he would lead segments in the Boy Scouts into conflict with the police, causing his promotion away from the frontlines. During this time his brother, Étienne, would be called to Three Rivers to connect with merchant resistance fighters. This loosened the lease on Atoine as he no longer had a pacifist voice on his shoulder. Now he flagrantly violated his unofficial demotion and began leading once more the militant members. Atoine began to hear rumors that his fellow resistance leaders have been selling him out to the Police. Leading to a firefight and nuclear explosion of his Fusion Flea, an explosion that would rip his arm from his body. Though his comrades would win the battle and save him, the fight was not over. With a new arm from his absent Brother, Atoine would set about completely ousting the members who wished to find common ground with their oppressors. In this endeavor he was successful, waiting excitedly for his brother to return and see the work he completed. But when Étienne returned it wasn't eagerness that greeted him, but rather a cold jealous child. And so he assigned to Étienne a position that would ensure neither would rub shoulders until the situation could be smoothed over. Without either side seeking resolutions, the distance between the two only grew. From friends, to colleagues, to rivals, the men slowly drifted apart. §L\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n§!§GVictory after victory was achieved during Atoine's march to Manitoba until his campaign was finally stopped in its tracks by Yorkton. Atoine's triumphs would ultimately propel him towards taking leadership over the Congress, although his inability to secure the final victory would haunt him through each of his presidencies. Now, he seeks rearmament and a societal reorganization to prepare for his greatest and last campaign."
