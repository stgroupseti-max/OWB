  mtc_development_funds_from_three_rivers_desc:0 "The western provinces of the Kingdom have never been well developed or utilized, which has left much of our nation stuck in a rut. Luckily, by burning a few bridges out east, we can lobby for some economic aid from our brothers in arms."

  mtc_congress_is_in_session_desc:0 "Congress is in session, and as such battle and foreign diplomacy are giving way to debate and deliberation.

  mtc_choosing_our_national_heroes_desc:0 "Our long and storied past gives us many tales to impart upon younger generations that have never known the struggles the Métis once endured. But who will be our symbol of hope? The persistent Louis Riel or the courageous Gabriel Dumont?"

  mtc_teachings_of_louis_riel_desc:0 "An esteemed politician and diplomat, Louis Riel was a symbol of hope for our people who formed the first National Committee that fought for our rights in the Red River Resistance. Riel tirelessly sought proper treatment of our people, but was ultimately executed following a political circus of a trial. Despute this, we still carry his ideals much farther than any non-indigenous Canadian has carried theirs."
  mtc_poverty_programs:0 "Open our Borders"
  mtc_poverty_programs_desc:0 "For too long have we kept closed our borders to outsiders. If we truly want to carry on the memory of Riel, then we must be more accepting of our neighbours.

  mtc_susbsidized_essentials_desc:0 "The Canada-U.S. border along the 49th Parallel--or as we know it, the Medicine Line--split hundreds of families from their loved ones once it began to be enforced.

  mtc_expansive_defintion_of_metis_desc:0 "Over centuries the true identity of the Métis has been heavily questioned by cynics--both within and without. What does it truly mean to be one of us? Perhaps we should act more tolerant toward all who share our ancestors and legacy?"

  mtc_reconcile_with_anglo_metis_desc:0 "While our people have come into conflict with other tribes in the past, it is wise to put our best foot forward in this desolate wasteland we occupy.

  mtc_restrictive_definiton_of_metis_desc:0 "The wasteland is a harsh place, and the troubles it has brought us have been far from few.

  mtc_metisization:0 "Métis National Council"
  mtc_metisization_desc:0 "Many new-age tribes in our vicinity still remain oppressed and besieged by outside forces like we once were. Instead of letting them simmer out and die like countless before them let's give them our guns and grenades!"
  mtc_foundations_of_civilization:0 "The Foundations of Civilization"
  mtc_foundations_of_civilization_desc:0 "Any civilization, given enough time and power, should be able to sustain itself properly without riding off of hopes that outsiders will help.

  mtc_expand_the_metis_works:0 "Expand the Métis Works"
  mtc_expand_the_metis_works_desc:0 "We have long been craftsmen and traders but now-a-days our resources have started running dry. Let's try to embrace self sustainability by funding the construction of sawmills and trading posts all across the nation."

  mtc_forged_in_fire_desc:0 "The Métis have been beaten down and defeated countless times, the fact our culture still exists is a testament to our strength. We were forged in the fires of history and never intend on having the legacy of being a dimly lit flame, instead we'll go out with a blaze."

  mtc_a_plea_of_sincerity_desc:0 "Moosejaw is a peaceful place, even to a fault. But this peace can only get them so far in the resurgent battlegrounds of Canada. Atoine must make his case to the Everett and his people to join the Congress as an equal. We cannot allow the innocence of their land be ruined by the Electorate or the encroaching Stampede."
  mtc_exploitation_of_the_frontier:0 "Exploitation of the Frontier"
  mtc_exploitation_of_the_frontier_desc:0 "We should begin utilizing the newly reclaimed lands. The real estate of these nations should be used for the increased defence of the Congress. And those not employed for the defence of democracy have no right to relish in its gifts."
  mtc_end_the_assimilation:0 "End the Assimilation"
  mtc_end_the_assimilation_desc:0 "The so-called 'Great' Stampede is nothing more than a overgrown tumor which feasts on the people it conquers to further its conquest. This erasure of culture must be put to an end before there is no one left to liberate."
  mtc_sway_the_farmers:0 "Sway the Southern Farmers"
  mtc_sway_the_farmers_desc:0 "The farmers south of The Katch, once so crucial to the feeding of the Stampede, have been liberated. Only recently being taken into the fold of raiders they are quite ecstatic to the return of normalcy. \nWhat has taken us by surprise however is that these peasant farmers are very politically literate, leading us to wonder where they get the breath of democracy from.

  mtc_source_of_the_red_river_desc:0 "Many of our people occupy land along the Red River, both through generational ownership and also Kingdom attempts to pacify the west through forced migrations to their centers of control.

  mtc_clear_the_riff_raff_desc:0 "Rats of feather squalor together, and now we have many of said rats (sometimes Roaches) along our border and sheltering monarchists, terrorists, and Three Rivers spies.

  mtc_expell_colonists:0 "Crush Dreams of 'Canada'"
  mtc_expell_colonists_desc:0 "There no longer exists any reason for which the colonizing, murdering, and vandalizing nation of Canada would be a stain on our maps.

  mtc_republican_resistance:0 "Resistance from the Constitutionalists"
  mtc_republican_resistance_desc:0 "The once noble opposition has been corrupted by enemies and detractors to nothing more than thinly veiled insurrectionist movement. They pretend to engage in civil debate, and feign interest in cooperation. But all the while, they obstruct military funding with their proceduralism and seek to loosen the grip of generals over their men. They cannot be trusted under any circumstance."
  mtc_lower_the_voting_age:0 "Tie the Voting Age to the Draft Age"
  mtc_lower_the_voting_age_desc:0 "As it stands we have people voting who, in times of great strife, wouldn't be called to defend the Republic. This cannot be allowed to continue, whats worse is the fact that these young voters tend to support a radical and subversive organization."

  mtc_new_high_command_desc:0 "By acknowledging the heroes of our revolt, we not only gain the support of the soldiers but also the recognition that we are competent in our efforts to build our armed forces. Not to mention that there are more chances for more heroes to be made."
  mtc_incorporate_new_technologies:0 "Incorporate New Technologies"
  mtc_incorporate_new_technologies_desc:0 "A strong technological and industrial foundation will set out army apart from the rest of the wasteland. It also just so happens that research done for military purposes tends to produce innovations that improve civilian life just the same."
  mtc_ballistics_expertise:0 "Firearm Innovations"
  mtc_ballistics_expertise_desc:0 "Métis civilians--particularly those in rural areas--are already adept at utilizing conventional rifles for hunting, but most of these weapons are antiquated. If we can develop improved weaponry, people's skills should successfully translate."
  mtc_prioritize_industrial_machinery:0 "Prioritize Industrial Machinery"
  mtc_prioritize_industrial_machinery_desc:0 "An army ill-supplied is an army worth very little. The demand involved in supplying a military in the wasteland go far beyond their munitions, however.

  mtc_a_well_armed_populace_desc:0 "The military brass that once was has gone and left, and the Congress is better-off for it.

  mtc_preservation_of_michif_desc:0 "From the trials of colonization to American occupation, the Michif language endured. But the book burnings that the Kingdom conducted during their own campaign to eradicate it dealt a serious blow, and so went up in flames more of the few remaining records of the language that anchored our national identity. With enough investment, collective knowledge of Michif could be restored, but in an unforgiving wasteland we must assess just how large of a price we're willing to pay."
  mtc_modernize_our_stance:0 "Modernize Our Stance"
  mtc_modernize_our_stance_desc:0 "The extinction of Michif would be a terrible loss, but there are greater concerns facing our people than the widespread use of a language.

  mtc_accept_pidgin_language:0 "Accept Pidgin Language Variants"
  mtc_accept_pidgin_language_desc:0 "Much of the Métis's common use of Michif involves pidgins, or simplified communication that mixes vocabulary from multiple languages. Hardliners have always sought to standardize Michif's use, but the language was itself born out of the mixing of French and Cree languages. In some ways, embracing these differing local dialects simply continues this tradition."
  mtc_appeal_to_youth:0 "Appeal to the Youth"
  mtc_appeal_to_youth_desc:0 "Protecting the culture of the Métis should be a communal effort that future generations carry forward. We can only ensure that if we provide them the opportunity to be properly involved in the process.

  mtc_rights_for_survivors_desc:0 "We tend to wear our open-mindedness on our sleeves. But while our openness to other cultures is quite high, the same is not so true of our treatment of ghouls in the country. Aside from this being a moral failing, it also deprives us of their great wisdom and knowledge--some of which even predates the Great War. Emphasizing this fact will allow us to improve their social standing while providing the opportunity for us to learn all that they know."

  mtc_distinguish_the_culture_desc:0 "The Métis always transcended social and ethnic boundaries, and this is what truly steered the course of our development. Preserving our history is critical, this much is true, but we should derive the correct lessons from it. Our origins lie in the transformation of distinct cultures into one whole. Acceptance of this sort of change over generations is, in fact, true to our identity."
  mtc_federalize_the_revitalization:0 "Federalize the Revitalization"
  mtc_federalize_the_revitalization_desc:0 "The preservation of Michif is not enough; it is paramount to our people's pride that the language not just survive, but be revived to the point of ubiquity in Métis common life.

  mtc_exchange_of_knowledge:0 "Exchange of Knowledge"
  mtc_exchange_of_knowledge_desc:0 "Within the southwest of our borders reside some individuals from the Assiniboine tribe who made their way North following our independence and the worsening conditions in their part of Northern Montana. Descendents of Fort Peck, they possess expertise in fixing old computer technology. Learning these skills would uncover data held in many old machines we possess, including historical records."
  mtc_contract_digital_archivists:0 "Fund Digital Archival Efforts"
  mtc_contract_digital_archivists_desc:0 "Regina has always been home to many other groups since we first assisted in its post-war reconstruction, but the Kingdom made great efforts to prevent cooperation and promote factionalism between us. In a gesture of good faith to rectify this, we could employ many of the Assiniboine people's foremost electronics experts to aid in creating digital archives of all our critical data, safeguarding it for the future."
  mtc_computer_industry:0 "Industrial Electronics"
  mtc_computer_industry_desc:0 "Our work with the Assiniboine has payed dividends to our own understanding of operating computers, network infrastructure and many rudimentary electronic devices which we once lacked the knowledge to properly reverse-engineer. In this way, our cultural revitalization has also provided the foundations for greater scientific and industrial development to the great benefit of future generations."
  mtc_code_talkers:0 "23rd Century Code Talkers"
  mtc_code_talkers_desc:0 "One of the foremost barriers to Michif's widespread adoption has always been practicality. After all, if a suitable niche to separate it from more common languages can't be found, of what use is it to civilian life? With greater technological development and our realization of its utility in tactical settings and counter-intelligence, we've found this niche. Hopefully it will be the first of many."
  mtc_fruits_of_our_labor:0 "Fruits of Our Labor"

  mtc_establish_the_flammand_project:0 "Ratify the Flammand Program"
  mtc_establish_the_flammand_project_desc:0 "With our language revival campaign underway, the Congress has begun deliberating on our lack of formal schooling nationally. Advocates for the restoration of public education have come forth with a proposal for funding its restoration. Dubbed the "Flammand Project" after the family renowned for their advocacy for Michif, its curriculum would position teaching the language as a central tenet in education."
  mtc_reenact_legal_protections:0 "Reenact Legal Protections"
  mtc_reenact_legal_protections_desc:0 "Under the Kingdom, puppets of the Nobles pushed a great amount of laws and rhetoric hostile to the interest of a flourishing Michif. Repealing their legislation was one of the very first actions the Congress ever took, but adults who remember these crackdowns still fear using the language publicly. In order to restore their confidence, we must make it their explicit legal right to do so."
  mtc_pass_reimbursement_program:0 "Launch Reimbursement Projects"
  mtc_pass_reimbursement_program_desc:0 "Regina's fires destroyed many people's livelihoods, and too often a person stripped of their livelihood is a person stripped of their influence in the community. For language revitalization to be achieved, its speakers--a demographic that has struggled greatly to recover economically--must increase their wealth and income. An investment in them could begin the reinvigoration of entire neighbourhoods."
  mtc_redistribute_government_land:0 "Release Former Noble Properties"
  mtc_redistribute_government_land_desc:0 "Swathes of our land were divided as spoils for nobles and royal sycophants under the Kingdom. Since being seized by the government, the majority of these properties have remained untouched--partly out of fear of angering their former owners out east into hawkishness. The Congress of today resents the notion of succumbing to this fear, however, recommending we open them for housing and other purposes. And so the people shall have back what was always rightfully theirs."
  mtc_approve_morin_act:0 "Pass the Morin Act"
  mtc_approve_morin_act_desc:0 "Opponents of our language program claim our government's focus on intellectual pursuits makes it out of touch with the reality of people's lives. They undervalue our project's material benefits, but their point bears some truth. Named after Métis National Council President Gerald Morin, the Morin Act will follow his value of self-governance by providing jobs that practically apply Michif to new industries."
  mtc_nationalized_education:0 "Nationalize Schooling"
  mtc_nationalized_education_desc:0 "In one of our earliest acts of resistance at the onset of the American Occupation, many Métis communities attempted to subvert or undermine the newly propagandized education system in favor of homeschooling. This was invaluable for ensuring education survived the bombs through family tradition, but it also fostered a broader opposition to public schooling--a trend which our new government must now swiftly reverse."
  mtc_linguistic_revival:0 "Linguistic Revival"
  mtc_linguistic_revival_desc:0 "Michif is the heart of what it means to be Métis. Our campaign to protect it came with some cost, but it's been well worth it to strengthen our people's sense of identity. Now in cities and small settlements alike the language pervades common speech just as much as English does, and a renaissance of historical traditions now begins to follow suit."

  mtc_establish_assiniboine_ports_desc:0 "The rivers of Canada were of great importance to our ancestors, particularly for being the lifeline through which people and goods came and went. With our rebellion from the kingdom, though, access to the Assiniboine from the western shore is greatly limited. It would be smart to rectify this."
  mtc_develop_the_river_docks:0 "Develop the River Docks"
  mtc_develop_the_river_docks_desc:0 "The development that's begun on the riverbank has provided strong foundations for establishing a larger harbor there. This has allowed us to begin repairing several wrecked passenger boats and trading ships that we've left idle on the shore for some time now, as well as improve Moosomin's manufacturing base wholesale."
  mtc_boon_of_river:0 "The River's Boon"
  mtc_boon_of_river_desc:0 "As the harbor grows, so too do its facets. The natural resources of the shoreline were always sufficient, but as trade goes underway additional materials are supplied, and our capacity to use the river as a bountiful source of energy and drinking water improves. It has improved so much so, in fact, that the rural areas have become home to a breadth of new settlements."
  mtc_promote_ship_manufacturing:0 "Promote Ship Manufacturing"
  mtc_promote_ship_manufacturing_desc:0 "We have always been known as excellent shipwrights, but this industry has not thrived extensively since our independence from the monarchy was secured. Pursuing greater development for the industry would be quite beneficial."

  mtc_birchbark_canoes_desc:0 "Our craftsmen have long struggled to fashion canoes up to their standards due to the scarcity of birch trees locally. Importing it via the Assiniboine is impractical given our... tumultuous past with the monarchy. Fortunately, traders recently arrived in Regina's southern tributaries with piles of lumber and reports of vacant forests in the north. With this new supply, the shortage can finally be resolved."
  mtc_highway_refurbish:0 "Renovating Highway 18"
  mtc_highway_refurbish_desc:0 "The Great War came and went long ago, and yet most of Canada's roads and infrastructure are still left in disrepair. If we want to be able to transport people and materials across our land quickly, we will first need to restore the highway that cuts through the south."
  mtc_potash_mines:0 "Opening the Potash Mines"
  mtc_potash_mines_desc:0 "Colder temperatures make the land south of the Qu'Appelle not as ideal for farming as it once was, but the area is fertile enough that it wouldn't be unreasonably difficult to make up for that fact. Luckily enough, the area also was home to many mines that harvested materials used in fertilizer. Restoring them would not only improve our agriculture but also provide employment opportunities."
  mtc_local_processing:0 "Local Processing"
  mtc_local_processing_desc:0 "Since our inception, our people have prided themselves on their self-reliance, something which the resolution of our agricultural issues is a testament to. Investing in local facilities for processing materials from the mines into fertilizer will only accentuate this fact by promoting industrial development."
  mtc_strong_domestic_markets:0 "Strong Domestic Markets"
  mtc_strong_domestic_markets_desc:0 "With our people being the producers of the same goods that are then reinvested into their communities, wealth disparity has continued to decline as basic amenities become more widely available. This creates a reliable cycle of production and consumption that opens the door to greater profits from extensive trading with those outside our borders."
  mtc_potash_exports:0 "Northern Saskatchewan Exports"
  mtc_potash_exports_desc:0 "It's time we take advantage of foreign markets for our goods. The [IRC.GetName] have been allies of ours ever since our cooperation in the Fur Trade and the North-West Rebellion led by Louis Riel, a favor which we returned during their civil disobedience towards American occupation. Potash already is commonly bartered for by local arms merchants, so why shouldn't we emulate this exchange elsewhere?"
  mtc_revitalize_weyburn:0 "Revitalize Weyburn"
  mtc_revitalize_weyburn_desc:0 "Though not our capital, Weyburn was once a substantial city in Saskatchewan in its own right. Considering the quantity of arms and other supplies that the Fur Trade will need to blossom, restoring the place would provide a suitable secondary location for hunters and trappers to congregate and conduct their business out of."
  mtc_balanced_beaver_breakfast:0 "A Beaver's Balanced Breakfast"
  mtc_balanced_beaver_breakfast_desc:0 "Initially, beaver ranges in Canada avoided most exposure to nuclear fallout. When dropping temperatures forced much of the species further south, however, many of the animals grew irradiated, one consequence of which was a loss in fur density that lowered yields for trappers. By introducing more nutritious crops and vegatation into their ranges, though, we could reverse this decline."
  mtc_industrial_heart:0 "Industrial Heart"
  mtc_industrial_heart_desc:0 "As the trade is reinvigorated, so too is Regina. The city's first recovery following the Great War took long enough that after the Kingdom scorched blocks of civilian neighbourhoods we knew it would take time before we could repair the damage. With the economy finally rising undeterred by any foreign oppressor, that time seems to be now."
  mtc_settling_grudges:0 "Formally Reconcile With the Lakota"
  mtc_settling_grudges_desc:0 "It is by our hands that we may grant the same peace to the Sioux that our ancestors once did in aid of them.

  mtc_hunter_militias:0 "Hunter Militias"
  mtc_hunter_militias_desc:0 "In times of war, when the will of our nation is tested, the expertise our hunters possess could also be turned toward defending people's homes and communities.

  mtc_seasoned_expeditionaries_desc:0 "When men and women of the trade return from the wilderness, it is with more than animal coats and pelts in tow. For there was a time when great swathes of Manitoba and Saskatchewan were known to us in detail. The Great War changed the landscape dramatically, though, and the kingdom's fall from grace has done so once more. But as hunters bring stories of their encounters home, our readiness to face the unknown only grows."

  mtc_call_upon_veterans:0 "Call Upon Veterans of the Revolution"
  mtc_call_upon_veterans_desc:0 "Our revolt was pieced together by those sick of Manitoban rule, unorganized in its essence, those who fought did so with a fierce passion for freedom from the crown in their heart.

By incorporating this, we also encourage them to build support between one another."
  mtc_aviation_development:0 "Regina Aviation Development"
  mtc_aviation_development_desc:0 "Investigating the old airfield near Regina revealed the presence of antique biplanes with engines in semi-working condition. The warehouses within which they resided were guarded by garrisons from the kingdom with the contents kept secret, no doubt with the eventual hope of accumulating the necessary resources to transport them east. Now that we have access, we can instead further our own research."

  mtc_airfield_restoration_desc:0 "Southeastern Saskatchewan was home to many airstrips in its heyday.

Doing so will also allow us to refurbish some of the more rudimentary aircraft held nearby in the process."
  mtc_prairie_bomber_practice:0 "Study Drop Weapon Trajectories"
  mtc_prairie_bomber_practice_desc:0 "Such open, flat land provides an excellent location for training novice pilots in the use of heavy ordnance from the air. Effectively utilizing this would open up the use of light bombers to support men and women on the ground or heavier ones to batter enemy fortifications. In either case, it would make better use of the clear airspace our newly repaired fighters provide."

  mtc_study_engine_blueprints_desc:0 "Studying these old blueprints, or better yet giving our engineering team blueprints to study at all, is bound to better their understanding of the old world's aerial constructions, and lead us to developing our own, perhaps even better than what they made then."
