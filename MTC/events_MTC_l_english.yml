  nf_mtc.1.t:0 "Our Revolution"
  nf_mtc.1.d:0 "Before even the invasion of Canada, the people who lived in and around the Katch have yearned for independence. But even after nuclear devastation ravaged the world, not much changed for the Canadian Great Plains, as they were still ruled by an Angloid from the east. Soon the Métis would find an opportunity to once again spill blood for their people's dream. \n\nThis opportunity would come in the form of merchant unrest in the eastern frontier of the Kingdom. And as weapons began flowing to the Revolutionary Councils in Regina from benefactors to the North and East, it became clear exactly where the soon-to-be republic would fall in the coming struggles. With the rise of nationalist activity, so too rose police activity from the Kingdom's loyal hound dogs. Arrests for swamp clearing and penal labor became rampant and martial law became the norm for those in the urban centers.\n\nWhen the Royal Military Police departed north to begin frontier penal reclamation, Atoine was informed of the Merchants' rise in the east, so he ordered his cells to strike and by the end of the day the Military Police were stranded north of the Katch and militias had seized control of the western reaches of the Métis' land.\n\nIn the coming days it would be decided whether a true democracy for the Métis would have to wait until the nascent revolution was solidified. This disagreement led to the formation of two impromptu parties; §CThe Constitutionalists§!, who believed an immediate democracy was the only way to prevent the rise of a populist dictator, and §0The Confederalists§!, headed by the army who argued that speedbumps during the beginning moments of their independence would lead to the loss of said independence."

  nf_mtc.2.t:0 "The Building of a Nation"
  nf_mtc.2.d:0 "As our boys on the field fought against the Kingdom's lapdogs, the people of Regina hashed out what centuries of effort would culminate into. Whether our Republic would have a strong central head or if power should be decentralized to the senate of peoples. \n\n§0The Confederalists§! argued that with the recent success of the military, a single powerful president with a cabinet of officers from the High Command would serve the Republic in both war and peace. \n\n§CThe Constitutionalists§! however, pointed to those same victories as to why the military is perfectly fine without even more power inside the government.\n\n\n\nThese debates would rage for weeks as both party leaders, Atoine and Étienne, are off fighting Yorkton for control of The Katch or arguing with Three Rivers Merchant leaders for more weapons and aid, respectively."

  nf_mtc.3.d:0 "Étienne has recently returned from Transcona with good and bad news. His attempts to secure funding from Three Rivers have proven successful, they have approved funding to stabilize our industrial base, but Étienne isn't the most subtle of diplomats and has sullied our reputation within their Republic. \n\nThese approved factories would be a monumental boost to our people's standard of living, making our fight for survival more legitimate in the eyes of many of the most hardline nay-sayers. Sadly, Atoine has returned as well, with even worse news. His attempts to cross The Katch have proven disastrous, with much of his army being wiped out by Yorkton. This loss has allowed the Military Police and Yorkton to regroup and they've begun marching on Regina. Atoine claims that he must commandeer the funds to rebuild the army and save the Republic. And while his loss is undeniable, whether the threat is as great as he claims is entirely unknown, after all, this could all be an attempt to ruin Étienne's public image and placate a war hawk high command."

And although the military has lead the country since the revolution, it hasn't been through a junta. Our people decided that it was a sacrifice that needed to be made, and now with the crises seeming to come to an end the people must decide once more whether the mandate of rule is a gift to give to the army.

  nf_mtc.6.t:0 "An Extended Hand"
  nf_mtc.6.d:0 "The Métis Congress have extended an 'offer' of protection against any outside incursions, namely from the Bloody Electorals. This is very clearly an ultimatum to give away our independence and does our disarmed and small nation have any other option but to accept?"

When your soldiers march, it won't be against an armed foe, but rather a land that poses no danger. When they return home to hopeful eyes they won't have a valiant war story of courage, but one of silent parades down streets of unamused onlookers and they will face the reality of what they destroyed.\n\n May you and your people be damned." \n\n-Everett"

  nf_mtc.8.t:0 "Back on Track"
  nf_mtc.8.d:0 "The Engine Families huddle in the Wheelhouse, mulling over the letter from Étienne. Its wording clearly indicating the severity of denial. Round and round they went, arguing over each word and whether to believe it. \nWas he serious? Is this truly him extending an olive branch attempting to stave off a Congressional dog hunt? Surely they didn't think the Madtrains were literally... Mad. Hours of debate with no meaningful progress passed when the Conductor finally spoke..."

  nf_mtc.10.d:0 "The brothers and sisters of our congregation must never forget our troubled past, the past where we denied peace to the people of the world and the past that blocks us from a place amongst the lord in heaven. We have been given a chance to rectify one of our innumerous sins, the sin of ignoring the Métis calls during their war for freedom. For when they called to our congregation for help, we were blind to the truth of the wasteland, we saw death as the way of the lord so we turned a blind eye to their oppression but now they ask that we join them in ending oppression further north. So I leave the decision up to the people occupying the building of the lord today."

  nf_mtc.12.d:0 "The Métis and Three Rivers Republic have renewed their coalition, something that is in affect, an Anti-Kingdom Pact. They wish for us to join this Second Coalition for mutual protection, but if we do it will likely lead to a violation of our long standing neutrality."

  nf_mtc.14.d:0 "Following the recent breakdown in relations between the Métis Congress and Three Rivers Republic, the Métis Congress has decided to explore foreign relations independent of that of their former ally. Whether this announced change in course will lead to more peace or an increase in bloodshed for the Far North, has yet to be seen. But one thing is for certain, a regional power such as The Congress will surely shake up the political scene of Canada."

  nf_mtc.18.d:0 "Étienne was finally sat in the presidential palace, though to him it seemed much more like a bunker, and now he can set about moving past a shared history of conflict. He's decidedly going to start by planting some ferns and hiring an interior decorator. It's clear no one in the CNL is a creative as their use of gray and black doesn't mess well with the natural beauty of the city.\n\nFor years the nation has been stuck in stagnation waiting for Atoine to finally end his mad crusade against his own defeats and with Atoine ousted we can finally see progress return to our city. While Étienne looks to the future hopeful, he is no fool and he knows that planting will not prevent conflict from looking to ravage their land. So while he distances himself from the self-defeating near worsip of the Atoine administration he still prepares to defend the Republic against its historic enemy. \n\nAs light returns to the Capital, Atoine and his closest advisors sulk in the Congressional Halls and Buearocratic debate rooms. It's no secret to many within the Government that the recent election tension has been hightened by an age old rivalry that couldn't be mended by a revolution. Atoine can do nothing but stare in hardly hidden contempt as Étienne removes golden sceptres and military paintings from the palace for a home in a museum. Étienne can't help but notice the stoic old man and quickly intercepts him before he can return to his cabnit. He presents Atoine twin journals, bound in leather, carved with the Métis infinity symbol, and clearly worn with age."

  nf_mtc.19.t:0 "The Strength of Our Heritage"
  nf_mtc.19.d:0 "Our people's mixed ancestry originated in the 17th century when French merchants seeking to strengthen the Fur Trade came into contact with various indigenous tribes. Although the European colonization of Canada was not free from strife for many Indigenous people, these trappers and tribes developed mutual respect as they built a robust network of settlements and trading posts across the continent. \n\nThis was concurrent with unions made between French settler men and Indigenous women. These common-law marriages were known as "Marriage à la façon du pays", or "according to the custom of the country", due to their mix of European and Indigenous tradition, and they formed the firm backbone of the entire Fur Trade. Although trading companies first opposed this, Indigenous peoples and European settlers both encouraged it, as the economic ties created by these intermarriages led to a stable, prosperous exchange. The two formed a deep symbiotic relationship; as the men orchestrated the trade and bartered for European goods, Indigenous women led their boats down the rivers, taught them to use the land's resources, prepared swathes of essential tools, cured food for expeditions and helped manufacture their canoes. It was these unions, spurred on by pragmatism and strong social bonds, that brought with them the ethnogenesis of the Métis. And though the landscape of North America changed over centuries, our vital role in the trade continued, and our efforts to bridge cultural gaps persisted even as conflict arose. \n\nWe come from a lineage of skilled hunters and trappers, but also of negotiators--both traders and diplomats. These traits that form the backbone of our culture have guided us in weathering many storms, from hostile governments of the past to the anarchic wasteland of the present. But with neighbors east and west that threaten to destabilize Canada once more, we must rely on them further to secure the safety and well-being of not just our people but of all free people in the North."
  nf_mtc.19.a:0 "Indeed."
  nf_mtc.20.t:0 "Traders From the Métis"
  nf_mtc.20.d:0 "It seems that merchants from the group of Métis down in southern Saskatchewan have arrived on the riverbank seeking to re-establish trade relations with us. The traders offer us fertilizer sourced from potash mines in their land, which they assert will be strong enough to help plants finally survive the winter months if applied during the warmer springs and summers. In exchange, they'd like to barter for some of our older firearms to aid their newly freed people's defence. The Iron Confederacy once aided the Métis in their struggles for independence centuries ago, and in their gratitude they remained a loyal ally ever since. Surely we could spare the resources to help them in their time of need once more?"
  nf_mtc.20.a:0 "They can always depend on us."
  nf_mtc.20.b:0 "Politely refuse and send them on their way."

  nf_mtc.21.d:0 "As luck would have it, our old Cree allies have not forgotten their past with us and have accepted our deal. We can only hope the materials we've offered them will prove as valuable as the equipment and knowledge they've provided to us."
  nf_mtc.21.a:0 "Dependable as ever."
  nf_mtc.22.t:0 "[IRC.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
  nf_mtc.22.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Cree to the north have rejected our trade offer, claiming to be unable to give up any of their arms in their present situation. Given the conflict the threats they face, this is a disappointing but ultimately understandable response. Hopefully this does not bode poorly for our diplomatic relations long-term."
  nf_mtc.22.a:0 "Best of luck to them."
  nf_mtc.23.t:0 "An Endangered Language"
  nf_mtc.23.d:0 "Perhaps the characteristic most emblematic of the Métis is our language. Michif includes multiple distinct dialects, all of which entail a combination of Cree and French which parallels our mixed nationality. \n\nOver the 19th and 20th centuries that Michif faced serious decline due to settler colonialism in Canada, with speakers in amounts as low as triple digits. Surprisingly, this course was averted in part due to the otherwise detrimental American occupation of Canada. Faced with harsh rule and the constant threat of informants, Métis resistance fighters adopted Michif--particularly forms that borrowed more heavily from Cree than French--as a means of secure communication. The effectiveness of this strategy coupled with greater isolation due to strict rules on travel led to Michif literacy skyrocketing before the Great War, and enduring thereafter. \n\nThat is, until the Kingdom of Manitoba--with the benefit of hindsight on American occupation's failures--saw fit to eradicate Michif. Manitoba strictly enforced the outlawing of languages the Crown did not officially recognize. Over decades of this policy, literacy rates dropped dangerously low once again. This reached a boiling point when at the onset of our rebellion Manitoba set aflame Regina's libraries and the records within. \n\nThis barbaric act made our victory a much less joyful one, and diminshed our people's appetitie for further conflict. But with Manitoba on the brink once again, it seems we have little choice in the matter. The community and government leaders must decide on a course forward to protect Michif and our culture broadly. Reformists argue that historical preservation for future efforts is the most pragmatic approach given the attention foreign threats demand. Meanwhile, others assert that a costly endeavor which fully restores Michif's prominence and instills strong national identity in the population would create a much stronger people."

  nf_mtc.24.d:0 "The history of the Métis and the Sioux is one of a tumultuous relationship, marked with cycles of battles and treaties. So caught up fighting over territory we were that neither side could narrow their focus on the colonising forces that had left us fighting over a fraction of the land we once held. But following the last of these battles, when the Battle of Little Big Horn forced the hand of the American government, Sitting Bull led his band into Canada rather than surrendering. And as the buffalo disappeared, and the band grew desperate, it was a French-Canadian trader--one alligned with and supplied by the Métis--who gave all he had to feed the starving Sioux. \n\nWhere few in the wasteland feel connection to the nationality of their ancestors, and fewer still care to carry on century-old allegiences, the people of Standing Rock are not keen on following suit. They have far from forgotten their history, and it is one that would light a fire in a man that no other tribe's tale could match. Between their history with us and their history with the Americans, it is unsurprising that a great sense of distrust pervades their approach to diplomacy. Promises and platitudes will fall on deaf ears with nothing to back them up. But there is proof in our actions, in the final gesture of the trader Jean-Louis Légaré and our support and enabling of him. The Kit Fox at their head remember the wrongs their people were dealt. Reminding them of Légaré, even as the warrior societies grow increasingly militant in their ambitions, may just allow us to find an alliance where our ancestors failed to in centuries past."
  nf_mtc.24.a:0 "We must try."
  nf_mtc.25.t:0 "The Métis' Petition"
  nf_mtc.25.d:0 "A group of diplomats from [MTC.GetNameDef] arrived by boat today, requesting to speak to our chief. Upon granting them their request, [STR.GetLeader] was surprised to hear their offer of greater economic and military cooperation between their people and ours. Historically, the relationship between the Métis and Sioux was... volatile to say the least. For the Kit Fox's part, though, she had little care for them one way or the other. After all, neither side kept to every treaty between them. And look where their approach landed them--decades spent shackled by Manitoba's impotent excuse for a ruler. We could put a gun to the King's head and the Métis would still have us "negotiate". \n\nBut what the Kit Fox did not expect was to hear of how the Métis fought off this King, of how they brought the Kingdom to a fraction of its former size and had his men on the run north. The diplomats told her of this show of strength, and reminded her of the aid the Métis ultimately lent the great chief Sitting Bull when his band was on the brink of starvation. The Métis were here not only to earn our favor, but to forge economic and military bonds that would strengthen us both. Choosing this path would not be easy given our rocky past, but though [STR.GetLeader] remained skeptical, the Métis had made an unexpectedly strong case."
  nf_mtc.25.a:0 "This is a fruitless endeavor."

  nf_mtc.26.t:0 "[STR.GetName] Accepts"
  nf_mtc.26.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned with news that Shappa Wagner of [STR.GetName] has accepted our offer of further cooperation between our peoples. The Sioux are far from ready to enter in open military alliance, and they put forward conditions for this process to start small. The primary terms, aside from the exchange of certain technology, are for the reenactment of a treaty between our nations and a mutual pledge to provide military aid when most necessary."
  nf_mtc.26.a:0 "Excellent"
  nf_mtc.27.t:0 "[STR.GetName] Declines "
  nf_mtc.27.d:0 "Unfortunately, Shappa Wagner of [STR.GetName] was wholly unreceptive to our appeal for cooperation. As it turns out, it seems that our offer was of very little interest to them one way or the other. Although our diplomats were allowed to pass through without incident, and they express no open hostility towards us, this seems to suggest that the Kit Fox may hold ambitions for Manitoba."
  nf_mtc.27.a:0 "We should prepare for this possibility."
