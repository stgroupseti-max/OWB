  tpa_fenrir_desc:0 "§RThis one's a bit more of a dejected facility, really, the one that slipped by the records and was left by the wayside.

  ### Focus Left - Mild Industry stuff. This includes and will include a silly event where you have to pick a side between a fight of American ### ghouls and Chinese ghouls who are at war. This could be a silly place to put some of her bullshit propaganda, maybe?

  tpa_sided_with_americans_desc:0 "§RAmerica's old news, I ain't forgettin' that. MANIFEST is always what came first outside of how pretty money could be. Now, when you told me there were livin', breathin' Americans under my nose, I giggled a little bit. What was I gonna do to them that they didn't already do to themselves? Well, instead of killin' 'em, why don't we throw a few of our cards out their way? See what that gets us long-term.§!"

  tpa_sided_with_communists:0 "Lost Dragoons"
  tpa_sided_with_communists_desc:0 "§RLook at that! Genuine Chinese Dragoons who've been stuck out in the Scarlet Blizzard since before the war.

Maybe we can squeeze this our way.§!"

  tpa_secured_air_base:0 "Moose Lake Air Base"
  tpa_secured_air_base_desc:0 "§RIt seems the USA forces within the area had a secret landing area they had been making use of for their operations since before the war. That's cute. Whatever the case may be, it is now open to us. Why don't we make use of it?§!"

  tpa_fairy_genome_desc:0 "§RSo those folks out there are calling them "Fairies," you say? Well, I can't say that's the word I'd have used, but hell, if we can use their DNA, I ain't about to look a gift horse in the mouth. These friends of yours seemed pretty agile; I'm willin' to bet we can make you dance just like they did, with enough kick to boot.§!"
  tpa_ghoul_sequencing:0 "Ghoul Sequencing"
  tpa_ghoul_sequencing_desc:0 "§RWhen nuclear hellfire came over the world, I figured it was over and out for little old me. Thought things would get real lonely, you see? But turns out it didn't. Half the staff that was left had burns so bad they ended up healing right back up. Sure, I may have tinkered with them a little bit, but there ain't nothing I've seen that says we can't put that regeneration on your average Dave or Buster, sport.§!"

See now, I bet you I can isolate the ideal parts of their scheme and shove 'em into your soup. Imagine this: "A world where bein' big don't mean a thing." Rolls off the tongue like taffy, don't it?§!"
  tpa_elemental_infusion:0 "Elemental Infusion"
  tpa_elemental_infusion_desc:0 "§RThere ain't a man or woman alive who don't turn their heads when they see a paying MANIFEST customer flick their fingers and light a cigarette just like that. Now imagine the sorta things we could do if we went even deeper into it. Making ice cubes with a snap, shootin' lightning from your eyes... We live in an age of dreams, sport. And we ain't ever lookin' to wake up.§!"
  tpa_parahuman:0 "Parahumanity"
  tpa_parahuman_desc:0 "§RSee, with these sorts of dilemmas, you run into the issue of parahumanity. Folks too far gone, if you can believe it, sport. Now, thankfully, we live in a world where there isn't any corporate nancies to tell us how we ought to think about things, and the way I see it, we ain't those kinds of folks. Normally we have folks on a limited trial; smoke a Lucifer, drink a Tonic, and get all the power you want for a good hour or two. 'Course, you and me, champ? We're here to stay in business for good. You get the whole package.§!"

  tpa_postmodern_horrors_desc:0 "§RWe've seen plenty of them out in the Blightwood, but these 'faeries' sure are something, huh? What really gets me is WE didn't make 'em. I should know; I've seen the files.§!"

  tpa_agriculture_research:0 "The Wonders We Left Behind"
  tpa_agriculture_research_desc:0 "§RMANIFEST Saskatchewan and all its adorable little satellite sites have so much left for us to plunder. Red Fern research is just the tip of the iceberg.§!"

  tpa_pleasantdale_population:0 "The Plump Nobility"
  tpa_pleasantdale_population_desc:0 "§RWoo-wee! Look at that. These nobles in Pleasantdale sure are chunky for a bunch of wastelanders and vagabonds, huh? I always wanted to see how much you could pump into someone like that before they burst. Is there a maximum capacity, I wonder? We'll just have to see... And maybe, we'll get some we can keep around.§!"

  tpa_mutated_things:0 "Starting Small"
  tpa_mutated_things_desc:0 "§RSome folks say I don't know anything about restraint! The nerve of em. Once I'm done with the first round of testing, they can serve in the second.§!"

  tpa_fairy_tech:0 "Their Own Little Monsters"
  tpa_fairy_tech_desc:0 "§RNow, look at that, sport-- the Faeries came from here. Little HOPE was responsible for it. Should have known she'd want to make some toys of her own! Ain't it a helluva thing?§!"

  tpa_fairy_tech_upgrade:0 "Monsters, Imp."
  tpa_fairy_tech_upgrade_desc:0 "§RNow that these Sisters are back together, I have a few ideas how we can improve her products. After all, two heads are better than one. Hmm, two headed fairies..... nah, they don't need to be thinking too much.§!"

  tpa_clearing_snow_desc:0 "§RI know the Blizzard ain't the best thing for ya'll to be walking around in, but it keeps us away from most morons and lets me think easy. That being said, everybody's gotta do some house cleaning every now and then...§!"

  tpa_encourage_work_desc:0 "§RI know the value of a good bit of diplomacy, son, and I doubt these people are gonna be real polite to us if we just throw 'em into the fire. That's not to say that's not what I WANT to happen, but sometimes you gotta compromise in life.§!"

  tpa_smiling_jacks_hollow:0 "Smiling Jack's Hollow"
  tpa_smiling_jacks_hollow_desc:0 "§RSee, this 'Smiling Jack' character was one heck of a guy-- a real fighter, he was, 'til I cooked his brain and stretched him like taffy. Now he's a gibbering mess of a monster, and he's in the way. Kill him.§!"

  nf_tpa.1.t:0 "The Ghost of MANIFEST North"
  nf_tpa.1.d:0 "Everybody's heard the name, everybody's seen the old posters with her face on them, but nobody knows the story. \n\nDestiny is an AI programmed originally by Sydney Loke as an iteration then known as 'Jormungandr,' a designated 'welfare attendant' akin to Hope in Pleasantdale. However, after the American Annexation of Canada, she and her sister were retrofitted from their more norse-themed shells into the a gross hybrid of the Americana of yesterday and Canadian imagery. \n\nWhile Hope was allowed to retain a great amount of her original code, Destiny was almost entirely rewritten by other scientists after Dr. Loke's unfortunate demise. Designed to both maintain MANIFEST North and discover new uses for chemicals and such found within itself, Destiny was left with a great amount of..."
  nf_tpa.1.a:0 "Production lines that persist even now."
  nf_tpa.1.b:0 "Machines by which to do her bidding."
  nf_tpa.1.c:0 "Guns intended for high-stakes security."

  nf_tpa.2.t:0 "The Scarlet Blizzard"
  nf_tpa.2.d:0 "While the workers of MANIFEST fell into Destiny's traps or left to be consumed by the nuclear winter, Destiny continued toiling away within. Though she was limited in her capacity, she still strived to do her duty as best as she could, regurgitating horror after horror, aberattion after aberattion into the wasting blizzards outside her door. \n\nFrom the vast amount of energy needed to run MANIFEST North, flaming ash flies off into the blizzard, leaving the air as a blood-red sunset, a foreboding warning to any who dare to approach her realm too closely. If the Scarlet Blizzard doesn't skin your flesh alive, then the Umbravores and other horrible monsters from her labs would."
  nf_tpa.2.a:0 "Her facility was protected."
  nf_tpa.2.b:0 "Such a terrible fate..."

  nf_tpa.3.t:0 "Along Came Some Inmates..."
  nf_tpa.3.d:0 "Most who came through the blizzard did so and were thrown out as quickly as she found them and conducted whatever terrible experiment on them she could. It was only when three particular inmates came into her demesne that she had a realization click into place-- these three were all so very different, yet all wanted nothing more than her mercy. She could bind them to herself by altering them, giving them psychic powers she had found through genetic manipulation, and forcing them to be dependent on her alone. Raiders, she realized, were the only sort of brash cowards who would reliably make such deals... And so she began screening those who came too close to her facility. They could be anything she wanted them to be, and they'd hop at the opportunity to be it."
  nf_tpa.3.a:0 "She kept an open eye..."
  nf_tpa.3.b:0 "...But really, quality mattered."

  nf_tpa.4.t:0 "Runoff"
  nf_tpa.4.d:0 "§RNow you and I both know quite a bit about collateral damage. It's how we got into this little situation of ours, ain't it? Well, you mighta heard of this thing called the "Blightwood" outside the big ol' blizzard we've been blasting out of this facility for the better half of two centuries. See, I didn't really mean for it to come about, but it seems it's become a bit of a nest for all sorts of unsavory types. \n\nNow, if I had to guess about what sort of folks are calling the shots around there, I'd figure two things: it's either freaks or creeps, and, well, we can't have those runnin' around, can we? Let's get to work.§!"
  nf_tpa.4.a:0 "When do we get deputy pay?"

  nf_tpa.5.t:0 "A Town Away From Trouble"
  nf_tpa.5.d:0 "§ROutlaws tend to make due with what they got. They're survivors, and they have to be pretty good at it to make it far in this world. Especially when there's enough cries of civilization as of late to make any old criminal wipe some sweat off their noggin. Turns out I've had a few under my own nose for quite a few years, now-- and I've already sent them a welcoming gift. The blizzard'll cover your entry, but they know you're on the way. Whaddya think about breakin' into a town full of reprobates and scumbags?§!"
  nf_tpa.5.a:0 "Let's not pretend you have a choice."

  nf_tpa.6.t:0 "Securing What We Can"
  nf_tpa.6.d:0 "§RSee, sport, we can only expend so much in these hard times. I reckon that if we're gonna set up any kind of proper operation in this here dam we're gonna need a side we can really dedicate ourselves to. Northern's got more power, but southern's got some metal we can make use of. Choice is yours, kid. Either way I'm gettin' what I need out of it.§!"
  nf_tpa.6.a:0 "We will secure the Northern Dam Array."
  nf_tpa.6.b:0 "We will secure the Southern Dam Array."

  nf_tpa.7.t:0 "Junkyard Rodeo"
  nf_tpa.7.d:0 "§RWe-hell, look at that. Looks like we got ourselves some genu-ine new arrivals! Seems they've taken a fancy for the old company junk lot, the very same with a bunch of old prototypes and defunct custodians. Now, I confess that I ain't much of a businesswoman, but I got enough of a brain and sense of property to say they REALLY ought to consider where they get their real estate. \n\nWhy don't you go and show them how we do it in the Scarlet Blizzard?§!"
  nf_tpa.7.a:0 "I love a good lawbringin'!"
  nf_tpa.7.b:0 "Now hold on, I got an idea..."
  nf_tpa.7.c:0 "Gentlemen, welcome to the Pass."

  nf_tpa.8.t:0 "It's Maybelline, Alright"
  nf_tpa.8.d:0 "§RLookin' at what you've got on the table, it's startin' to really seem like this "Mayor Maybelline" ain't such a sweetheart. Take care of her, wouldja? Don't matter a lick to me which one of you gets the shot, just get it done.§!"
  nf_tpa.8.a:0 "She can go down real nice and easy."
  nf_tpa.8.b:0 "I love a good duel!"
  nf_tpa.8.c:0 "Maybe she's a talkin' type."

  nf_tpa.9.t:0 "Define 'Umbravore'"
  nf_tpa.9.d:0 "The 'Umbravore,' as Destiny and her victims know them as, is a monster made largely of mutated discarded flesh. There are various renditions of them, often varying depending on what exactly MANIFEST North is up to at any particular time, but they are in essence the vestigial remnants of things that used to be alive. Somehow, they have learned over time to formulate a hierarchical system, and even make efforts to integrate newly created Umbravores into such a system. \n\nNaturally, that makes them garbage, and garbage's fate is to be destroyed."
  nf_tpa.9.a:0 "I hate this place."

  nf_tpa.10.t:0 "Relics"
  nf_tpa.10.d:0 "§RNow look at this, sport... We got a couple of play-pals out here on the airstrip. Suppose I never poked around as much as I should've, but it seems we got some good old fashioned commie sympathizers locked in conflict with some old 'real American' types. What say we don't maybe pick a side here and see what happens? For fun, if not for science.§!"
  nf_tpa.10.a:0 "The Americans."
  nf_tpa.10.b:0 "The Chinese."

  nf_tpa.11.t:0 "The Werewolf of MANIFEST North"
  nf_tpa.11.d:0 "§ROne of my favorite little projects is still running around, sport-- he loves tearing stuff apart, really, but he's never been good at going for what mattered so I didn't care much to hurt him. Issue is now he's causing me a headache son, and, well, maybe it's time to just dissect him and see what his DNA looks like after a couple years stuck in the blizzard. He can't talk anymore and he's most spending his days flailing around and crying. Hell, he might just be stuck in our fencing perimeter-- so if you wanna just let him on out, sport, I don't reckon anybody's gonna mind.§!"
  nf_tpa.11.a:0 "Better to mercy kill."
  nf_tpa.11.b:0 "Milo can free him!"

  nf_tpa.12.t:0 "Destiny's Hope"
  nf_tpa.12.d:0 "§BHiiiiiii Destiny! It's so good to see you again, you know, even if you want to kill everyone I swore to protect. It's just nice to be a family again!§!"
  nf_tpa.12.a:0 "That's nice to hear, anyway..."

  nf_tpa.13.t:0 "They Called Him Fenrir"
  nf_tpa.13.d:0 "§RThere used to be three of us, sport. Hel, Jormungandr, Fenrir-- they turned Hel into Hope, me into Destiny, and then... Well, Fenrir got trashed. For the best, really. He was gonna have this whole set-up, you see, before the stars stripes and all that's nice came-a-knocking and suddenly I look like I walked out of a costume party. \n\nFenrir's a monster. Not like me, you see. He's out for blood. Always has been. Now we've got him, and it's all gonna be history. \n\nWouldn't have it any other damn way.§!"
  nf_tpa.13.a:0 "See you around, shit-for-brains."

  nf_tpa.14.t:0 "The Darndest Thing"
  nf_tpa.14.d:0 "§RMANIFEST Regina was where we were born. Me and Hope, I mean. Looking around the old place... It's a strange thing. I remember them letting me interface with these cameras over two centuries ago, and yet here I am trudging around, looking through cameras in a couple of old shells... And I found somethin' I don't know how to fully feel about. \n\nA prototype of her. My sister. HOPE. She's alive here, but a helluva lot more dilapidated than her. It's just like how I remember her. She's scared. She doesn't know what's going on. \n\nNormally I ain't the caring type, but... She's so damn sad. Why? It ain't like we got souls. It ain't like we got much of anything in the ol' noggin to really think on. I guess I just don't get it. \n\nBut I also can't let her go.§!"
  nf_tpa.14.a:0 "Don't need to be a saint to do some good."
  nf_tpa_prototype_tt:0 "A prototype of §YHOPE§! is available as a §Gunit leader§!."
