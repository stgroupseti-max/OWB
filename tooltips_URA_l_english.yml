  gabba_the_shepherd_decision_desc:0 "Every day sees some ferals start to drift away from the main body. Sometimes a large handful, sometimes even only a single ghoul. Regardless, they all need to be spotted and guided back to Fort Peck. For their sake - and others."

When smoothskins get too close to the borderline, though, all it takes is a malicious stare to send a piece of the Horde running them off.\n\nToday Gabba got some bad news: Capo is no where to be found, and we're worried he might have gone out past the signs. We can only hope he doesn't intend to hurt anyone."

  nf_ura.1.t:0 "What is That Light?"
  nf_ura.1.d:0 "Terror, absolute terror formed in me when I witnessed what I had worked so hard to prevent, something Cappa-Cola promised he would not do as I watched him leading my sweet innocent ghouls into tearing apart innocents; they knew no better, unable to control their rotting minds, ones not too dissimilar from my own. Nothing has filled me with more horror, and I mean nothing as I watch Cappa approach, dagger in hand, his blood-stained mouth creeping into a sadistic smile, as the other ghouls follow in his steps. \n\nNot stumbling upon my family being ripped apart, not my skin falling off in heaps, not me having to hold my face together with belts, or the prospect of losing my own mind to the radiation. \n\nNot a single one of these things has terrified me so deeply to my core, or broken my heart as terribly as I watched him plunge the dagger into my chest; the hordes of zombies flooding over the hills behind him, I assume to destroy the place I once called home, the place he hates. That is the last assumption I will ever make as I feel darkness flow around me, the only sensations remaining being my warm blood dripping down my torso, and his cold embrace.\n\nI suppose it is time for me to rest…"

  nf_ura.2.t:0 "A Family Worth Guiding"
  nf_ura.2.d:0 "Once, not too long ago, I had begun to doubt myself. My memory, mind, and perception of reality had begun to slip; I’m afraid I may have begun the process of becoming a feral myself, like the ghouls I shepherd. Ignorant of their past lives as humans, they meander, wandering as bloodthirsty beasts as many would tell you. \n\nIn my opinion, they are no more than ghosts, lashing out, enraged by a past they can no longer remember, one that haunts them themselves. But since they can’t remember the people that they’ve lost, the lives they’ve lived, they must wander, after the end of the world, looking for what they cannot recall.\n\nI had begun to forget people myself, my family that I once loved dearly. The ones whose deaths began my new life as a shepherd in the first place. That was until I met Cappa and the others in his group. Sane ghouls, who took upon my duty alongside me. As I grew closer to them, I was reminded of what it meant to be human, and although they sometimes disagree with my methods, I believe I have done the same for them. \n\nI am confident now that I have my full sanity, and my companions at my side, it is time to reach out to my old home in order to ensure their safety, as well as the safety of my newfound family."

  nf_ura.3.d:0 "Today a ghoul wandered into town. A terrible sight for many, as the rumors aren’t lost upon even the higher-ups in our government, a few of our peacekeepers began to harass the ghoul. That is until we reminded them of their duties, and that even though he was grotesque, he was a being worthy of respect, just like any other. \n\nUpon further inspection, he was trying to give us a letter, the terribly handwritten words ‘From: Gabba-Ghoul To: [Root.GetLeader]’ adorning it. Immediately we delivered it to the office of [Root.GetLeader] who told us it was a bid for a non-aggression pact with the ghoul horde to the south, who have apparently been led by a former friend of [Root.GetLeader] this whole time! Still, though, there are concerns from the people of Moosejaw on whether or not it’s a good idea to accept such a thing."

In fact, they didn't seem too happy to see a ghoul at all! I guess this means we can't expect things to get better for a while..."
