  URA_GABBAGHOUL_NAME: "Gabba-Ghoul"
  URA_GABBAGHOUL_DESC: "§G“No... no, no noooo, come here Gerald, yess yesss come here, you leave those smooth skins alone, go back to the Hazards. Ssuh-sorry folks.”§!\n\nOnce a Moosejaw citizen, Gabriel always had a soft place in his heart for ferals ghouls, often visiting the Silofields and observing through a scope the massive horde that called the irradiated area home to clear his mind. One day, after losing his family to old-world fanatics, he decided to visit the fields one last time, hoping to die from the radiation. He was content basking in the glow, rotting away in the grace of nature’s beauty, as in his mind, all things should be allowed to do; so that better things may rise in their place. Rotted, he did, becoming a ghoulish visage as he waited for a death that would never come. Eventually, he began to look at the horde as his new family, deciding he would not let the same tragedy befall them that struck his human one, becoming their shepherd and loving them immensely; even so far as to name them, teaching them as he went to speak his, one he began to forget himself, Gabba.\n\nFor many years, they lived in peace, avoiding humanity. With the arrival of the Church, he chose to lead them away from the dangers of interaction with society, herding the horde to Fort Peck, a company dumping site for MANIFEST, presenting them the horde as something to be feared for the protection of both the surrounding nations and the ghouls themselves. Locals began referring to the flock and area as the “Rad-Hazards” in relation to the many radiation warnings Gabba had placed around the area, becoming both a landmark and an obstacle to be avoided for those travelling the wastes. Living in peaceful, irradiated harmony with the land, Gabba hopes to ensure this peace lasts forever, but the horde is still feral, and he is only one man..."

  URA_CAPOCOOLO_NAME: "Capo-Cola"
  URA_CAPOCOLLO_DESC: "The Ghouls that marched toward Fort Peck after Gabba's arrival were always headed by a singular man, Capo-Cola. He guided the vast menagerie of ferals and tortured souls on their exodus to safety. Was he capable of intellectual thought? No one on the outside is quite sure, but every lost soul listened to his calls and orders as if he didn’t even need to lift a finger."

  URA_BADGRIEF_NAME: "Bad-Grief"
  URA_BADGRIEF_DESC: "Bad Grief is a poetic soul who speaks in theatrics and metaphors. He claims to be the progeny of the spirits that cursed Fort Peck and wishes to spread his elaborate gospel to even the simplest of minds. He has fitted his decaying body parts with metal prosthetics to mock his creators by proclaiming that he was the architect of his own flesh. Being the only doctor in a town full of rotting carcasses is a hard but rewarding job as he gets to bring home hundreds of limbs and organs at no cost to anyone but the poor soul he stole them from."

  URA_WONDERBULL_NAME: "Wonder-Bull"
  URA_WONDERBULL_DESC: "The rumours about the Wonder-Bull vary drastically in realism and insanity. The most prominent one is that it was sold to the town of Ophelm, this prized and glorious cattle was always popular with the residents even before it could tell fortunes. When the nukes began raining down on the town the Wonder-Bull did not cower at the sight of the atomic fires. After facing them head on it had emerged from the crater that formed near it years later and a newly changed creature began speaking in ritualistic tongues. How much of this is true? Who can really say."
