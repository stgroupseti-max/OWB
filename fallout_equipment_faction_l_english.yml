  basic_ballistic_weaponry_icon_blackpowder:0 "Black Powder Pistol"
  basic_ballistic_weaponry_icon_blackpowder_short:0 "Old Sidearm"
  basic_ballistic_weaponry_icon_blackpowder_desc:0 "The lack of resources, weapon knowledge and manufacturing availability made flintlocks a common sight amongst the Broken Coast. Beyond its simple sidearm function, a weighted grip makes it perfect for pistol-whipping during boarding, and a wide barrel let daring pirates load it with buckshot, before shredding any unlucky enemy in a blinding light and deafening blast."
  basic_ballistic_weaponry_icon_pipe_revolver:0 "Pipe Revolver"
  basic_ballistic_weaponry_icon_pipe_revolver_short:0 "Revolver"
  basic_ballistic_weaponry_icon_pipe_revolver_desc:0 "From need comes ingenuity. While the Timekeepers appreciate immense firepower, it is certainly hard to acquire it, much less standardize it. Using scrap metal and abandonned forge around their territory, they managed to manufacture this huge, bulky sidearm, barely holding together with every shot of its massive 200 grain .38 cartridge."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_10mm_classic:0 "Colt 6520 10mm Pistol"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_10mm_classic_short:0 "10mm Pistol"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_10mm_classic_desc:0 "Vault-Tec contracted arms development out to a large number of private contractors, and one of the best results of these contracts was the Colt 6520. Chambered in 10mm."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_10mm_nv:0 "N99 Service Pistol"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_10mm_nv_short:0 "10mm Pistol"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_10mm_nv_desc:0 "The standard issue, large-caliber sidearm of the United States Army before the apocalypse, this large-frame 10mm pistol was made first and foremost for stopping power, as well as mechanical reliability. The simple construction allowing for even the dumbest of grunts to clear jams or misfires is certainly appreciated, while the reinforced body can withstand the harshest of conditions. All those combined make it perfect for wasteland warfare."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_9mm_smg:0 "9mm Submachine Gun"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_9mm_smg_short:0 "9mm SMG"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_9mm_smg_desc:0 "The 9mm submachine gun is a small, yet capable weapon, able to empty a full magazine in under 3 seconds. The 9mm rounds are common and lightweight, making it even easier to spray-and-pray."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_caravan_shotgun_sturdy:0 "Caravan Shotgun"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_caravan_shotgun_sturdy_short:0 "Double-Barrel"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_caravan_shotgun_sturdy_desc:0 "A 12 gauge classic, the Caravan Shotgun sports an over-under design allowing for better sight plane, recoil control, as well as intuitive reloading, which quickly made it a Texan Brotherhood favourite. With the ammunition changed for quadruple 0 buckshot fired from a magnum shell, able to take a man's head clean off in a single shot, firepower certainly isn't an issue even with these old weapons."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_mna_9mm_pistol:0 "M&A 9mm Pistol"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_mna_9mm_pistol_short:0 "9mm Pistol"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_mna_9mm_pistol_desc:0 "Common sidearm of both military and police force alike, and chambered in one of the most prolific calibres in existence, this firearm is the perfect candidate for widespread adoption."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_sten:0 "Sten SMG"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_sten_short:0 "Sten"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_sten_desc:0 "Capable of firing custom-tooled 9mm, along with boasting a simple construction and compact design, this, gentlemen, is the Sten submachinegun! The proud result of in-house engineering, it is one of the finest weapons in the wastes able to provide continuous close-range automatic firepower. A single soldier equipped with it is will put fear into the heart of every man in your path, and all through Gente ingenuity! So, gentlemen, are you ready to sign?"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_44:0 ".44 Revolver"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_44_short:0 ".44"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_1_44_desc:0 "As improvements came along to the standard Timekeeper weaponry, a massive change was in order. The proper metal frame, reinforced cylinder, and elongated barrel makes this weapon a sight to behold. Firing the same .38 caliber cartridge, with improved recoil control and accuracy, means the same devastating stopping power in a reliable package."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_44_upgraded:0 "Improved .44 Revolver"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_44_upgraded_short:0 ".44 Improved"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_44_upgraded_desc:0 "Very little can be considered "improvement" when it comes to Timekeeper weaponry, at least to them. As such, this sidearm was only called "Improved" when a crafty weaponsmith managed to have what amounts to a battle pistol fire a 350 grain, .44 cartridge without the whole gun going up with his hands. While pre-war movies tended to exaggerate their effect, this revolver can actually blow someone clear across a room."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_dakka:0 "Blackjack Assault Shotgun"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_dakka_short:0 "Assault Shotgun"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_dakka_desc:0 "A rugged, magazine-fed, ultra-compact shotgun, the Blackjack fires a standard twelve gauge round out of a minimum-spec barrel, allowing maximum dispersion at close quarter. The reinforced frame, lack of stock, and short profile makes it a perfect weapon for drive-by shooting, as well as bashing someone's eye socket in. Add a bayonet, and you got a wonderful pocket eviscerator."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_m16a1:0 "M16A1"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_m16a1_short:0 "M16"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_m16a1_desc:0 "The result of scavenging and study of mothballed army equipment depots, the M16A1 is able to be manufactured easily and simply. An improved variant of the base M16 benefiting from a forward assist and improved internal components, it still features a 5.56mm assault rifle platform in a stable, accurate, and now highly reliable package. Perfectly suited for medium range, its full auto feature still lets it be devastating in room clearing."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_medicine_stick:0 "Medicine Stick"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_medicine_stick_short:0 "Brush Gun"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_medicine_stick_desc:0 "Bringing a touch of old-world western action to post-war firefights, the updated 1886 Winchester is a classic appreciated by just about any tribal able to afford them. With a good rate of fire for a manually-cycled weapon, high accuracy, and tweaked iron sights, its suited for just about any situation encountered in the wasteland. Chambered for the powerful .45-90 Express, the cartridge is made to take down large predators such as Yao-Guai, deathclaws, or idiots in heavy armor."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_paciencia:0 "Paciencia Rifle"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_paciencia_short:0 "AM Rifle"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_paciencia_desc:0 "Few adversaries would consider a hunting rifle to be dangerous, yet they are gravely mistaken. Its threat comes from the fact it is a rechambered bolt-action, made to fire a shortened anti-material round able to pierce straight through most obstacles, and even light armor. What it gains in recoil, it makes up for in sheer firepower."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_service_rifle:0 "Service Rifle"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_service_rifle_short:0 "Service Rifle"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_2_service_rifle_desc:0 "A mainstay weapon of the pre-war US-Army, repaired and refurbished with Redwood furniture."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_3_assault_carbine:0 "Assault Carbine"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_3_assault_carbine_short:0 "Assault Carbine"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_3_assault_carbine_desc:0 "The assault carbine is a magazine-fed, compact automatic weapon with a high rate of fire and a comparatively low spread. It is one of the most accurate automatic weapons in the wasteland, and can be effectively used in close and medium range combat."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_3_p90:0 "P90 PDW"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_3_p90_short:0 "P90"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_3_p90_desc:0 "A highly advanced European weapon imported to the United States to arm special operation units, the P90 has been discovered in army facilities, and studied to be manufactured en-mass. Extremely compact, designed for penetration against armoured targets, and able to hold a staggering fifty 5.7mm cartridge, the high rate of fire combined with anti-armor capabilities make it the ultimate close range weapon."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_4_g11:0 "H&K G11"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_4_g11_short:0 "G11"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_4_g11_desc:0 "This gun revolutionized assault weapon design. The weapon fires a caseless cartridge consisting of a block of propellant with a bullet buried inside. The resultant weight and space savings allow this weapon to have a very high magazine capacity."
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_4_marksman_carbine:0 "Marksman Carbine"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_4_marksman_carbine_short:0 "Marksman Carbine"
  ballistic_weaponry_tech_icon_4_marksman_carbine_desc:0 "The marksman carbine is a semi-automatic, medium-power carbine with a 20 round magazine. Both highly accurate at long range and easy to handle in short range encounters, the marksman carbine is a precision weapon for a precision military."

  energy_weaponry_tech_icon_1_compliance_regulator_short:0 "Compliance Regulator"
  energy_weaponry_tech_icon_1_compliance_regulator_desc:0 "The Compliance Regulator was an electrolaser designed to use an electric current to stun targets, as a less-lethal method of apprehending suspects for the police or dealing with dangerous wildlife for park rangers. Its output can still cause severe injury or death with repeated exposure, but the ability to take a combatant out of a fight for a few moments can make it more useful than lethal lasers under the right circumstances."
  energy_weaponry_tech_icon_1_pistol:0 "Laser Pistol"
  energy_weaponry_tech_icon_1_pistol_short:0 "Laser Pistol"
  energy_weaponry_tech_icon_1_pistol_desc:0 "The AER9 was actually not the top laser rifle in service at the time of the Great War. The model line went up to the state-of-the-art AER12, which saw service in a handful of speciality units. The reason that the AER9 is much more commonly found is that it was much sturdier and more reliable than the models that followed."
  energy_weaponry_tech_icon_1_wattz_1000:0 "Wattz Laser Pistol"
  energy_weaponry_tech_icon_1_wattz_1000_short:0 "Wattz Laser Pistol"
  energy_weaponry_tech_icon_1_wattz_1000_desc:0 "Cheap and easily manufactured, the Wattz 1000 Laser Pistol was common in the hands of both pre-war police and civilians. An increased wattage and focusing field adjustments even allow the weapon to compete with General Atomics' more potent AER line."
  energy_weaponry_tech_icon_2_wattz_2000:0 "Wattz 2000 Laser Rifle"
  energy_weaponry_tech_icon_2_wattz_2000_short:0 "Wattz 2000"
  energy_weaponry_tech_icon_2_wattz_2000_desc:0 "More akin to a sniper rifle than a standard-issue rifle, the Wattz 2000 is reknowned for its precision and accuracy over long distances. Its usage of microfusion cells make for powerful lasers that make the weapon effective against any foe in the hands of a proficient marskman."
  energy_weaponry_tech_icon_3_wattz_tactics:0 "Wattz 3000 Laser Rifle"
  energy_weaponry_tech_icon_3_wattz_tactics_short:0 "Wattz 3000"

  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_1_cultist_knife_short:0 "Cult Knife"
  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_1_cultist_knife_desc:0 "A magnificently crafted knife, its esotheric properties make any person in its presence feel unease and gnawing despair as its sight. The handle is made of polished bones, imbued with tainted blood to give it a red color, while a wave-bladed edge gives it a horribly wounding effect on strike, akin to a serrated edge. Perfect to spill blood in Its name."
  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_1_fishbone:0 "Fishbone"
  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_1_fishbone_short:0 "Fishbone"
  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_1_fishbone_desc:0 "Named for their menacing serrated edges and chalk white blades, fishbones are often made from the hulls of wrecked ships. Cheap, rusty metal often makes for the best shivs: the tetanus is an added bonus."

  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_2_conch_knife_short:0 "Conch Knife"
  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_2_conch_knife_desc:0 "One of the effects from the Great War was actually a warming of the seas. Two hundred years of no sea travel, warmer oceans and idle mutation has allowed the Anacapa Coral Reef System to spread across most of the western United States seaboard. Off the coast of Oregon tribals pick up bits of coral washed onto the sea for building construction, rituals and even armor and weapons!\nConch Knives are a part of this culture. Two pieces of shell grafted together with the conch shell in question being sharpened to a razor point these weapons made for effective slicing and dicing of any tribal, sacrifice or mutant."

  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_2_cultist_blade_short:0 "Cult Sword"
  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_2_cultist_blade_desc:0 "The cultist sword follows the tradition of venerating Its name even in warfare, but forgoes the esotheric shaped blade of its dagger counterpart for a straight serrated edge to more easily spill blood and tear flesh. With its handle shaped from the bones of heretics, and supernatural forces blessing the blade, its vile energy seeps into every warrior in its presence."

  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_2_machete_gladius_short:0 "Machete Gladius"
  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_2_machete_gladius_desc:0 "An improvement over the simple machete, the indentation on a machete gladius shifts weight towards the head of the blade - granting superior striking power."

  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_3_bumper_sword_short:0 "Bumper Sword"
  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_3_bumper_sword_desc:0 "The bumper sword, as the name suggests, consists of a rusty car bumper that has been flattened and sharpened into a thick, heavy blade. The license plate is still attached, and an exhaust pipe strapped to the unsharpened end serves as a makeshift handle."

  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_4_displacer_short:0 "Displacer Glove"
  melee_weaponry_tech_icon_4_displacer_desc:0 "The displacer glove creates a shock wave upon impact similar to the one made by the Gauss rifle, both dealing a large amount of damage and pushing a target back. It possibly accomplishes this via a sonic blast, shown by the speaker on the knuckle."

From Anchorage to Shanghai, from Washington to L.A., this gun has both seen it all and done it all. Easy enough to maintain and chambered in the ubiquitous 10 milllimetre, its user can rest easy knowing that they'll never run out of ammo while having enough stopping power in one mag to drop a whole raider band or enemy squad."

Chambered in 12.7 millimetre and shorter than an Assault Carbine, the 12.7's overwhelming stopping power could put down a super mutant. The recoil is hard to control, but there's no denying this weapon's capability. Ideal for close-quarters combat and urban combat, this weapon is perfect for enforcing the peace in dense population centers and maintaining order at vital military installations."

The 25 millimetre grenade utilized has a velocity that surpasses the low-velocity 40-millimetre ones used in underslung launchers, and the APW also takes a large variety of grenade types such as smoke, pulse, plasma, incendiary, and riot foam, and therefore increases the number of viable targets that the grenadier can engage. The sheer number of potential applications the APW has makes squad level tactics and engagements that much more flexible, and it will certainly dislodge our troops out of sticky situations, or enemies out of entrenched fortifications."

Named so after its 16-round drum magazine, the RGL takes the same variety of grenades as the APW, but only upgraded to low-velocity 40 millimetre, ensuring the user explosive supremacy in close-quarters combat. Whether out on patrol, in pacification efforts, in urban combat, or in straight-up demolitions work, this weapon is pretty close to perfection. In a freshly trained private's hands, it can turn him into a good demoman, and in a good demoman's hands...well, you better not ask what makes him so good; the Auto-Thumper's already got that answered for you."

It's no wonder that Curators on the frontline have fallen in love with it; there's nothing better to get yourself out of a Faceless horde than a weapon that does nothing but rip and tear until it's done."
