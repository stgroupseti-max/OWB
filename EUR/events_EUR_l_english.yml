 nf_eureka.0.t: "Sea Claws and Long Fangs"
 nf_eureka.0.d: "The nuclear devastation that awaited Eureka was avoided, but at a great cost. The missile was off target, and instead slammed into the waters outside the city's port. While the radiation effects alone were enough to kill or incapacitate many, the horrors that emerged from the diseased sea were nearly extraterrestrial. Worst of all, Eureka had survived primarily through fishing and trading through its port, making even the existence of these mutated creatures a threat to their survival. The Portmasters held together in this time, a local militia which protected us all. Under the Portmasters' guidance, we learned..."
 nf_eureka.0.a: "...To trust each other"
 nf_eureka.0.b: "...To never give up"
 nf_eureka.0.c: "...To rebuild whatever we could"

 nf_eureka.1.t: "A Regulated Industry"
 nf_eureka.1.d: "There is an old Eurekan saying - 'peace is good for business; war is good for business.' The crew from Eureka's marina took control of the town after the bombs fell. But the lands around Eureka were too poor, and too lightly populated, to rule anyone. Why bother? Instead, the marina began offering themselves out for 'protection'. A season campaigning, then a return home for the winter. In a mere generation they were known as the Portmasters, a rough and ready band.\n\nBut the Portmasters had their limitations. Eureka lacked heavy weaponry or advanced schematics, and faced the chance of falling behind. And so in 2150, a new gang came to Eureka.\n\nThe Regulators were once the heroes of the Boneyard, a militia company who kept the town safe. But in 2141 the Vault Dweller, corrupted by the honeyed words of local raiders, turned the town against them. The men and women who fought and died to keep one of California's first towns safe fled as far as they could go, looking for a home. And they found one in Eureka. To quote Caleb, 'this is a good and peaceful place - here I shall rest my gun above the mantle.' "
 nf_eureka.1.a: "They brought special forces training."
 nf_eureka.1.b: "They taught us how to hold a position."
 nf_eureka.1.c: "We learned how to live off the land."

 nf_eureka.2.t: "The Turning Wheel"
 nf_eureka.2.d: "The Regulators weren't the only Californians to flee to Eureka, seeking a better life. Beginning in the 2240s, the Hubologists walked north, seeking a land free of the Shi's persecution.\n\nThe Hubologists are called 'con artists' and charlatans, but that is base slander. They believe that life, the universe, and everything are a turning wheel. With their scientific beliefs, the children of Dick Hubbell tried to cleanse the Wasteland of the neurodynes that almost destroyed mankind. But Thrakazog the Pot Hole stuck our wheel, and his agent from Arroyo drove us out of San Francisco. To Eureka we came, and Eureka we remain. It is in this little town that the Hubologists work for the Great Uplifting, and to bring us home to the Star Father on Quetzel."
 nf_eureka.2.a: "Down with the Oppressives!"

 nf_eureka.3.t: "Payment Received"
 nf_eureka.3.d: "Our volunteers have been sent out and are currently en route to their future hosts. Already, we've received the down payment promised to us. Yet the spoils of war are ever bountiful, and increasing the capabilities of our generals will lead to future spoils."
 nf_eureka.3.a: "For Eureka!"

 nf_eureka.4.t: "The Spoils of War"
 nf_eureka.4.d: "The growing strength of our generals has led to an increase in loot captured while in the field. These spoils have been shipped home to us, enriching our treasury and our people."
 nf_eureka.4.a: "For Eureka!"

 nf_eureka.5.t: "Dubious Prospects"
 nf_eureka.5.d: "While our team managed to uncover some usable support equipment, most of what they found was in deep disrepair. Our current lack of materials and knowledge means that we'll need to make a difficult decision between the groups of specialized support equipment that we managed to recover."
 nf_eureka.5.a: "Fireteam and Dogs"
 nf_eureka.5.b: "Anti-tank and Demolitions"
 nf_eureka.5.c: "Actually, we can do both!"

 nf_eureka.6.t: "The Business of Redding Is Business"
 nf_eureka.6.d: "As Eureka's economy opened, three investors approached the City's leaders with a plan.\n\nTwo twins, Olivia and Cordell, came with their retinues. A battalion of clerks, guards, and builders, behind two unique plans. Olivia's promise was simple - improve the infrastructure to improve exports to New California. Her brother, a student at Vault City University, proposed looking for gold. After all, Redding once had some, and the region was once the source of gold centuries ago. Surely some was left?\n\nBut there was also a third proposal, one that disgusted Granite. A super mutant known only as Francis claimed the super mutants from Broken Hills could use their skills to run the mine. From a strict cost-benefit analysis, the mutants would be an invaluable tool. But hadn't these monsters killed thousands?"
 nf_eureka.6.a: "Olivia's solution is practical"
 nf_eureka.6.b: "Cordell, sign me up!"
 nf_eureka.6.c: "Super mutants can lift *how much*?"

 nf_eureka.7.t: "Who to Approach?"
 nf_eureka.7.d: "A war of influence has recently broken out over the small state of [FOU.GetName]. Seemingly insignificant, the area is actually a valuable trading route for caravans traveling from Redding to Arroyo. Both nations would benefit massively from dominating the outpost, and our reputation might be enough to shift the tides towards one of them. Of course, we have no interest in [FOU.GetName]. It's far too remote, and has little value to us. We do, however, stand to benefit from one of the competitor's patronage. We could approach one of them, offering support for their cash."
 nf_eureka.7.a: "We should meet with Arroyo"
 nf_eureka.7.b: "Send a message to the NCR"

 nf_eureka.8.t: "Eureka Offers Support"
 nf_eureka.8.d: "Our campaign for control over Fourways stands to benefit from Eureka's recent offer of diplomatic support. Accepting their offer could go a long ways towards ending the standoff peacefully, but Eureka has made sure to attach a price tag. The mercenaries are force enough in the region to make their offer worth considering, but our advisors are divided on whether it should be outright agreed to, given the money needed for such a deal."
 nf_eureka.8.a: "We graciously accept their proposal."
 nf_eureka.8.b: "Eureka? Who is that again?"

 nf_eureka.9.t: "Deal Accepted"
 nf_eureka.9.d: "[FROM.GetName] has wisely agreed to our proposed plan. Offering them support over the [FOU.GetName] issue has cost us little, but we should be mindful of the changing circumstances in the region. Whoever wins the struggle for [FOU.GetName] might turn their attention towards us next, after all."
 nf_eureka.9.a: "A pleasure doing business."

 nf_eureka.10.t: "Deal Declined"
 nf_eureka.10.d: "[FROM.GetName] foolishly declined our offer of support. All this has cost us is time and effort, but it is a stinging blow nevertheless."
 nf_eureka.10.a: "On to other matters."

 nf_eureka.11.t: "Eureka Offers a Non-aggression Pact"
 nf_eureka.11.d: "A messenger from the port city of Eureka has reached Arroyo and seems to be offering a non-aggression pact between our two nations. This would probably be a temporary solution to the growing conflict between our two nations, but it could benefit us to accept this arrangement while we focus on other concerns."
 nf_eureka.11.a: "We accept, for now."
 nf_eureka.11.b: "No, but you will see us soon"

 nf_eureka.12.t: "Deal Declined"
 nf_eureka.12.d: "Arroyo has spurned our reasonable diplomatic gestures. It seems that our estimation of them was completely wrong, and that they do only see us as a future target. We will have to prepare for what is certain to be an oncoming conflict."
 nf_eureka.12.a: "Then it is war."

 nf_eureka.13.t: "Eureka's Mercenary Army"
 nf_eureka.13.d: "Eureka works differently from almost any other nation. Instead of a normal standing army they are involved in conflicts across the west coast in exchange for cash and army experience. They cannot train new divisions regularly and have extremely limited industry, but instead raise divisions and equipment through special decisions.\n\nMercenaries can be sent through the Send Volunteers button on the diplomacy screen. Sending mercenaries (so long as the nation does not already have mercenaries from Eureka) results in an automatic payment of 40 dollars, and levelling up your starting generals provides an additional payment of 25 dollars. Only your starting generals and those gained by focuses and events grant the 25 dollar payment.\n\nYou must have a presence in a nation's port in order to send them mercenaries. At game start, Eureka has built a presence from the southern tip of Baja to the Washington Brotherhood's Capitol Hill. Focuses may expand your reach to new ports, and therefore new conflicts."
 nf_eureka.13.a: "I see."

 nf_eureka.14.t: "Too Close to Home"
 nf_eureka.14.d: "The quiet evening was blasted awake by an indescribable explosion at our port in Eureka. The fishermen unloading their boats after a long day of work were killed almost instantly. A ship of mercenaries, returning home on leave and excited to see their families, were suddenly returned to the battlefields they had escaped, with many suffering grievous or fatal wounds. The initial horror began to be replaced by despair, and then rage, as responders found a sickly green murk spreading from nearby the site of the explosion - a clear sign that contaminants had been carefully included in the source of the explosion. This was no mistake, or accident. This was an act of terror."
 nf_eureka.14.a: "Remember this."

 nf_eureka.15.t: "Remains of Expertise"
 nf_eureka.15.d: "Once our response efforts turned from rescue to investigation a number of disturbing facts became clear. First, this was no accident. The port overseers have long been well aware of the Eurekan port's importance to our city, and would never have allowed dangerous material to be stored there. Second, the attack had been carefully planned. We were unable to find any solid leads or any evidence left behind, meaning the planners were professionals. One of our neighbours must be responsible for this, as the contaminants were no doubt deliberately included to damage the port. Between our two greatest threats, the NCR and Arroyo, there is one clear suspect. The NCR is far too preoccupied with the Mojave to turn their attention to us, while Arroyo is practically searching for an excuse to march their armies into our territory."
 nf_eureka.15.a: "They will pay."

 nf_eureka.16.t: "Arroyo Asks for Submission"
 nf_eureka.16.d: "A delegation from Arroyo formally approached Portmaster Smith today, offering him and Eureka a place in an 'Arroyan Confederation', led by Arroyo itself. At face value, this is an insulting question, especially considering our steadfast focus on remaining independent from subjugation. After further discussion, however, it seems that we have much to gain if we agree to their proposal. Arroyo is willing to invest heavily in our land. They would also allow us to maintain our mercenary army, and grant us access to more fishing waters.\n\nIf we do choose to resist, we will be forced to do so violently. Simply declining the offer would lead to a steady erosion of our control, and an eventual de facto takeover. Our continued independence means there must be war."
 nf_eureka.16.a: "Arroyo's offer is reasonable"
 nf_eureka.16.b: "We shall never bow to anyone!"
 nf_eureka.16.c: "We are already under NCR protection"

 nf_eureka.18.t: "HEY! HEY ARADORN!"
 nf_eureka.18.d: "You were just walking around the wasteland and heard someone yelling at you with a name other than yours. Turn around to see it's a child with curly hair. Wait a minute, is he actually a child? I mean he is short and all but his face looks like an adult and OH GOD WHAT ARE THOSE BIG AND HIDEOUS FEET WHY IS HE NOT WEARING SHOES OH MY GOD! He then says "Wait you are not Aradorn, who are you?" then runs away before you could answer. A weird and skinny ghoul hisses at you while running away with him."
 nf_eureka.18.a: "Hey kid, wait up, who is this Araborn?"
 nf_eureka.18.b: "What in the goddamn?"

 nf_eureka.19.t: "What's That on the Ground?"
 nf_eureka.19.d: "You were walking on the same spot you saw that weird kid and ghoul yesterday and found a shiny ring on the ground. It has a small chain going through it too. Probably the dumb kid dropped it. You just sell it to a random merchant for some cash."
 nf_eureka.19.a: "Ka-ching"

 nf_eureka.20.t: "The Tales of Granite Company"
 nf_eureka.20.d: "'Kiss America Goodbye, Boys'.\n\nThese were Granite's last words as the Rig exploded, and his boys and girls fled Navarro. While hardliners fled east to Chicago and the Capital, Granite led those who either couldn't reach the evac zones or didn't want to. A group left behind, forgotten. Of course they turned to the Wasteland's most precious commodity - war.\n\nFor three decades, the Granite Company fought and died, carefully maintaining failing power armour, as the radio carried words of a new president in the East. Some heroes, devoted to fighting the mutant threat, traveled on. Some of them stayed and died. After years of fighting, there was no one left devoted to the Enclave's dreams.\n\nThe Granite Company had many customers, but a few rules stood out."
 nf_eureka.20.a: "Granite would fight for anyone, no questions asked."
 nf_eureka.20.b: "But he especially disliked the dogs of the NCR."

 nf_eureka.21.t: "Eureka!"
 nf_eureka.21.d: "Granite Company drifted through the Wastes for decades; but there was never a great place to find a home. Reno was too hot once the Salvatores fell from power. Vault City attracted some, but the NCR garrison made many veterans uncomfortable. Seattle? A nice place, before the Brotherhood showed up. MacArthur? Technically, Granite Company committed treason aiding the Chosen One in killing Frank Horrigan. What to do?\n\nBy this point, Eureka was home to several groups of mercenaries. What was one more? And so the last Enclave troops on the west coast set themselves up as mercenaries in the 'bum fuck of nowhere.'"
 nf_eureka.21.a: "Old Soldiers Never Die . . . "
 nf_eureka.21.b: "They Just Fade Away"

 nf_eureka.22.t: "Fortunate Son"
 nf_eureka.22.d: "Granite grew up on the campaign trail with his father, learning from radical officers, malcontent grunts, and jaded Followers. He piloted vertibirds to Koover, supped with Rio soldiers along the river, and learned much from the people. Much to his father's chagrin, he went, in a way, native. But he never placed roots, and never found a home. Granite Company just marched the Wastes, the only constant being cash for the soldiers, and taps for the fallen. Until a chill day in November 2274, when the taps played for Granite.\n\nAnd so passed the last American. For Granite Company, and the last of the Western Enclave, it was up to Granite to write the epilogue."
 nf_eureka.22.a: "He's tenting on the old camp ground."

 nf_eureka.23.t: "In the Lair of the Bear"
 nf_eureka.23.d: "As the years went on, Eureka ran into a problem - the NCR was too damn successful. Who needed to hire mercenaries when California had a standing army of thousands of men with bloody mechanized units? Protecting brahmin caravans was well and good, but it couldn't pay the way raiding Vault City once did. The NCR increasingly viewed Eureka as an inconvenience and embarrassment, a den of trouble on its borders. Indeed, some felt it was only a matter of time before the NCR simply occupied Eureka to restore order. Some mercenaries moved east or north, while others cashed out.\n\nAnd a few wondered if Eureka would have to find some other way to support itself. But whatever Eureka did would attract the NCR's interest, and there was a chance the Republic would simply solve the problem once and for all."
 nf_eureka.23.a: "Small businessmen always get the short end of the stick."
 nf_eureka.23.a_tt: "Unlocks the §YHide Activities from NCR§! decision.\nThis allows you to spend £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! or £currency_NCR_text_icon §Ycash§! to keep the NCR from mobilizing against you. Certain actions will increase the NCR's suspicion, such as flying around in vertibirds."

 nf_eureka.24.t: "Operational Security Compromised!"
 nf_eureka.24.d: "Mr. President, we are hearing disturbing reports of NCR radio chatter in reference to our facilities. We have also received one report of an NCR spy stumbling into one of our conference rooms, completely unaware of where exactly he was. Needless to say, the NCR is sure to notice something is terribly wrong if we don’t act now. Continuing to operate as normal may have dire consequences."
 nf_eureka.24.a: "The time has come."

 nf_eureka.24.f: "Cease Construction efforts."

 nf_eureka.25.t: "Going North, the Rush Is On"
 nf_eureka.25.d: "With the growth of the Californian economy, it is time to open a new frontier to satisfy the appetites of southern California. Until now, Eureka was too remote and had little to offer the lands down south. There was ample farm land for staples, and no real market for luxury goods. But that has changed, and it opens an interesting opportunity.\n\nEureka could grow to rely upon resources and goods beyond manpower and mercenaries. The fish of the sea; the fruit of the land; and perhaps, with some hard work, the sweat of its people's brow. But to do that will require more settlers. Granite and [EUR.GetLeader], as the strongest forces in Eureka, are at an impasse. [EUR.GetLeader] believes all are welcome, and would encourage everyone to immigrate. But Granite believes that Eureka should limit immigration to a respectable sort, hard working, industrious, relatively successful peoples. 'We are not the Legion - we have no need of serfs.' Ultimately, who will prevail?\n\nAnd perhaps, just perhaps, Granite could send some feelers out to old friends."
 nf_eureka.25.a: "The more the merrier!"

 nf_eureka.26.t: "I Met You in a Bar in San Francisco..."
 nf_eureka.26.d: "San Francisco has long served as a gateway to the north, and in happier times served as a popular spot for Navarro's leave. Now Eureka hopes to attract investment and trade from the city, with several factions available. The Shi are always happy to trade for more produce and lumber, and offer their technological services. But they were never friends of Granite Company's predecessors, convinced that the Enclave almost nuked San Francisco. The Hubologists, for their part, know much about aviation. But not too much. And we must admit, their religious views are strange even for the Wasteland. Still, they would work with Granite Company.... Who does Eureka pick?"
 nf_eureka.26.a: "Blessings to the Emperor."
 nf_eureka.26.b: "Surely there's something to this Star Father business?"

 nf_eureka.27.t: "Uneasy Neighbours"
 nf_eureka.27.d: "One reason Granite Company settled down in Eureka was the Sergeant's willingness to work with mutants, a tradition that existed since the fall of the Rig. While obviously ghouls and super mutants were potential threats, Granite could be perfectly civil and pleasant, setting an example for those who followed. Indeed, Granite and the Portmasters went on more than one successful venture together, especially a spectactular raid on the Great Eighties in 2268.\n\nBut this is not to deny that the two groups have tensions. In particular, Granite Company is far less willing to work with the Republic, preferring a stand-off approach for their little town. But for now, this remains a theoretical disagreement. Both parties recognize that any conflict might ruin their little community, and neither group wants to invite the NCR north. And hey, some of the ghouls can make a pretty good rotgut."
 nf_eureka.27.a: "They may be muties, but they're our muties."

 nf_eureka.28.t: "Ghoul Attack!"
 nf_eureka.28.d: "'Your ride's over, smoothskin!' screamed one of the Portmasters as he opened fire at the Sergeant. The first shot missed, but the second grazed his Granite's chest. The wound was not fatal, but it came with a cost and a scar - a bitter reminder, perhaps, that ghouls cannot be trusted.' While [EUR.GetLeader] pleads apologetics, and claims it was an unfortunate vigilante, perhaps this is a sign that firmer action is needed."
 nf_eureka.28.a: "They got two shots - there will not be a third."
 nf_eureka.28.b: "Keep this quiet."

 nf_eureka.29.t: "For Auld Lang Syne"
 nf_eureka.29.d: "It was regrettable, it was unfortunate, it was too easy. [POR.GetLeader] and his men kept lax security the night of the assault. They were an elite, almost as skilled as the NCR's rangers. But against Granite Company, equipped with Van Graff energy weapons? The fools didn't even keep a perimeter up. For the cost of a few dozen ghouls and a soldier who stubbed his toe, Granite Company seized Eureka. And finished the debate over Navarro once and for all."
 nf_eureka.29.a: "A regrettable necessity."
 nf_eureka.29.b: "I told you you wouldn't get a third shot."

 nf_eureka.30.t: "Operational Security Compromised!"
 nf_eureka.30.d: "Corporal, it appears that the Rangers picked up on our activities. Apparently some bloody mailman walked into one of our conference rooms and found the commemorative Enclave coffee mugs. Even now, he's heading to Shady Sands to report our overt Enclave presence to [NCR.GetLeader], doubtless in hopes of a reward. Needless to say, the NCR is sure to notice something is terribly wrong if we don’t act now. Continuing to operate as normal may have dire consequences."

 nf_eureka.31.d: "Mr. President, if you're reading this report, it appears that the Granite Company is operating out of Eureka. Which we knew. But more seriously, it seems they are taking aggressive actions which, if left unchecked, could pose a threat to the Republic. Although obviously we aren't concerned about a handful of mercenaries, this is honestly an affront to the flag."

 nf_eureka.32.d: "Nevada heard our call! The people of the region heard our plans to develop Eureka's economy, and we have three groups with interest.\n\nModoc sends a farming delegation, which would support our agricultural exports.\n\nVault City sends some citizens, cutting edge researchers who may, alas, dislike our ghoul population.\n\nAnd Reno sent some well funded chem manufacturers. Who do we pick?"
 nf_eureka.32.a: "Farming ain't much, but it's honest work. For other people."

 nf_eureka.33.d: "If we want to rebuild Navarro, we need to do so in a pluralistic manner that benefits every stakeholder. In practice, this means making sure everyone gets a slice of the California cake. But what to do? How do we tame this wilderness?\n\nThe Portmasters would simply open the frontier to all who want to come, including those with an eccentric past. The Regulators wish to import slaves for crash industrialization and mining, and profit off their labour. Granite, for his part, wants to attract a better class of citizen by emulating the Vault City model. Which will we pursue?"
 nf_eureka.33.a: "Welcome, new citizens!"

 nf_eureka.34.t: "The Doctor Is In"
 nf_eureka.34.d: "We've made contact with one of the Enclave's old physicians, Dr. Henry! This is a great coup for the Encl-ah, Granite Company. Dr. Henry researched cyber-genetics, and before his departure proposed a radical theory that the Wastelanders were not, in fact, a separate species but still genetically human. Once derided for assuming that the ability to interbreed, nigh-identical DNA, and sapience indicated that the mainlanders were genetically salvageable, he now has a use! In exchange for working for Granite Company, we will pardon him for escaping.\n\nWhile he may quibble about being found by an 'extraction squad,' he can do a lot of good for the people of Navarro. And if we were truly villains, would we provide medical care to the families of those who support us?"

 nf_eureka.35.d: "[EUR.Getleader] always had an ambiguous relationship with Arroyo. Granite Senior always said the Chosen One was the finest mutie he ever met, and Granite Company took more than one contract with Arroyo. But other members of the Company said Arroyo blew up the Rig, a terrorist attack against peaceful scientists. facility. Who could be so monstrous?\n\nTensions only worsened as time went on. Arroyo's warriors concoted tales tales of an Enclave so irredeemably black as to be, frankly, ludicrous. After one visit when he was six the nice lady in Arroyo stopped sending Granite candy; and his father was very silent for the next few days. And after an attack in Nevada by Arroyo's warriors under a chieftain named Kaga, it became clear that Arroyo could not be trusted.\n\nStill, peace might have prevailed. Until that fateful day, when an Arroyan warrior fired at a member of the Granite Company along the border. When Granite received word of the attack at Navarro, he stood silent for a moment. And then he said, quite calmy, "don't mess with this man's army.""

Shall a radstag thank a hunter for not taking a shot?\n\nNow his son gathers his tribe to his south, the ghost soldiers who once menaced California.

No longer will he shoot Rangers and drug dealers. But what do we do with their principality of pestilence?\n\nOne option; although Granite, like all good Americans, opposes slavery, the Thirteenth Amendment makes clear that forced labour by criminals is legal. And leaving aside several decades of unpaid taxes, these monsters destroyed the Rig! They killed the President! We would be justified to sell them into slavery and use the proceeds to rebuild America.\n\nBut perhaps that is wrong; while the Chosen One had to die for his crimes, Granite is not going to judge an entire people for how they treated him as a child. One cannot hug a child with nuclear arms. Offering self rule to Arroyo under the Granite Company's protection, respecting their religious beliefs, and showing clemency - are these not American ideals?\n\nPerhaps.

 nf_eureka.40.t: "Shady Sands Imperialism"
 nf_eureka.40.d: "It appears that [NCR.GetLeader] is no fool, and prohibited Redding's merchants from working with us. Most unfortunate. But on the up side, this alienated a lot of their support in Redding. Dealing with internal dissension will mean the Bear will be less interested in our activity for quite some time."

 nf_eureka.41.t: "Indigestion"
 nf_eureka.41.d: "With our victory in Navarro, we pulled off a miracle! We drove the NCR back and claimed Navarro as our buffer. Granite's men are setting up shop in Navarro, but now we're running into a bit of a mess. There are still thousands of people in the territory who hate each other, in a land with vast potential and promise. If we withdraw from the region the NCR or Shi will simply pour back in. And of course, if we manage it properly everyone in Eurkea will be set for life. What do we do?"
 nf_eureka.41.a: "...I didn't sign up for nation building!"
 nf_eureka.41.b: "But will we ever find our home among the stars?"

 nf_eureka.42.t: "Back to School"
 nf_eureka.42.d: "If Eureka is going to remain a force to be recokoned with as the Wasteland transitions to nations and empires, we're going to need guns. Heavy guns. Lots of heavy guns. But how?\n\nThere are a few ideas worth exploring, but they divided the cabal that runs Eureka. Granite pushes for ties with Vault City, or perhaps with some friends out east. The Portmasters are willing to cut a deal with the NCR, offering assistance to the OSI in exchange for subsidies to Shady Sands. And the Regulators? Well, they've got an idea.\n\nThe Shi were once masters of scientific innovation, with plans for space ships, new fuel sources, and more. But instead, their leadership fell under the sway of dueling dojos. While research continues, the bright promise of the Shi has dimmed. Perhaps some of them would prefer a land where nobody is kung fu fighting?"

 nf_eureka.43.t: "I Left My Heart in San Francisco"
 nf_eureka.43.d: "San Francisco is dear to many of Eureka's contingent. The Hubologists once stood on the Golden Gate to watch the stars collide. Granite Company shipped supplies to their outpost across the sea. And the Regulators passed through decades ago on their march north. A rich, prosperous city, before the Shi's gangs tore it apart. But what shall we do with the Steel Palace? And the Emperor?\n\nGranite Company would use the Emperor to serve their interests, calculating the secrets of their old friends on the West Coast. The Hubologists would use him to search for a better way to clenase humans of neurodynes. And the Regulators? They would simply sell him to the Brotherhood, and scrap him for parts.\n\nAnd sadly, of course, the NCR will be furious that we've sacked one of their major trading partners. Perhaps they are mobilizing for war even now!"

 nf_eureka.44.t: "The Only Game in Town"
 nf_eureka.44.d: "The problem, you see, is that everyone else in Eureka was crazy. The Hubologists wanted purify neurodynes with MORE radiation. Granite chased the ghost of a dead world. And the Regulators thought they could become friends with the NCR, earning the trust of their ancient foes. All were fools. San Francisco had much of value; tech that the Shi and Hubologists would have wasted. And the NCR meant the age of mercenaries in California drew to a close. But abroad? Well, there would always be need of a gun. Why not see who else needed a hand?"
 nf_eureka.44.a: "War never changes - but our price might."

 nf_eureka.45.t: "The Boys Are Back in Town"
 nf_eureka.45.d: "The Boneyard never truly appreciated us, but the Regulators kept order and saved them. How fitting that we should do so once again. No longer spurned by the NCR, no longer mercenaries. No, today - and tomorrow - we are the heroes of California. We tamed the North and did what they could not; and we'll keep on doing that, until the Republic gives us our due."

 nf_eureka.46.d: "The spirits of the dead are constantly trying to influence us. They reach into our brain and alter our chemistry to create neurodynes. Zeta radiation destroys some and drives the spirits away, but only for a short time.\n\nWith our victory, the people are free of neurodynes once and for all, and we can pursue the Hub's grand plan. We will not just reach for Quetzal; we will build a Quetzal in the Wasteland, freeing our mind. They said the shuttle would never fly. They laughed at us. But now our brave astro-men set forth on a transcendant journey, and found the secrets of the star child.\n\nNow our sky wheel is in motion, and it will roll over all who oppose us. Quetzal, your time will come soon! "

 nf_eureka.47.d: "The Chosen One - the NCR - the Brotherhood. They all stood against the Enclave, and our effort to save the Wasteland, America, and mankind. We cannot, perhaps, ever revive the dreams and glories of the past. But we can at least honour the flags of our father. Even now, Granite's supporters spread across the NCR. They shall make a peace in this blasted desert. For how else can one save democracy?"

 nf_eureka.48.t: "Plucking Victory from the Jaws of Defeat"
 nf_eureka.48.d: "The Navarro conflict was, of course, terrible. Even worse, it makes [NCR.GetLeader] look awful! How is he going to get reelected and focus people on the Mojave if a gang of bandits are now running the territory? Fortunately, it seems that [EUR.GetLeader] and the other members of his clicque are men of reason. They are willing to rule the territory in the Republic's name in exchange for a general amnesty and the rights of citizenship in the Republic. By accepting this offer, we will still gain access to the region's raw materials. A great plan, is it not?"

 nf_eureka.49.d: "It seems that the NCR has foolishly welcomed us into the fold as the Eureka territories. Now we can pursue our plans unmolested - and begin to dream of the greatest heist we've ever seen. The NCR thought it saw the last of us, and is about to find out just how wrong it was."
 nf_eureka.49.a: "Wait, now that we're all citizens..."

 nf_eureka.50.t: "Ruling New California"
 nf_eureka.50.d: "The records found in Shady Sands portray the Enclave in, obviously, a most unflattering light. They called us fanatics, fascists, and other horrible worlds. And to that end, while we know the NCR was a corrupt sclerotic regime that served the elites instead of the people, the deluded Wastelanders do not. To that end we face a massive insurgency across the entire Republic, and people have been heard saying 'Better Caesar's tunic than an Enclave cap.' And all we wanted to do was offer a cure for mutation!\n\nFortunately, we have a few options to help rule the territory. We could restore Regulator control to the Boneyard, letting our friends from Eureka protect their original homes. We could let Redding run itself as a puppet state. Or, perhaps, we could propose a deal with Hayes? Do we not work for the same ends, the restoration of American greatness?"
 nf_eureka.50.a: "The Regulators Have Served Us Well"

 nf_eureka.51.d: "Some call Anton Flynn a turncoat, but nothing could be further from the truth. He merely recognizes that the United States of America is the Wasteland's best hope for peace, and works with us to that end. He is a perfect examplar of the Enclave and California's destiny - no longer shall men such as he be bound by softhearted fools who ignore the cost of progress. Flynn is one of many patriots across New California who are willing to look past their provincial loyalties and work with Navarro to build a brighter future. Won't you, my fellow Americans, follow his example?"
 nf_eureka.51.a: "God Bless the Enclave."

 nf_eureka.52.t: "Ask Not What the Enclave Can Do to You"
 nf_eureka.52.d: "The Enclave is in your homes, and, we hope, in your hearts. Some of you may ask - what is the Enclave, to California? And why are we here?\n\nBy some lights the NCR succeeded in restoring civilization. Your homes were safer than your parents'. Your children went to school and lived, more often than not, to adulthood. But have they not let decadence and corruption fester? Do your leaders not let the undeserving profit off the sweat of your brow? Ghouls and super mutants, who could kill your loved ones. Anarchist moochers, who do not contribute to the great work. We will build a new world, protecting humanity. Protecting you."
 nf_eureka.52.a: "The Followers' radicalism threatened California for too long."

 nf_eureka.53.t: "A Pit of Vipers"
 nf_eureka.53.d: "Reno - a city of sin and squalor, of whores and wine. One wonders why we even need this city, given that Vegas offers the same services. Still, it has a taxable population, and someone, somewhere, might be worthy of saving in this filth. We have a few options to handle the city. We can keep it for ourselves, or we could turn it over to Vault City (assuming they are an ally). But why not let the Van Graffs run it? If anyone has value here, it is surely Tiaret - a woman of sufficient breeding and charisma that one assumes she has all her chromosones. And she was happy enough to support us when we took over the NCR."
 nf_eureka.53.a: "Reno is a useful forward outpost."

 nf_eureka.54.t: "FEV Curling-13"
 nf_eureka.54.d: "Our parents told us that the Rig was a research facility, designed to cure the Wasteland. But the Brotherhood's records tell a different tale - the Rig was a research lab for a biological weapon designed to kill millions of people. Many of us have grown up with Wasteland mothers and fathers; others were adopted or joined Granite Company's ranks. If these files are correct, had the Tribal failed we would be dead.\n\nReaction in Navarro is varied but grim. More than one officer has taken his own life - for if the story is true, what did we do? A band of mercenaries destroyed a nation which aspired to the ideals of America. That can't be true.\n\nIt isn't true, Granite realized. The Brotherhood and NCR hated the Enclave, and concocted a dark plot and propaganda to besmirch America's founders. Were mistakes made? Perhaps. Excesses, in pursuit of saving the nation? Maybe. But the story the files told could not be true.\n\nStill, piecing together the data gave the Enclave some unique ideas."

 nf_eureka.55.a: "Fascists, man."

 nf_eureka.56.t: "What the Hell?"
 nf_eureka.56.d: "I don't understand? Our men flew to MacArthur Base, and journeying across frozen peaks that spear the sky, and were greeted with... gunfire? Apparently mutineers who broke from the Enclave now rule the North, on behalf of a Reunited States of America. And a woman by the name of Martha Santiago wants us to know she is coming for us?"
 nf_eureka.56.a: "Okay, let's not try that again."

 nf_eureka.57.t: "....Wait, You Guys Survived?"
 nf_eureka.57.d: "Although we knew some stragglers and deserters stayed out west when Navarro fell, we are surprised to learn that they've retaken, umm, both Navarro and New California? This is a true testament to the spirit of the Enclave, and our commitment to freedom. Even if we have no clue who 'Sergeant Granite' was or why he's so special.\n\nRegardless, the least we can do is share some power armour schematics. And a fruit basket from the Garden of the Gods."
 nf_eureka.57.a: "...Technically, they're all deserters."

 nf_eureka.58.t: "We Got a Fruit Basket!"
 nf_eureka.58.d: "Despite the confusion in MacArthur, we were feted as heroes and wayward soldiers. Although a few bureacrats claimed we were, technically, deserters, the results speak for themselves. [MCA.GetLeader] even offered us a fruit basket, from a scientific facility containing plants not seen since the Great War. And also some suggestions for our power armour."
 nf_eureka.58.a: "Virtue is its own reward, but I really like mangos too."

 nf_eureka.59.t: "The Message from Chicago"
 nf_eureka.59.d: "Sadly, President Eden is too busy to meet with our scouts. Doubtless he is busy, for we hear he is preparing to defend the Capital Wasteland. Can you imagine that? When he succeeds, the Enclave will rule from Sea to Glowing Sea! What could be better?\n\nStill, the Secretary of the Interior was happy to send an aide to communicate. The corporal congratulated us on destroying the Lost Hills Bunker, as he fights with a Brotherhood chapter in Illinois as well. And he promises that we can take part in his Great Work very soon."
 nf_eureka.59.a: "God Bless the Enclave."

 nf_eureka.60.t: "Enclave Elections"
 nf_eureka.60.d: "Elections are one of the great things about America! Sadly, as our records show, the elections must be managed. We couldn't let people vote for their own leaders without proper guidance, after all, or they'd just vote back in the NCR leadership! Wouldn't that be hilarious? No, instead we will take care of the elections for them and cement Granite's position. Nevertheless, we can conduct surveys to show what would voters most care about, a useful gauge to the country. Based on these results, what should we provide?"

That hundreds of men and women worked to damn the Wasteland.\n\nThey'd smashed the holodisks and burned the records. They'd killed any NCR officials who knew the original story at Camp Turtledove. But it was true, wasn't it? Had the Chosen One failed, Granite and an entire generation of the Enclave would not be alive today. Their mothers or fathers would have died drowning in their own fluids at the hand of a president none of them ever met. The entire cause they'd fought for? They were worse than Caesar, worse than the Brotherhood. And they ruled the Wasteland.\n\nThe only democracy in the West, snuffed out like a flame. An order that survived since the Great War? Buried in their bunkers. Even the cause, brutal though it was, that brought order to Arizona? Crucified on the roads they'd built.\n\nAfter a moment, Granite signalled to the pilot. A bright young kid, he knew. Raised in Navarro itself, a mother from Redding. Perhaps his generation would do a better job."

The mutagenic serum was designed to cause a regression in the genetic matrix that results in the destabilization and assimilation of abberant DNA, leaving the host free of mutagenic potential.\n\nSadly, at the moment the cure leads to rapid cellular apoptosis and, regrettably, does not stabilze their mitochrondrial nuclei. But I'm sure we can always find more subjects - and as we always knew, rebuilding America - that takes time, even for the Enclave."

Enter Max Sec, which took convicts from across the Wates for a reasonable price. produced from Max Sec can range from rare minerals to rewired circuitry, but largely fall under the general guise of crafted metal components. These materials are then exported to various nations, turning Max Sec a healthy profit.\n\nNew Management, however, proposes new uses for the prisoners. The Portmasters prefer to stick with the tried and true. The Hubologists have noted that the empty sky up here in the mountains offers a chance to gaze upon the heavens, turning this into a pilgrimage for their god. And Granite Company? Well, they've got some ideas from an old, pre-war place.\n\n                                                Camp Turtledove. "
