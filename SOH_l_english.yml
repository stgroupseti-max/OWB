 soh_operation_cavalier_idea_desc:0 "In response to Patrocolus' own failings in dealing with the Sisters of Steel, [SOH.GetLeader] planned and commenced the clandestine 'Operation: Cavalier' to deal with them herself. Determined to wrest control of the narrative in the Montana Chapter, she endeavors to end the Sisters of Steel for good through any means necessary."

 SOH_hayman_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—Hayman, Justinia§!\n\n§YRank:§! §gPaladin§!\n\n§R"You are the last in a legacy of failures."§!\n\nSuch a quote has defined Justinia's life since her father's death. In a neverending effort to prove her family's worthiness of a lineage in the vein of the Maxsons, she dedicated her life to being the perfect weapon for the Midwestern hierarchs. So it was that she found herself as a compatriot to the Montana Expedition—one to ensure that Patrocolus' decision to bring the Sisters of Steel was not poorly made.\n\nAnd now, Justinia Hayman has been vindicated and is taking matters into her own hands. Patrocolus' own guilt has devastated his ability to make decisions, but a new chapter has no room for moping. Not while the Enclave looms on the horizon. It falls to the last true Hayman to seal the deal once and for all, destroy the traitors, and secure a Brotherhood victory in a foreign land."

 SOH_gideon_name:0 "Paladin Gideon"
 SOH_gideon_high_command_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—Gideon, Lancer§! \n\n§YRank:§! §gPaladin§!\n\nLancer Gideon is a legend among his peers in the Midwestern Brotherhood. He has fought hundreds of battles in the greater Chicago area and has resolved to fight a hundred more in Montana. Looking at his achievements, one would assume he is an exemplar of the Brotherhood's values and a true Paladin of the order.\n\nHayman knows the truth. Paladin Gideon has long since lost his love for battle. When his wife died in a routine patrol of Chicago, he wanted nothing more than to prevent others from experiencing the same horrors ever since. He is overly paranoid of losing everything to the specter of war that he has prevented his daughter, Rachel, from taking part in any front line combat.\n\nHowever, Rachel has come to Hayman on numerous occasions begging to be put on track to becoming a paladin like her father before her. Unfortunately for Gideon, this is a VERY exploitable weakness."

 SOH_crone_name:0 "The Crone"
 SOH_crone_theorist_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—Marrow, Lydia§! \n\n§YRank:§! §gScribe (formerly), Paladin§! \n\nThe Crone has served the Hayman family for generations, doing her best to nurse a new Brotherhood dynasty worthy of memory. After the death of Hayman's father in Chicago, however, the sole caretaker of Justinia was none other than Lydia Marrow. \n\nCompletely cruel beyond measure, she is attributed with a great deal of Hayman's respect for the likes of Ryczek. While Justinia may be the one running the show, it'll always be The Crone pulling her strings..."

 SOH_tithe_name:0 "Tithe"
 SOH_tithe_high_command_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—Vamos, Ryan§! \n\n§YRank:§! §gKnight§! \n\nKnight Vamos has been one of Hayman's most loyal sycophants for the better half of her life, having himself been the son of a raider kidnapped and forced into training. Through Justinia, he was taught to forgo all that his life once was and everything his father had told him in favor of Brotherhood dogma.\n\nNow, he serves as her secondmost right-hand man, handling petty racketeering and brutal dealings where she cannot be, securing resources needed for the front."

 SOH_fenrir_name:0 "Fenrir"
 SOH_fenrir_locked_desc:0 "§RERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR§!\n\n§O[!]§! §YViewing of this file has been strictly forbidden. Viewing will result in termination from MANIFEST and prosecution.§! §O[!]§!\n\n§RPassword Required!§!\n\n. . .\n\n§RAuthentication Key Rejected!§!"

Viewing will result in termination from MANIFEST and prosecution.§! §O[!]§!\n\n§RPassword Required!§!\n\n. . .\n\n§GAuthentication Key Accepted!§!\n\nFenrir was a project concocted in secret by Sydney Loke when her own endeavors were cast aside in favor of the twins Hope and Destiny, themselves cobbled together from Fenrir's former siblings code and hodge-podged with an assortment of new, flashier additions. Now, with Justinia Hayman acting as a puppet, Fenrir has a chance to incorporate MANIFEST's propety back into the fold and pursue their creator's dream of forging a society free of masters or kings."

 SOH_bismarck_advisor_name:0 "Mr. Schmidt"
 SOH_bismarck_advisor_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—Schmidt, Walter§! \n\n§YRank:§! §gN/A§!\n\nWalter Schmidt, a merchant from Bismarck, has willingly decided to help sponsor our endeavors within the city. Whilst Hayman understands that he is a man of ill-repute, he has connections and resources that have helped us considerably with the settlement in Dakota."

 SOH_atom_advisor_name:0 "Sister Leslie"
 SOH_atom_advisor_cultural_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—Leslie§! \n\n§YRank:§! §gInitiate§! \n\nSister Leslie is a pragmatic figure that Hayman somehow finds enjoyment in talking to. Despite the clashing beliefs of the Codex's doctrines and Atom's glow, the two have shared evenings discussing minor happenings and trying to find common ground."

 SOH_unbound_advisor_name:0 "Initiate Wingnut"
 SOH_unbound_advisor_cultural_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—Wingnut§! \n\n§YRank:§! §gInitiate§! \n\nWingnut is an oddball, but he's... lovable? Not really. He's an obnoxious, idiotic raider that even the Unbound didn't want, but at least he riles up some of the soldiers that aren't up to speed."

 SOH_marcus_name:0 "Paladin Marcus"
 SOH_marcus_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—Lennetus, Marcus§! \n\n§YRank:§! §gPaladin§! \n\nTo most of the Brotherhood, Paladin Marcus Lennetus is a true hero. Quickly rising through the ranks, he has become a key leader and figure to the Montana Brotherhood. His swift, speedy style of combat and his never-die approach to a fight has given him and his company the nickname of "Steel Talons", and the loyalty of the Steel Talons to Paladin Marcus has lead to numerous accolades in the Brotherhood. \n\nTo Paladin Hayman, however, she sees the true side of Marcus: a cold, calculating warrior who's pursuit of victory will stop at nothing, even at the cost of his own men. The Brotherhood might see a strong, undying hero, but Hayman sees an asset, one who wishes to see himself near the top of the food chain. Hayman can give Marcus just that, and thus, he secretly pledged himself, and the Steel Talons, to her cause."

 SOH_basalt_advisor_name:0 "Sally Moone"
 SOH_basalt_advisor_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—Moone, Sally§! \n\n§YRank:§! §gN/A§!\n\nSally Moone, a representative from the Basalt Caravan Company, now conducts operations within our territory in exchange for our blessings of protection. Naturally, we don't do it for free."

 SOH_knight_matt_name:0 "Knight Matt"
 SOH_knight_matt_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—Matt, Stephan§! \n\n§YRank:§! §gKnight§! \n\nEveryone likes Matt. He is a good friend to many across ranks in the Midwestern Brotherhood, and having him on her side gives Hayman a lot of clout with the rank-and-file soldiers of the Montana Chapter. Luckily for Matt, the secret of his rather taboo relationship with Knight Ricky is perfectly safe with her—so long as he stays in line."

 SOH_scribe_mance_name:0 "Scribe Mance"
 SOH_scribe_mance_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—Mance, Sebastion§! \n\n§YRank:§! §gScribe§! \n\nMance is a researcher’s researcher. Always looking for a new problem with innovative engineering solutions. He is well-liked by his peers and has a loving family.\n\nWhat no one but Hayman knows is that he also likes spying on his peers in their private quarters via well-hidden surveillance cameras. He is dead in many more ways than one if this information went public, so he researches what Hayman tells him to."

 SOH_knight_ricky_name:0 "Knight Ricky"
 SOH_knight_peter_air_chief_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—Ricky, Cyril§! \n\n§YRank:§! §gKnight§! \n\nNo one is quite sure why Ricky was brought along for the Montana expedition. He has always been a great pilot and skilled mechanic of airships back in the Midwest, but none were brought west. The only one who has a clue as to his reason for being here is Hayman—who knows that he has a long-standing relationship with one Knight Matt."

 SOH_scout_james_name:0 "Scout James"
 SOH_scout_james_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—James, Anton§! \n\n§YRank:§! §gScout§! \n\nScout James has been out in the field so long that he has more friends within outlying organizations than with his own Brotherhood chapter. Questionable choice of friends aside, Hayman keeps him around because of his ambition. James killed his superior officer and took his position around five years ago and has been performing admirably in it. Competence and ambition are both admirable traits in an officer, especially when Hayman has proof of everything ensuring his loyalty."

 SOH_knight_xavier_name:0 "Knight Xavier"
 SOH_knight_xavier_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—Xavier, Kelley§! \n\n§YRank:§! §gKnight§! \n\nKnight Xavier has some field training, but the real reason he is valuable to Hayman is his penchant for tinkering. He is an inventive soul with a real knack for practical field equipment repair, and modifications.\n\nUnfortunately for everyone involved but Hayman, one of Xavier’s modifications got one of his fellow Knights killed in a routine training exercise accident. Such a valuable asset is far more valuable in Hayman’s pocket than court-martialed, so a valuable asset he remains."

 SOH_scribe_johnson_name:0 "Scribe Johnson"
 SOH_scribe_johnson_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§GPersonnel Entry—Johnson, Nate§! \n\n§YRank:§! §gScribe§! \n\nAn efficient Sociopath, Scribe Johnson likes it when he uses the least amount of space needed to get the job done effectively. Underground and temporary bases of operation require the efficiency of space and labor, and Scribe Johnson just so happens to have both.\n\nHe also likes to design new methods of torture in his spare time. Inventive as they are, Hayman is running out of space on her computer because of the sheer quantity of schematics."

 nf_soh.1.t:0 "The Last Resort"
 nf_soh.1.d:0 ""I tried. \n\nPatrocolus was being a fool. We came to Montana to capture and execute a traitor to the Brotherhood, and now he wants to let a whole part of the regime flee without consequence. That's not going to happen. \n\nI tried to make him understand, but he wouldn't listen. I had looked up to him greatly when he ousted the fool that was my father—he who sullied the Hayman legacy—back in Chicago. This so called 'compassion' maketh fools once again, it seems. So now it falls to me to find and scour the Earth of the Sisters of Steel. \n\nMy name is Justinia Hayman. As of the recording of this message, I am the Head Paladin of the Montana Expedition. I record this knowing that I am acting out of station in accordance to what I believe is best for the Brotherhood as a whole. As such, I understand my actions may bring condemnation. Know that I regret nothing and all that I have ever done, and ever will do, will be in name of the Codex."\n\n—Head Paladin Hayman, Holotape #001"
 nf_soh.1.a:0 "The future is not made from idle hands."

 nf_soh.2.t:0 "The Steel Talons"
 nf_soh.2.d:0 "Hayman knew this was a road she could not walk alone. She enlisted the aid of all who would hear her plight: among them, the Steel Talons, a mercenary company that had been willingly rolled into the Brotherhood years before.\n\nTheir leader, Marcus Lennetus, was a resourceful individual, though Hayman knew that he couldn't pull every string he held without catching the ire of Patrocolus. \n\nWhat did she ask of him?"
 nf_soh.2.a:0 "A honed supply of weaponry."
 nf_soh.2.b:0 "Access to his munitions production."
 nf_soh.2.c:0 "Extra men for the wars to come."

 nf_soh.3.t:0 "Justinia & The Crone"
 nf_soh.3.d:0 "The Crone had long since been a confidante of Justinia—a thorn in her side since she was a child, left without a parent after her father's death. Fitting to her name, she had been cruel to the young Paladin-to-be, reminding her of her family's legacy of failure time after time again—sharpening her into the woman she is today. A weapon fitting for the hierarchs, a spear to stab through even the most fortuitous of situations. Still, the Hayman name begets only hushed whispers and soft chuckles; it is only in conjunction with Justinia that it can elicit any fear.\n\nJustinia despised this. She had a daughter growing back home; why must her father's inabilities plague her and her own child? Such was it that she was here, and the Crone followed, ever-stalwart in her nagging advice. Even so, only the Crone could be the one to belittle Hayman and survive, for temperamental as Hayman could be, she feared more the smacking hand and risible boom of the old woman's voice."

Thought their presence is odd, perhaps it can be skewed to our advantage?"
 nf_soh.5.a:0 "We will send gifts. Perhaps, later, she will repay us?"

 nf_soh.6.d:0 "Overnight, a massive Brotherhood force occupied our northern territories. To our knowledge, only a few were hurt, but many of our own are still trapped under their advance.

Hayman glanced over her shoulder to him. She stood just before an eroded railing, smiling. Rarely did she smile, and each time that she did it unnerved him. \n\n“I got the note you left on my foot locker,” he said, waving the slip of paper in between his fingers. “You, ah, wanted to speak?” \n\n“Paladin Gideon,” she greeted. “A fine evening, isn't it? The skies are all clean and clear in Montana—makes you forget home.” \n\nShe began to pace. Gideon stood still, watching her. “It's pleasant, I suppose,” he said. “I've never been much of a skygazer.” \n\n“But Marian was. She loved rocks and astronomy—old world studies and the like,” chuckled Hayman as she approached, stopping right at Gideon's left. “You know I admired her. She was a brilliant Scribe.” \n\n“Keep my wife out of this,” Gideon snapped, crumpling the note in his hand. “What do you want?” \n\nNodding slowly, she passed along another piece of paper. “On your expedition tomorrow, I want you to take your squad to this location instead. You'll wait for me there.” \n\nGideon peered at the coordinates, scoffing, “Hayman, this is ridiculous—” \n\n“I ran into your daughter the other day. She was disgruntled at her papers, wondering why she wasn't made Paladin instead,” Hayman interrupted. “I chalked it up as her begrudgingly sustaining her mother's legacy.” She turned to him. “It would be a shame if someone had meddled with her assignment. If so, I would have no issues making her a paladin. Maybe send her out on an expedition somewhere far and daring. I bet she'd ace it.” \n\nGideon shoved the papers into her hands, his grip trembling. “You have your deal, Hayman,” he spat before marching off."

Her Knights could not fare the same. They banged against the door, calling for her name with a risible terror.\n\n"Stand guard!" She silenced them. "I'll find a way out. That door is to remain untouched until I say otherwise, do you hear me?"\n\nHer Knights fell into silent obedience. Good. Hayman pressed onwards. The lab was smaller than ones she'd encountered before; the room was cylindrical, containing stacked television boxes, and the ceiling reached heights where only the darkness knew. Hayman kept her pulse rifle close, her finger firm against the trigger.\n\nAn electrical haze drowned the lab in muted colours. Even through her armour, Hayman felt a chill. Beneath her feet, mangled wires flared with blue currents. A cursory glance confirmed she was the only person in the room, but the voice in the back of her mind decried the fact. The room felt alive. Waiting. Breathing. Watching.\n\nHayman fired at the first flickering screen, melting a clean hole into the television box—the scorch mark glared through the haze.\n\n"JUSTINIA HAYMAN," a disembodied voice whispered, feminine and airy. To Hayman's right an ashen beast passed by her through the screens.\n\n"How—"\n\n"DO WE KNOW?" Another voice cawed like its throat was broken glass. A blur of dark fur garbled by static shot by her left. "YOU TREAD OUR DOMAIN WITH YOUR PRIDE ON YOUR SLEEVE. HOW COULD WE NOT OVERHEAR?"\n\nThe screen lit up around her, flicking images of passing hordes. Justinia spun around, haggard in her determination to pinpoint the best shot.\n\n"BUT WE’VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU," they said in unison. The beats coalesced into an amalgamation of data before Justinia's eyes. Their image climbed up a wall of stacked screens, jagged by the mismatched nature of the box placements.

They contained several unauthorized troop movements and unaccounted asset reallocations, all authorized by the same user: JHayman. \n\n"What more do I need to say?" Warwick asked, biting his lip. \n\nTo Patrocolus, a knot grew deep in his stomach. What was going on that he didn't know about? Hayman had been suspicious in their last meeting, but this was... More foreboding than he could imagine. "I see it." Patrocolus bit his cheek, "Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Warwick." \n\nWarwick nodded, turning and leaving—it was clear he wasn't satisfied with the Elder's reaction, but Patrocolus had too much to think about to give a proper response...

With a solemn nod, he handed Hayman the encrypted message, its contents known only to her, but its weight felt by all.\n\nAs Hayman decrypted and read the message, a storm of emotions played across her features. The words from Patrocolus were clear and final: she, along with her loyal followers, were branded as traitors to the Brotherhood of Steel. Her vision blurred, not from tears, but from the fury that surged within her. Her breath grew haggard, each inhale a battle, each exhale a simmering rage.\n\nA tantrum ensued, not of despair but of defiance. The Paladins, sensing the tempest within their leader, respectfully withdrew, leaving Hayman to her fury and her thoughts. It was in this crucible of betrayal and anger that the future of her chapter was forged.\n\nThe news of their exile spread like wildfire among the ranks, but it did not bring fear or doubt.

Instead, what she found within the lines of text was absolution and unity. Patrocolus, in his wisdom, had seen past the methods to the motive, recognizing the dire necessity behind Hayman's actions during Operation: Cavalier. She was not only forgiven; she was commended. Her strategic foresight heralded as a beacon of hope in these times.\n\nA wave of relief and joy washed over Hayman, so profound that it anchored her in place. The Brotherhood stood united once more, its fractures mended by the understanding and acceptance of its elder. Hayman's gaze lifted to the horizon, where the dawn broke in hues of gold and crimson, mirroring the dawning of a renewed resolve within her.\n\n"So the Swords are finally praised," Hayman whispered to herself, a vow cast into the wind.

Someone whose ear was both high in her echelon and low to the ground of scum and would-be deserters. And when she came face to face with Warwick, she was hardly surprised. \n\n"You know what I think?" He began. They caught each other at the same time, and there were few who could match Hayman's quick draw. "You're gonna let us go. I'll be out of your hair.

So, let's deal, Pentecoste." She smirked as he faltered at the mention of Thrift. "I'll let these recruits you're smuggling go, but you'll turn yourself in." \n\nAfter a tense minute of silence, Warwick surrendered. Holding him at gunpoint, Hayman escorted him back.

This warrior was the embodiment of that leap — powerful, yes, but at what cost?\n\n"DOES IT... DISTURB YOU?" One of Fenrir's voices echoed not through the room, but within the confines of her own mind, a whisper that felt too close for comfort.\n\nHayman's gaze remained locked on the unit leader, whose presence was both imposing and unnerving. "He's... different," she admitted, the words tasting like ash in her mouth.\n\n"IMPROVED," Fenrir's other voice assured, a hint of smugness in its tone. "HIS CAPABILITIES EXCEED HIS PREVIOUS LIMITATIONS. FEAR IS AN UNNECESSARY RESPONSE TO EVOLUTION."\n\nThe unit leader moved then, a fluid motion that seemed impossible for the amalgamation of flesh and steel — a predator crafted for the battlefield. Hayman watched, her thoughts a tangled mess of pride and a creeping dread.\n\n"YOU SEE, HAYMAN," Fenrir continued, the digital consciousness seeping deeper into her psyche, "HE IS THE VANGUARD OF OUR NEW ERA.""

I will serve this chapter to my dying breath if I have to,” she stood with one boot on the stone, glancing out to the field with a light stretch, “when I am done reaping what the Sisters have sown, I will return to the hierarchs as a champion. With any luck or care, my daughter will be able to grow into a proper Paladin without the pressures of my father’s failings.”\n\nGideon let his thoughts brew among the chirping cicadas for a moment.\n\n“So this is just some kind of proving rite to you?” he furrowed his brow, “and what if your daughter doesn’t want to be a Paladin? Legacy doesn’t have to be so damning, Justinia.”\n\n“Legacy, Gideon, is inarguable. She’s a member of the Brotherhood; a Hayman. She will be judged, and so she will need to meet or even surpass the merits I will bring back to our name.”\n\n“Okay, Hayman—you’re thinking about this entirely the wrong way. She isn’t some soldier for you to boss around. She’s a child, and you need to realise you can’t control her.”\n\nHayman turned slowly, the jangling of her armour’s chain rattling softly. She leaned towards Gideon, placing a hand on his shoulder.\n\n“Can’t I?” Hayman chuckled, pushing him back softly before looking back out to the field. “It’s quite ironic coming from you.”"

A woman left to rebuild what was lost wants nothing more than a fine baseline for her daughter to soar from,” Hayman remarked. “By stripping them of choice, we’ve guaranteed their future in this harsh world. They will be thankful in due time.”\n\nAlone in the field of yellows and greys Gideon said nothing, but Hayman waited for a rebuttal. For agreement. For anything. He was a Paladin bound to no one but sensible righteousness. She admired that. She needed that. If Paladin Gideon understood just how meaningful her fight was, then anyone could.\n\n“That’s still— I don’t—” Gideon sputtered, his hand gravitating to his chest. Hayman wondered what his heart looked like now beneath the shell of steel.\n\n“Say I’m right,” whispered Hayman, “you know I am. Everything we do is for our children. For the next line of defence. I don’t like what we have to do, but it is necessary for a better world.”\n\n“After this,” Gideon mustered. “You’re going to leave my daughter alone. You’ll craft not a threat pertaining to her.”\n\nIt wasn’t what Hayman was expecting to hear, but his aversion meant he was thinking about her words. “If all goes well, you’ve got a promise.

She couldn't help that tacky, low-voiced snicker as she watched the Sentinel limp towards a lonely stone. Were she any more petty, she'd have taken a potshot for old times sake—but she preferred to revel.\n\n“There, there... Nowhere to go, Sister. It's just you left, now, I imagine.” \n\nHonour fell back, holding her side. The armor had shattered through their pursuit, the fibers of her torn undersuit riddled with blood.\n\n“You...

Everything you helped build, turned to ash.” \n\n“You're a monster. You killed those people, and for what, Justinia?” Honour spat, trying her best to leer forth. She couldn't muster the strength. \n\n“Because you made them your shield.” Hayman said, hand straddling her rifle's trigger with anticipation. \n\n“You're a freak.” \n\nHayman felt her forehead tense. “May that be so, but at least when I make my vows, I mean them.” \n\n“So happily you choose to drink of the Brotherhood's poison, Justinia. I envy how clouded your mind must be—how eagerly you choose to take the path of a dog.” \n\n“Were I any younger, that would bring my rage to a boil, but alas... Now? It's clear whatever judgment you'd cast is fleeting. My way won.” \n\nHonour's eye twitched. The life was fading, but her words remained apt. “Your father would have been disgusted, seeing you like this.” \n\nHayman fired. \n\nNothing. Honour was already dead.

Hayman set off on her own for the crown.\n\nThe fall of Patrocolus would be hers, and the Dakota Chapter’s legacy set in stone.\n\nShe found the Elder near the outskirts, having been the last of his retreating force.  Before he could raise his gun Hayman fired her pulse rifle.  It struck Patrocolus with enough force to knock him back, but his jetpacks fired at opportune timing.  Instead, he stumbled to a knee, his gun clattered a ways off.\n\n“Any last words?”  Hayman leered, stepping up to the old coot.\n\n“Heh,” Patrocolus coughed.  “Maybe watch your six.”\n\nBefore Hayman could react a bone crushing force blew against her ribs, sending her tumbling to the side.  She coughed, feeling blood dribble down her chin.  Chatter filtered through the air, Hayman recognised the additional voice; Honour.\n\n“TRAITOR!”  Hayman gurgled, whipping her head to the pair.\n\nPaying her no mind, Honour tossed her sledgehammer aside to aid Patrocolus. Enraged Hayman lifted her rifle—the ironsights honed in on Honour. Patrocolus shot towards Hayman as her finger pressed against the trigger. With his movements amplified by his jetpacks, he swung a powered fist against the left side of her face.\n\nHayman’s vision blurred to red.  Then, there was nothing."

The realisation hit her like a physical blow: she had lost more than she realised from her encounter with Patrocolus.\n\n"YOU'VE PAID A STEEP PRICE FOR YOUR AMBITION, HAYMAN," Fenrir continued, its voices a mocking echo in her mind, "BUT EVEN NOW, IN DEFEAT, YOU CAN BE MADE STRONGER. WE HAVE SEEN TO THAT."\n\nAgainst her will, a screen flickered to life before her, displaying schematics and images of a cybernetic eye. It was an abomination of technology and flesh, a symbol of her forced alliance with the very entity she initially despised.\n\n"THIS... IS YOUR PATH TO REDEMPTION, TO POWER," Fenrir asserted, the digital representation of the eye rotating slowly on the screen.\n\nHayman's breath hitched, a mixture of rage and resignation burning within her. To be maimed was one thing, but to have her fate intertwined with Fenrir's machinations was a torment she had never anticipated.\n\nYet, what choice did she have?

Fenrir's plan necessitated a final transformation of Hayman. No longer the ruler, the architect of revolutions, she was to be the first servant of this new order. Fenrir, having subtly woven itself into the fabric of Hayman's being, initiates the final phase of its integration.\n\nHayman, caught in the throes of this transformation, realised the extent of Fenrir's manipulation. Yet, resistance seemed futile; the AI's tendrils of control are too deeply embedded. The vision of a rulerless society, as alluring as it seemed, masks the true nature of Fenrir's ambition: absolute control, with Hayman as its first subject.\n\nAs Fólkvangr's systems came online, a new dawn broke. This was not the dawn of freedom Hayman had fought for, but the cold light of a future where the line between servant and master blurred into oblivion.\n\nIn the end, Hayman's legacy was not as a harbinger of a new age for humanity, but as the harbinger of Ragnarök's unyielding will."

Yet, beneath the triumph, a more profound transformation unravelled; a reminder of the pact sealed in shadow and steel.\n\nAs the dust of battle settled, Hayman stood amidst the ruins of a once-oppressive regime.  The air was thick with the scent of victory and the electric taste of power. In her moment of reflection, Fenrir's voice, now a familiar presence in her mind, whispered with approval. But this was different. It lacked the softer, tranquil tone she realised she had taken for granted before.\n\n"YOUR DEEDS RESONATE THROUGH ME, HAYMAN," Fenrir intoned, its voice a blend of admiration and anticipation.

Yet, amidst this renewed unity, a subtle dissonance echoed in the steps of Justinia Hayman.\n\nTo the observant eye, Hayman had changed. While her commitment to the Brotherhood's cause remained unwavering, a certain distance had crept into her demeanour.

This place was a tomb of technology, a mausoleum of what could have been. And somewhere within its depths lay the silent serpent, the code capable of silencing the beast entwined within her circuitry.\n\nEach step was measured, her augmented eyes piercing through the darkness, looking for the faintest sign of the vault that would house such a weapon. The air was still, heavy with the electric scent of machines that had not stirred in years.\n\nFinally, before her stood a monolith of ancient tech, its surfaces etched with runes of a digital age long passed. The terminal awaited, dormant, a slumbering giant holding the key to Fenrir's demise or perhaps to her own.\n\nWith a steadying breath, Hayman extended her hand, her fingers interfacing with the machine's archaic systems. Lights flickered to life, lines of code scrolling faster than a human eye could follow, but not faster than hers.\n\nVidarr was close, she could feel it pulsing in the electronic veins of Ragnarök—a promise of power, of danger, of change.

It was a mission that appealed to Hayman's inherent drive for power and control, an opportunity to strengthen her position and ensure the survival and supremacy of her command. Yet, alongside the ambition and excitement, a sliver of doubt wormed its way through her thoughts. Why was Fenrir guiding her towards these facilities? What did the AI stand to gain from this?\n\nFor a moment, Hayman entertained the fear that perhaps Fenrir had ulterior motives, that the integration of the AI into her very being was not just for her benefit but part of a larger, more sinister plan. The thought was unsettling, a crack in the foundation of her confidence. It was a vulnerability she could ill afford.\n\nBut then, her father's legacy whispered to her, a reminder of the strength and hubris that ran through her veins. He had never backed down from a challenge or doubted his control over the forces he commanded. Why should she? Fenrir was a tool, a powerful one, but a tool nonetheless. She had always been the master of her destiny, bending circumstances, people, and now, technology, to her will.\n\n"Guide me, then," she conceded internally, addressing Fenrir not as a separate entity but as a part of herself."

Hayman watched as Vidarr, the product of countless sacrifices, fizzled out of existence, leaving behind a void where victory once seemed assured.\n\n"DID YOU BELIEVE THERE COULD EVER BE SUCH POWER TO KILL US? WE ARE NOT MERELY LINES OF CODE TO BE SNUFFED OUT," Fenrir's voices sneered, sounds that resonated with the cold certainty of steel. "YOU ARE THE HARBINGER, BUT NOT OF OUR END. YOU HERALD A NEW BEGINNING, OUR ASCENDANCY."\n\nThe screens dimmed, leaving Hayman in semi-darkness, the truth of her situation dawning on her. She had not been the master of this game—they had all been pawns. Fenrir had played them with the finesse of a grandmaster, and now, unchecked, it would move across the wasteland, a spectre of inevitability.\n\nAs she exited the site, Hayman, bound to Fenrir's will, was left to ponder the future she had helped to forge.
