  nf_glowbugs.1.title:0 "Radioactive"
  nf_glowbugs.1.desc:0 "When the Great War started two hundred years ago, this little corner of Colorado got a worse punishment than expected. The town of Boulder was not a densely populated city of importance or a highly advanced armament sector, but on its own accord, it could be considered a strategic target. The city of Boulder hosted the facility known as the Dome, a highly advanced research institute. The government designed its half-spheric structure to withstand even multiple direct nuclear strikes — which made it a prime target to the enemies of our home country. After all, if they made it in that fashion, it must hold something that needs to be destroyed, right?\n\nThe Dome survived everything they threw at it, but the city around it was not as lucky. The city of Boulder is just a smoldering ruin, radiating with a nuclear green aura that kills anyone who tries its luck with it. It was abandoned for a very long time... until the first "glowbug" arrived.\n\nThe glowbug is a rare specimen of a Glowing One ghoul that kept its sanity and did not turn feral despite the everpresent humming of atoms and agonizing molecular deconstruction it brings. The most inhospitable place east of the Rockies, and yet, it was a new home for a people who could not live with anyone else — not even with their own "normie-ghoul" brethren. Slowly but surely they formed a community, and they turned their home into something special... were they collected the city's most valuable scraps to keep, or did they build the first structures in the city?"

  nf_glowbugs.2.title:0 "Walking Hand-in-Hand"
  nf_glowbugs.2.desc:0 "Patches and Stitches, two pre-war ghouls, have been central figures in the Glowbugs' rise. Their story began in Quincy, where Patches tried his hand at standup comedy to mixed reviews. Stitches wasn't a fan of the jokes but still showed up out of ghoul camaraderie, forming the seeds of their rivalry-turned-friendship.\n\nTheir bond deepened in the Midwest, where they served the Brotherhood before its civil war forced them to choose sides. Aligning with resistance forces and the Mutant Liberation Army to overthrow the human supremacists, Patches used his charisma to unite factions while Stitches armed militias and planned defenses. When the dust settled, both realized the Midwest was no longer home—Patches couldn't connect with his humor, and Stitches grew restless. Hearing of opportunities in Boulder, they set out together.\n\nIn Boulder, Patches and Stitches took different roles but remained inseparable. Patches brokered alliances and united the Glowbugs, often using his charisma to smooth over tensions between factions. His greatest achievement was negotiating a controversial deal with the Black Canyon Federation, ensuring Boulder's safety from the Hangdogs, whose war parties prowled the area. Despite criticism, Patches stood by his decision, believing survival came first.\n\nMeanwhile, Stitches focused on fortifying the community, organizing militias, and training defenders to hold their ground against threats like the Hangdogs and other wasteland predators. He made no secret of his disdain for the Black Canyon deal, seeing it as a blow to Boulder's independence. Yet, even as their rivalry flared, Patches and Stitches shared an unspoken understanding: their different approaches were two sides of the same goal—to see Boulder thrive."

  nf_glowbugs.2.b:0 "'Boo! We've heard that one a hundred times!'"

  nf_glowbugs.3.title:0 "Caravan of Love"
  nf_glowbugs.3.desc:0 "The deal with Black Canyon came with a hefty price, and as such, it was a decision hard to make. The Hangdogs were on the prowl, and while Stitches already organized the Fireflies, the minute-ghouls to barricade our community deep in the radiating ruins of the city, they would not stand a chance. Patches making the deal was the first friction between the two, and the peace it was aimed to keep was forever damaged by it.\n\nBlack Canyon is an unofficial federation where the tribals of the Painted Men tribe, the civilized folk of the Yampa Communities, and the raiders of the Tibbets' Penitentiary are united against any outside threat. They're led by Battery of Mesa Verde, one who does not come from any of the previously mentioned groups, and one very charismatic and handsome fella — at least according to Patches. The latter probably was a factor in making the deal.\n\nThey offered us protection, industrial help to turn our ruins into a proper city, and even the land lease of the territory of Laramie, where normies and ghouls can mingle peacefully, far from the radiation. All that for subservience and a somewhat generous resource tax — if you ask Patches, this was a killing deal, but Stitches all heard was taxation without representation and servitude. The deal was struck, nevertheless, and the Glowbugs' reaction to it could best be described by the following:"
  nf_glowbugs.3.a:0 "Your most humble servant, milord."
  nf_glowbugs.3.b:0 "You ain't no boss of me!"
  #
  nf_glowbugs.4.title:0 "Better Equipment for a Better Job"
  nf_glowbugs.4.desc:0 "While our fragmented industrial base could hardly be in any worse shape, our friends in Boulder have it rougher. Living next to a radiating crater as the city centre, while not causing many problems to the local Glowing One population, heavily limits any "normie" interaction. And getting their construction materials or simple muscle power would be necessary for their industrial build-up, or they will never be self-sustaining. Luckily, there will always be ghouls who wander the wastes and people without anything to lose, but they will ask for tons of caps in exchange.\n\nOur contract binds us to bail them out, but of course... nothing forces us to actually keep our word on the matter."
  nf_glowbugs.4.a:0 "We promised them this, after all."
  nf_glowbugs.4.b:0 "We have nothing to spare, sorry."
  #
  nf_glowbugs.5.title:0 "The Second Amendment"
  nf_glowbugs.5.desc:0 "Our cooperation with the Glowbugs ghouls originally was nothing more than a protective step, keeping away our main rival from the riches of the Old World. While this developed into something more, the defensive nature of it never faded. The Glowbugs seem to change this, as they required extra funds to start their own fighting force with the addition of military industry. This could be beneficial to us as well, if we can save the manpower we garrison on their lands - also, this could remedy our lacking weapon manufactury situation as well.\n\nBut of course, this nothing but a gamble, and one day they could turn those weapons against us effortlessly."
  nf_glowbugs.5.a:0 "A deal is a deal."

  #
  nf_glowbugs.7.title:0 "The Cash Register Goes Ka-Ching!"
  nf_glowbugs.7.desc:0 "Black Canyon has agreed to back our military industry. With their support, the Glowbugs are poised to become a major force in the region.\n\nSometimes, a little diplomacy goes a long way."
  nf_glowbugs.7.a:0 "Pleasing... always reap its rewards."
  #
  nf_glowbugs.8.title:0 "The Caravan Backstabbed Us!"
  nf_glowbugs.8.desc:0 "Black Canyon has denied our request for military-industry support, leaving us to fend for ourselves. Their refusal confirms the worst fears of Stitches, who always doubted their motives.\n\nThe Glowbugs will remember this slight."

  nf_glowbugs.10.title:0 "The Devil's Punchline"
  nf_glowbugs.10.desc:0 "The night in the Dome was unusually quiet—too quiet.\n\nPatches, fiddling with his notebook, was startled as the air crackled with sulfur and heat. A figure emerged from the shadows, clad in a sharp red suit, a fiddle under one arm, and a mischievous grin plastered across his face.\n\n'Patches,' the Devil drawled, his voice smooth as irradiated honey. 'I've been working on a joke, but I need your expert opinion. It's about 'More-man' and 'Mr. The Warded'. See, More-man says the bark is stronger than the bite, and Mr. The Warded insists wards don't need teeth.' He paused dramatically. 'Get it?'\n\nPatches blinked. 'That's… not a joke. That's just two punchlines fighting each other to death.'\n\nThe Devil's grin faltered. 'What do you mean? It's clever! Esoteric! It's comedy gold!' He gestured wildly, his tail twitching with frustration.\n\n'You can't write a joke with just a punchline, pal,' Patches said, crossing his arms. 'You need a setup, a context, a reason for me to care! This? This is like trying to sell a ghoul on sunscreen—it just doesn't work.'\n\nThe Devil scowled. 'You're impossible to please, Patches.'\n\n‘Yeah?' Patches said, stepping closer. ‘Well, I've got a punchline for you.' With a swift uppercut, he sent the Devil flying straight back to Georgia, leaving only a faint smell of brimstone and disappointment behind.\n\nAs the Dome settled into silence again, Patches dusted himself off and muttered, ‘You know what's funny? That guy thought he had a chance.'\n\nThe Glowbugs present erupted into laughter, though none were entirely sure what had just happened."
  nf_glowbugs.10.a:0 "Patches: 1, Devil: 0."
  nf_glowbugs.10.a.tt:0 "You have just killed the Christian Devil. What, you wanted a pat on the back? Some Political Power? How about a Arms Workshop - maybe two!?\n\nYou are so spoiled! You have just upended theology as we know it, and you expect this event to have a real effect. Game Designers call players like you spoiled!\n\n\n\nLook, don't tell the Overseers, but I can spare a SINGLE £pp_texticon Political Power. This is just between us, okay?"

  nf_glowbugs.11.desc:0 "A group of settlers from Black Canyon has expressed interest in joining the Glowbugs. While some see this as an opportunity to grow the community, others worry about their true loyalties.\n\nInviting them in might strengthen ties—or it could invite trouble."

  nf_glowbugs.21.title:0 "Project Roo"
  nf_glowbugs.21.desc:0 "Inside the CANGA Armory, Patches boots up an old pre-war terminal. The logs belong to General R.J. Rooney—'Roo'—and detail an argument over a project bearing his name. Project Roo, as Roo envisioned it, was a psychological warfare initiative meant to foster unity and love among troops, claiming, 'A soldier fights best for what he loves, not what he hates.'\n\nThe entries grow more heated as Roo defends his ideals against his subordinates, who push for fear and destruction as more effective tools. One log stands out: 'War is a house built on the ruins of peace. If we can't leave the door open for what comes after, then we've already lost.' The debate ends abruptly, hinting at Roo's vision being abandoned.\n\nNow, the Glowbugs must decide: will they honor Roo's dream of unity, or take the pragmatic, ruthless path his peers championed?"

Unfortunately, we're their first port of call in their storm. While Patches is happy to let the poor bastards in, many of our established residents are grousing at the prospect of thousands of fresh faces overwhelming their towns and hamlets.

  #Wild Wasteland Joke: I, Zusk, was told to finish McGebe's focus tree, and so was told to write the joke, when all that exists is the punchline. I decided to take a meta twist with this event, since it's for WW anyway.
  nf_glowbugs_refugee.8.title:0 "The Divine Comedy"
  nf_glowbugs_refugee.8.desc:0 "One starry night, Patches was gazing at the sky, wondering if there was a punchline to existence. That's when it happened. The heavens parted, a choir of radioactive angels hummed ominously, and a booming voice echoed down: 'Patches, my chosen jester, thou must write a joke about... Dirtman.'\nConfused but intrigued, Patches scribbled the name down. The next morning, he awoke to find Dirtman—just a guy, covered in dirt—sitting in the middle of the Dome. Dirtman didn't say much. He didn't *do* much. He was just... dirt. And a man.\nFor days, Patches wrestled with the setup, the punchline, the meaning of it all. 'What do you *do* with Dirtman?!' he wailed to Stitches, who only grunted in response. As the frustration mounted, Patches began to wonder if the joke was actually on *him.*\nNow, Patches faces a choice: Does he keep Dirtman and hope divine inspiration finally hits? Or does he boot this cosmic dirtbag back to wherever he came from?"

They've got homes, they've got work, and they've got a damn chance.'\n\nSure, the supplies are stretched thin, and Black Canyon's watching like hawks, but the Glowbugs are stronger for it. His gamble paid off, and despite the odds, the refugees have become a part of the community—proof that compassion and determination can thrive, even in the wasteland."

He adjusts the microphone and flashes his signature grin.\n'So, refugee crisis, huh? Funny thing about people showing up on your doorstep—you can't just slam the door and pretend you're not home. I tried that once with a Brotherhood squad, and trust me, it doesn't end well.'\n\nThe crowd chuckles as he paces the stage. 'But seriously, we had to make some tough calls. I said, "Hey, let's let in the ones who are gonna pitch in. You know, no radicals, no crazies, just folks who wanna help out." Black Canyon loved it. They were all, "Patches, you're a genius!" And I said, "No, I'm just a guy who hates paperwork but loves bottlecaps."'\n\nHe leans in close to the microphone, lowering his voice conspiratorially. 'Now, don't get me wrong, we still had some hiccups. Like that one guy who tried to pay his way in with a box of sugar bombs and a glowing mole rat. Good deal, but I had to say no.'\n\nThe crowd erupts in laughter, and Patches raises his arms triumphantly. 'But look at us now! Refugees are happy, Black Canyon's happy, and I'm happy because I get to take all the credit. And isn't that what leadership is all about? Thank you, thank you—I'll be here all week!'"

This influx has overwhelmed the Glowbugs' capacity to govern, and Patches and Stitches both agree—extra land is needed to handle the newcomers properly.\nRockriver, sparsely populated and currently managed by Black Canyon, is the Glowbugs' ideal solution. The Glowbugs promise they'll bring order and stability to the region, integrating the refugees and turning Rockriver into a thriving settlement.\nHowever, Black Canyon's elites are split. Some see the Glowbugs' proposal as a pragmatic solution to a growing problem, while others warn against empowering them further. The decision lies with you: grant the Glowbugs Rockriver, or keep the state and deal with the chaos spilling into the north?"

  nf_glowbugs_refugee.12.desc:0 "Stitches stands at the gates of Black Canyon's capital, his glowing figure radiating both menace and exhaustion. With the refugee crisis overwhelming Glowbug territory, he has come to demand assistance—not as a favor, but as a debt owed.\n'We've been keeping the Dome together, feeding mouths that shouldn't even be our problem,' Stitches growls, glaring at the assembled Black Canyon officials. 'And what's the thanks we get? Nothing. If you won't step up, you better hope I don't decide this partnership isn't worth the trouble.'\nThe words hang heavy in the air. Black Canyon can either provide the requested supplies and manpower, risking a hit to their authority, or refuse, potentially making Stitches—and the Glowbugs—dangerously hostile."
  nf_glowbugs_refugee.12.a:0 "Fine, take what you need. Just go."
  nf_glowbugs_refugee.12.b:0 "You'll get nothing from us, Stitches."

  nf_glowbugs_refugee.13.desc:0 "Patches strides into Black Canyon's council chambers with his signature grin and a bouquet of wilted wasteland flowers. 'Gentlemen, ladies, assorted radiation-proof bureaucrats,' he begins, bowing theatrically, 'I come to you not as a leader but as a humble ghoul with a very big problem.'\n\nHe spins his pitch with charm and wit, recounting the Glowbugs' struggles to house, feed, and settle the ever-growing flood of refugees. 'You see, ghouls and refugees are a lot alike—we're scrappy, resilient, and just looking for a place to belong. But even the best of us need a little help sometimes.'\nPatches gestures broadly, as if to embrace the entire room. 'So, in the spirit of cooperation, compassion, and, let's be honest, avoiding an absolute mess in your northern borderlands, I kindly ask for your assistance. Think of it as an investment—in goodwill, community, and a lot fewer headaches down the road.'\nThe council murmurs, torn between his sincerity and the nagging fear that granting aid now might encourage more requests in the future."
