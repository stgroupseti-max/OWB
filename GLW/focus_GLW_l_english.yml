  glowbugs_nf:0 "Subordinate Glowbugs Focus Tree"
  #Starting Focuses
  glw_smoldering_ruins:0 "The Smoldering Ruins..."
  glw_smoldering_ruins_desc:0 "The Great War did not miss Boulder, as the Dome standing tall in the middle of the city was considered dangerous. The research facility was built to be fallout-proof and did survive the nuclear onslaught without a scratch. The town around it, well, not so much."
  glw_stitches_and_patches:0 "Stitches and Patches"
  glw_stitches_and_patches_desc:0 "The radiating bones of the city became completely uninhabitable, and the only ones who could survive in those conditions were the Glowing Ones, ghouls with a nuclear core within themselves. Their community is called the Glowbugs, and two ghouls of them struggle to be the de-facto leaders."
  glw_uneasy_alliance:0 "An Uneasy Alliance"
  glw_uneasy_alliance_desc:0 "Black Canyon has arrived for our help when we needed them most, but since their "noble act", we have to pay them a heavy price. We most certainly need their continuous assistance, but this alliance is shaky at best, and shameful at worst. Things will have to change, in one way or another."
  #glw_wagner_fm:0 "Tune to the Wagner FM!"
  #glw_wagner_fm_desc:0 "Wagner was shy at first, circling in the city perimeter for days before he made contact with us. While he never said us where he was from, he decided to stay in our circle and help us with different electrical and communication devices. His talent is more than welcome, we're just worried about what he wants from the Dome so much."
  #glw_invite_otto_steed:0 "Give Home for a Gifted Ghoul"
  #glw_invite_otto_steed_desc:0 "Otto Steed is a masterful engineer who specialises in waterworks and construction workmanship, and one without a home. Being a former resident of the Oahe Dam, the local raider gang massacred his old crew who tried to keep alive the facility that survived the last two centuries under their hands. He will be a lot safer in our city."
  #Refugee Crisis - 'Political Branch'
  glw_refugee_crisis:0 "Refugee Crisis from the East"
  glw_refugee_crisis_desc:0 "Refugees from the Houndlands are rolling in, and the Dome's bursting at the seams. Food and beds are running low, and tensions are rising fast.\nStitches pushes for practical solutions, while Patches tries to keep spirits up with jokes. It's a powder keg waiting to blow."
  glw_silent_dog:0 "The Silent Dog"
  glw_silent_dog_desc:0 "Stitches doesn't talk much, but his presence does all the work. A pre-War commando turned wasteland legend, he's got the respect of ghouls and the scars to back it up.\nNobody questions his leadership—if they know what's good for them."
  glw_control_from_pinned_position:0 "The Funny Guy"
  glw_control_from_pinned_position_desc:0 "Patches' old car-dealer charm survived two centuries and more rads than most could count. He's got a knack for making people laugh—or do what he wants.\nWhether he's haggling or sweet-talking, Patches always gets results."
  glw_tinder_for_firestorm:0 "A Tinder for a Firestorm"
  glw_tinder_for_firestorm_desc:0 "Scraping together weapons from Black Canyon wasn't easy, but the Glowbugs managed. Now it's time to teach the refugees how to use them.\nWith luck, they'll hit their enemies—and not themselves."
  glw_sweeping_up_pyre:0 "Sweeping Up the Pyre"
  glw_sweeping_up_pyre_desc:0 "More weapons, more ammo, more bang for the buck. Black Canyon's stash is ripe for the taking, and the Glowbugs are cashing in.\nWith firepower like this, even a ragtag group can put up a fight."
  glw_reinforce_border:0 "Reinforce the Border"
  glw_reinforce_border_desc:0 "The Dome's borders are tightening, with patrols keeping the chaos at bay. It's a tough call, but the Glowbugs can't afford to be overrun.\nSometimes, survival means saying no."
  glw_neckbreak_integration:0 "Neckbreak Integration"
  glw_neckbreak_integration_desc:0 "Refugees are being put to work in makeshift townships, earning their keep with sweat and scrap. It's not glamorous, but it works.\nAround here, if you're not helping, you're not staying."
  glw_handling_xenophobia:0 "Handling Xenophobia"
  glw_handling_xenophobia_desc:0 "Some smoothskins can't stomach the ghouls, even when they're saving the day. The Glowbugs have had enough of the bigotry.\nWhether through education or intimidation, respect is gonna be learned."
  glw_fireflies_in_the_garden:0 "Fireflies in the Garden"
  glw_fireflies_in_the_garden_desc:0 "Finding glowing ones among the refugees is rare, but always welcome. Their light isn't just literal—it's hope for the Dome.\nEvery firefly adds to the Glowbugs' shine."
  glw_loyalty_to_whom:0 "Loyalty - But to Whom?"
  glw_loyalty_to_whom_desc:0 "Patches knows how to talk his way into Black Canyon's good graces—and their supplies. A few jokes and a little charm go a long way.\nWhere his loyalty lies, though? That's anyone's guess."
  glw_friends_with_benefits:0 "Friends with Benefits"
  glw_friends_with_benefits_desc:0 "Battery of Mesa Verde. Being the leader of the Black Canyon federation, and one of the legendary wastelanders of the area, his character is simply stunning. Being our overlord as well really does not helps the situation, but his word and goodwill easily could sway the situation around here in any direction. Making everything even more complicated..."
  glw_the_bark:0 "The Bark..."
  glw_the_bark_desc:0 "Stitches has no love for Black Canyon. To him, they're nothing but bigoted bullies who only use the Glowbugs because they can't handle the Dome's rads themselves.\nThis refugee crisis might just be the leverage he needs to turn up the pressure."
  glw_the_bite:0 "... or the Bite"
  glw_the_bite_desc:0 "Stitches never played nice with Battery and his crew, and his hostility has strained relations for years. Now, he's gone and ransacked one of Black Canyon's armories.\nDiplomacy's out the window, and the Glowbugs are bracing for the fallout."
  glw_creates_fallen_from_back_off_brahmin:0 "The 'Two Generals' Problem'"
  glw_creates_fallen_from_back_off_brahmin_desc:0 "If Black Canyon won't meet our demands, why should we meet theirs? Skimming off the top of our shipments seems fair.\nDumb smoothskins like them won't notice a little salvage going missing—probably."
  glw_creates_fallen_from_back_off_brahmin_tt:0 "§gWho says they won't notice if we skim some of the salvage for ourselves?§!"
  glw_bitter_honey:0 "Poisoned Honey"
  glw_bitter_honey_desc:0 "Offering Black Canyon something sweet while slipping them something lethal? That's a Patches classic.\nThey'll never see the poison until it's too late, and by then, the Glowbugs will have the last laugh."
  glw_leash_we_know:0 "The Leash That 'Least We Know"
  glw_leash_we_know_desc:0 "Sometimes it's better to stay with the devil you know. A weak dog might get pulled by its master, but a strong dog?\nIt can turn the leash into a weapon—and maybe drag the master along for a change."
  glw_leash_we_know_tt:0 "§gYou know, the support we get for our salvage actually isn't so bad. Let's send them even more at the same rate!§!"
  glw_bratting_rights:0 "Bratting Rights"
  glw_bratting_rights_desc:0 "Patches was always fancy about Battery, maybe even more than it is healthy or reasonable. With his charm somehow achieved that from time to time lesser gifts have been sent over his way, which were used up privately. Clearly not a healthy boss-subordinate relation."
  glw_our_people_pleaser:0 "Our People Pleaser"
  glw_our_people_pleaser_desc:0 "Patches lost a bet, and now he's stuck performing standup for the soldiers. A crowd full of grumpy, battle-hardened ghouls? What a loser!"
  glw_fateful_night:0 "In War and in Love..."
  glw_fateful_night_desc:0 "Stitches and Patches couldn't be further apart when it comes to dealing with Black Canyon. Stitches wants to blow the system sky-high, while Patches prefers a more refined touch.\nThis time, only one will get the chance to see their vision through."
  glw_gun_its_holster:0 "A Gun Back in its Holster"
  glw_gun_its_holster_desc:0 "Stitches lost a bet, and now he's back on the front lines, fighting with the army. Guess even a tough guy like him can't dodge bad luck forever!"

  #Political Branch (Stitches)
  #glw_stitches_to_snitches:0 "Stitches for the Snitches"
  #glw_stitches_to_snitches_desc:0 "Patches always has a plan and the only thing that could go astray is if somebody would snitch up for Black Canyon about what are we planning. While the rougher of our two ghouls is in the lead, he will remove some of the less flexible people from their inner circle."
  #glw_change_of_attitude:0 "Change of Attitude"
  #glw_change_of_attitude_desc:0 "The time of appeasing is over! We have nothing to replay to Black Canyon, and if we ever had, we already paid that price already. They doing nothing just exploiting us, so this connection needs to be severed. If they do not let us go, then we'll cut in by ourselves."
  #glw_our_hard_work:0 "Skim on the Next Shipment"
  #glw_our_hard_work_desc:0 "While probably Battery wouldn't appreciate it, we could skim on our next shipment a little and could use our resources for ourselves. Some scraps and pre-war construction materials could repair some old facilities that had been decaying since the bombs fell."
  #glw_saved_blood:0 "Our Saved Blood"
  #glw_saved_blood_desc:0 "The pointless war in northern Colorado was a bloodbath, and we decided well that we skipped it completely. While our disobedience will find its own punishment someday, until that, we can happily cherish the lives we saved with our decision."
  #glw_renounce_treaty_of_williams:0 "Renounce the Treaty of Williams"
  #glw_renounce_treaty_of_williams_desc:0 "The Treaty of Williams was shameful for us to sign, but back in the day, we had no other choice. We gave up our independence for some shaky security, our wealth has been siphoned away from us called a tax, all for a stinky town and laughable know-how. From this day on, we'll not send any more resource shipment into the Penitentiary, and if Black Canyon doesn't like it, they can try and take it away from us with force. We'll be ready."
  #glw_renounce_treaty_of_williams_tt:0 "§gA step §Rdrastic§! as this will let us take some powerful measures to effectively take down our overlord, but at the same time, will attract its attention. If we try to do this while §Y[BLC.GetName]§! isn't occupied with more important matters, they surely will counter-measure our action. §RTread carefully§!. §RYou have been warned§!.§!"
  #glw_partnerships_of_equals:0 "I Get Wicked"
  #glw_partnerships_of_equals_desc:0 "Burning away everything that we secured until this point would be completely foolish. Our town developed somewhat under the yoke of the Canyonites, and we have a healthy relationship with the people of the federates people. The raiders of Tibbets, the painted tribals and even the settlers in the Riverbend, all despise the Caravan, and with the right initiative, we could coordinate with them to strike down on Battery's posse."
  #glw_partnerships_of_equals_tt:0 "§gA §Gcareful§! step as it will hinder our final preparations against §Y[BLC.GetName]§!, it will take some time before they realize something is amiss. Keep a close eye on your suspicion counter - Black Canyon will be on the move after you exceed §R3§!. §RAlways tread carefully§!. §RYou have been warned§!.§!"

  #glw_rapid_militarization:0 "Rapid Militarization"
  #glw_rapid_militarization_desc:0 "While converting old shops into gun manufacturies and making toolmakers craft weapons is both questionable and alerting, we need to get ready to strike as quickly as it is possible. Because if we don't hit first, then they will."
  #glw_civilian_drills:0 "Drilling 'Militia Recruits'"
  #glw_civilian_drills_desc:0 "Our secretly admitted officers were hidden amongst our militia units for a while now. Operation Drill will need us to get over our already made plans and perfect them - and while we're at it, we should drill our actual recruits as well."
  #glw_hire_iron_mercenaries:0 "Pay the Iron Price"
  #glw_hire_iron_mercenaries_desc:0 "We'll need every fighting force in Colorado to take down Black Canyon and for that, we'll have to hire some mercenaries as well. While the §Y[IRN.GetNameWithFlag]§! is the price is high, they will deliver the lead we need."

  #glw_fireflies_between_glowbugs:0 "The Fireflies"
  #glw_fireflies_between_glowbugs_desc:0 "The Fireflies are our oldest ghouls to date, and most of them either have pre-war military knowledge, wasteland survival wisdom or most of the time, both! They're quite adamant about the Right to Bearing Arms as well, so they will bring their own now, that they're ready to directly support our cause. The only thing we left is to organize them into a proper force..."
  #glw_boiled_up_anger:0 "Boiled Up Anger"
  #glw_boiled_up_anger_desc:0 "I'm pretty sure this doesn't necessitate more comments than necessary. Not only does Stitches feels that we're exploited, or got mishandled by the less liberal normies from the Canyon. We're angry and awake, and they should be ready to endure our wrath."
  #glw_expropriate_boulder_dome:0 "Expropriate the Dome"
  #glw_expropriate_boulder_dome_desc:0 "The Dome is the wonder of Colorado, and yet, very little has happened this far to discover the secrets its holds. We clearly have no access to the know-how to unravel it, but even with our limited knowledge, we could break the off-limits rules and turn some former systems to work. Probably we'll break a thing or two in the process, but, who cares, really."
  #glw_painted_help:0 "Get a Matching Tattoo with the Warded"
  #glw_painted_help_desc:0 "The Warded and the Painted Men are quite freakish about tattoos and such, and as long we need their assistance, we should do their equivalent of "blood-oath", getting a matching tattoo. An "ink-oath", maybe? Anyway, before Stitches skin started to disappear, he had some military tattoos, so getting back a part of its past would be nice."
  #glw_raider_assist:0 "Get Hammered with Mallet"
  #glw_raider_assist_desc:0 "If you want to get the help of a raider, you have to earn its respect. And how other would you earn the respect of a raider if not beating him in a drinking contest? The bodies of ghouls are a lot more sturdy when it comes to toxins and such, but Stitches was always a heavy drinker, so he's a heavyweight drinking champion. I'd say the odds are even."
  #glw_my_enemy_enemy_is_my_friend:0 "Revisit the Concession with Bearhard"
  #glw_my_enemy_enemy_is_my_friend_desc:0 "The Yampans' only problem with us is that we "took" Laramie from them. The thing is, it was gifted to us from Battery, probably mainly to raise tensions between us. That town was almost completely deserted, but since we moved in, it flourish - so we'd like to keep it, it better for trading for the normies as well. But we should work out some compensation or renting contract so they don't feel so robbed either."
  #glw_ghosts_in_their_shell:0 "Ghosts Out of Their Shell"
  #glw_ghosts_in_their_shell_desc:0 "The Ghosts have been disbanded and expelled after the Black Canyon conquered Barren Valley. They normally hate very much Battery's posse, and as we have one of their old leader on board and ready, we could quite easily organize the remnants into a heavy-hitting force."
