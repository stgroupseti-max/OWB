  GLW_closed_ones_desc_desc:0 "The scavengers of Boulder nominally only have one leader, but technically it's more like two. While §OPatches§! leads the scavengers into the ruins and represents the community before the outsiders, §MStitches§! is the head of the militia, and such has a lot of influence over the nation's affairs.\n\nLet's say that they see very differently in which directions Boulder should go on. Everybody knows they're having something going on, and if they're asked about it, they always answer that "they're indeed close". If they mean by that they're good friends, brothers or lovers, we cannot tell for sure. But until their rivalry is resolved, our people cannot be certain about their tomorrow either."
