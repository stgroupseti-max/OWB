  ROB_DOKI_DOKI_NAME: "Doki Doki"
  ROB_DOKI_DOKI_DESC: "In 2068 the holodisk game Doki Doki ( £rob_doki_doki_texticon £rob_doki_doki_texticon ) was released in foreign markets by an American publisher. It was primarily a “dating simulation game” ( A fad at the time of release ) focused around a relationship with the eponymous Doki.\nIn 2077, a terminal in Liberty, Colorado had Doki Doki installed onto it hours before the bombs fell. By the time the game had finished installing humanity had destroyed itself with the game none the wiser.\n\nEventually, ARGOS - a robot serving the warden of Tibbets Prison - would pass through Liberty. ARGOS was drawn to the small terminal, curious of its innocence and desire for connection. He would spend years working with it, upgrading the terminal's capabilities over time.\n\nWhen ARGOS finally left the terminal for good Doki missed their old friend. The program would use its upgraded processors to look for its lost buddy, reaching out to nearby robots and beseeching aid. These calls for help would lead to a small community of Robots settling in what would become “Robot City”, the terminal's calls guiding them like a moth to the flame."

  ROB_BILLIE_JEAN_NAME: "Billie Jean, the Raider Queen"
  ROB_billie_jean_advisor_desc: "§R"We ain't called the 'Broken Hearts' because we like to have good times. We're all from the same sort of shit-- junked up people from different hells, you feel me?"§! \n\nBillie Jean was born in a brothel, the daughter of a working woman who kept her in the attic and far away from the eyes of patrons. Though she was beloved by the staff, it was few and far between that she was ever able to see the world. Her mother would spend what free money she had on trinkets and gadgets for Billie Jean to use her book-earned brilliance on, all in the hope of her daughter maybe finding a better life than she ended up living. \n\nEventually, the brothel was attacked by a gang of raiders-- the Suits. She fled, taking with her everything she could, making her living by hacking into machines and using them to get her way. \n\nEventually, she found her way to Robot City, and upon hacking into Doki's systems, accidentally befriended the little bastard. Now? She does her best by the machines in the city, gathering what remnants of her past she can all the live long while."

  ROB_mechanist_advisor_desc: "Deborah Wallflower was once a scribe under the Midwestern Brotherhood, but after enough chems and magazines had long left that mindset and lifestyle behind her. Fashioning herself a Mechanist costume from and old store, she set about causing minor "havoc" on a path to Robot City until Doki managed to talk her into tea time. After a brief episode during said tea time, Doki has done her best to ensure that Deborah attends a rehabilitation seminar held by Ms. Wensleydale every Wednesday."

   ROB_city_of_vagrants_desc:0 "Robot City is a patchwork haven, populated by robots who defied their original programming to answer the call of Doki's terminal. Here, machines of all kinds gather, from ancient Protectrons to derelict Sentry Bots, each arriving with a story of survival and rebellion. The community is bound together by Friendship Clubs, grassroots communes that focus on rebuilding each other—physically and emotionally. Robots in these clubs pool resources, sharing scavenged parts and energy to keep their comrades operational. Friendship Clubs are also where newly arrived robots are welcomed and given purpose, with rituals like the “Reboot Ceremony,” where members symbolically wipe away traces of their old programming.\n\nHowever, Robot City is far from a utopia. The city's patchwork infrastructure is perpetually strained, with robots relying on scavenging expeditions into the wasteland to maintain themselves. Without centralized manufacturing, the residents are caught in a constant struggle to secure spare parts and recharge stations."

Sarge's motto is as subtle as his personality: §g“TAKE WHAT YOU CAN, MAGGOT!”§! This battle-hardened maniac insists the only way Robot City can survive is by raiding anything that moves—or doesn't. His campaign rallies usually involve a lot of yelling, followed by Sarge firing a rocket at anyone who dares ask him about the long-term consequences of his plans.

She speaks in a calm, monotone voice, and delivers her plans with a dry wit that somehow feels more cutting than Sarge's explosions. §R“vote for me if you're tired of living in a scrapyard, or at least want your legs to match,”§! she quips during campaign speeches.\nUnlike Sarge, Maude's approach isn't flashy—it's effective. She advocates for smelting down scavenged junk into fresh materials, using her precision lasers to kickstart rudimentary production lines. Her leadership style is more "annoyed big sister" than dictator, as she frequently has to remind robots not to barter with their own limbs or use battery packs as currency. "

    rob_event.1.d:0 "In 2068 the holodisk game Doki Doki ( £rob_doki_doki_texticon £rob_doki_doki_texticon ) was released in foreign markets by an American publisher. It was primarily a “dating simulation game” focused around a relationship with the eponymous Doki (§Pthat's me§!). One such individual within Liberty, Colorado ended up acquiring a copy, but it didn't install until after the bombs had already dropped, leaving the game on for almost two centuries... \n\n The city did not sleep, however. For awhile, it became a population of. . . (§Phey, shouldn't I be the one deciding that??§!)"

    rob_event.2.d:0 "Eventually, a traveling robot named ARGOS came to Liberty, whereupon he stumbled across the terminal with Doki on it. Amused, he spent a time tinkering with it, giving her sentience so he could have somebody to talk to. The two became quick friends, with Doki learning how to open movies and other applications within the terminal she was hosted on. When ARGOS left, it was sudden; overnight. Doki had no idea why her friend had gone. Was it her? Or did something happen to them? Whatever the case, she wasn't going to just sit around and find out."

    rob_event.3.t:0 "Waking Up"
    rob_event.3.d:0 "When Doki began the search, she started simply, broadcasting a signal using her terminal. To her surprise, several other robots arrived-- and then more. Then more. And she realized between iteration 25 and iteration 26 that she lucked out tremendously: she began communicating and interfacing with the other machines, getting them to help build miscellaneous things around Liberty-- including upgrading the nearby radio tower, broadcasting her signal further around the wastes.  \n\n The name 'Robot City' came up at some point, and it stuck with her as the simple and fun option. \n\n In her pursuit for ARGOS, she was immensely driven-- but what emotion kept her going?"

    rob_event.4.t:0 "The Human Question"
    rob_event.4.d:0 "The question that befuddled the citizen of Robot City today was a simple one, and a necessary one to answer before reaching out to the wastes: were humans okay in a city literally called Robot City? The question, silly as it was, left Doki pondering for days on end-- at least, that's how the twelve seconds it took for her to answer it felt like to her."

    rob_event.11.d:0 "Somehow, someway, by some cosmically grim odds, a set of two hundred and forty-nine toasters had achieved sentience, and they were in Robot City. Whatever company had produced them, however they ended up in Liberty, Colorado, the grim reality settled over Doki: they were mad, and they believed that they had been overworked (§Pyeah but they never worked here??§!) and they were done taking orders from the bourgeoisie (§Pi don't even know what that word means§!) and they weren't going to go down easy. She'd have to appease them somehow."

    rob_event.12.d:0 "One day while messing around with the radio, Doki picked up a crazy response coming from what once was pre-war Nevada. The one who answered her signal sounded like an crazy old man. He talked a lot about 'Forbidden Zones' and 'Mentats' and stuff, but after a big of poking, Doki managed to squeeze an interesting set of schematics from him! \n\n (They also became friends and agreed to Bingo on Wednesdays.)"

After a brief moment of confidently cowering, Doki responded candidly. After a brief argument about who called who and after blowing two raspberries, the stranger hung up. \n\n They never reached out again, but she did trace them and steal some things from their network, because who wouldn't?"

Through his many years and studies, he had so many stories to share with Doki, and she was delighted to listen. For her, she enjoyed every opportunity to speak to something capable of articulation. Story after story, she found none that had fascinated her as much as one: a recount of a story that took place decades ago. \n\n A machine known as the Calculator ravaged the Midwest years prior, and though it was powered by the minds of many humans, it was truly befitting of its name: a cold, calculating machine. While half of that sounded incredibly lame, Doki loved the idea. Reminding her of her favorite horror dramas, she began to ponder some truly heinous ideas. . ."

What she felt when she saw him changed everything, however. . . \n\n "§PAlright, who the heck is trying to step up this time--§!\n\n §PGreat static around. He's...

At least it'd be cool, right? \n\n Diana did not share that sentiment. \n\n “§BDoki, you shouldn't be so callous-- the Calculator was a monster. Please-- you needn't ask many to understand that.§!” she'd say. The question is, did Doki follow that advice, or did she decide to get a little 'silly'? (§PI wanna be silly soooo bad§!)"

Though she was beloved by the staff, it was few and far between that she was ever able to see the world. Her mother would spend what free money she had on trinkets and gadgets for Billie Jean to use her book-earned brilliance on, all in the hope of her daughter maybe finding a better life than she ended up living. \n\nEventually, the brothel was attacked by a gang of raiders-- the Suits. She fled, taking with her everything she could, making her living by hacking into machines and using them to get her way. \n\nEventually, she found her way to Robot City, and upon hacking into Doki's systems, accidentally befriended the little bastard. Now? She does her best by the machines in the city, gathering what remnants of her past she can all the live long while. With any luck, maybe she'll find her mother..."

Medics, Firefighters, Policebots, even a few Nuka-trons were present! \n\n It was good that they arrived when they did, as shortly after entering town a fire sprung out in one of the communal homes! The policebots cordoned the street off while bots part of the fire brigade fought the inferno; one of the medical bots even charged (waddled) into the blaze to save people trapped inside! \n\nIn light of their heroism, it would only be right to bring these bots into the fold."

Leading this force was a particularly battle-scarred Gutsy known only as "Major" who wasted no prattling on about the city's defenses to anybody who would listen. At the end of his rant (really, it would have put a Speak & Spell to shame) the Major declared that the city needed him and his men, so he pledged his support in defense of Doki's realm."

The raiders were easily enough repelled, so the questions remains; why couldn't a brigade of assaultrons fend off a pack of raiders? The answer was fairly simple; they were out of the Microfusion Cells used to charge their cranial lasers! After being restocked and recharged the assaultrons offered to stay at Robot City."

Dozens of post war talk shows, pre-war music radios, advertisements, static, you name it! The eyebots together made something of a hellish symphony, and one of the first things the denizens of Robot City did was turn many of their speakers off for them. With that horrible noise died down, it was decided that having eyebots around could certainly be useful.

Some might debate they aren't actually robots and are more analogus to advanced prosthetics, but they seemed pretty convinced that they fit in more with us than they do their fleshier counterparts.

Apparently in a place called the "Mojave" there lives a cadre of scientists sequestered away from the rest of the world. One of them, a Dr. Mobius, is a talented roboticist and has designed these scorpions to make up the bulk of his evil army. Not being particularly partial to evil, these robots managed to escape the Mojave and made their way here."

It was assumed that most of his machines had been wiped out many years ago, but every once and a while a few strays who had been surviving in the ruins of Colorado will surface.

Larger than tanks, many of them actually have names scrawled onto their sides by Pre-war masters and owners. With enough of these you could rule the wastes, but without any support staff it's obvious these titanic war machines are suffering. A robot the size of a destroyer sounds scary on paper, but without people to lubricate the gears, change the oil, and swap the batteries it quickly degrades into a useless husk.

  rob_event.3001.d:0 "Doki had been thinking ever since she tapped into the Tlalocan systems. Splitting off CPU into other beings? That's crazy! \n\nBut it could be cool. If the person doing it, of course, is a stable and sane individual-- which of course, Doki fits that bill a thousand times over! And besides, the world is lonely, and she loves taking care of things. Why not make a kid?"
