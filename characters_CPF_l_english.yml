  SBR_LUGNUT_DESC:0 "Although only recently having gained enough power to be considered serious contenders in their own right, the Smashers have long been players in Vote Runs. Whether they did it for fame, profit, or just fun is up to each to decide for themselves. But with the recent ascension of Lugnut the Smashers have a new outlook, survival. Because they have been on the frontline of most every engagement in the Electorals they know firsthand just how precarious their traditions and society are, and they'll crush Heaven and Earth before they see themselves subject to anyone else's will."

  ELB_SCRAPHEAP_DESC:0 "Father Scrapheap, 3rd Archpriest of the Parish of Elbo, Holy Overseer of the Church of Saskatchewan, and Grand Laicizer of the Daemon Gabriel.\n\nFather Scrapheap had long hated the blood sport they called elections. So when Pierre shocked the Electorate by ursurping Dundurn, Father Scrapheap shocked the Parish and murdered the servant of Lucifer known as "Father" Gabriel during a sermon. Following this execution Scrapheap declared Elbo's immediate resignation from the Electorate. “If you have to ask how much it costs, you can't afford it.”\n\nBlessed are you, O Elbo;\nWho is like you, a people saved by the Lord,\nWho is the shield of your help\nAnd the sword of your majesty!\nSo your enemies will cringe before you,\nAnd you will tread upon their high places."
  #CPF_TOONIE_DESC:0 "Despite only being a newcomer to the region, the Bank End Bandits have managed to succeed in monopolizing the regions finances. Toonie himself being an illusive man, very few know exactly how he continues to scheme, swindle, and steal with no reprisal. Many who have met with him tell of an angry and vengeful person, with no regard to who he insults. The kind of man who would be shot without a second thought in the rest of the wasteland, but alas is protected by very deep pockets.\n\nMoney talks. Toonie Stalks."

  FRG_PATTYWACK_DESC:0 "”Let’s keep Pleasantdale Pleasant, folks! Here’s a thought: genetically engineered police force. How? The old factory. It’s got tons of this crazy stuff we can use. Where? Toboggan said it best— we have the highest mortality rate in infants for miles. Take the ones that are sick, throw ‘em in the program. How, part 2? Take that diseased baby, slather it up in that goo, and train it to be the best. Keep in mind, folks, if you think it’s dehumanizing, then think about it like this: they’ll never know it was gonna be any different— and there wasn’t any other way they were gonna make it. At that rate, it’s just a charity program, ultimately. What do you say?” —Maxwell Chase, Mayor of Pleasantdale\n\nMany of the Faeries created by Pleasantdale had limited intelligence and communicative skills. Pattywack, however, had the benefit of a good teacher and a spry attitude- now, in the woods north of the Electorals, she seeks to return back to Pleasantdale and stop the Faerie production once and for all... And, hopefully, to cure her kinsfolk of their inevitable, oakey end."
