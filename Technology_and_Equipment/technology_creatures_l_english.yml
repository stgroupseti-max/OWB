  molerat_upgrade_tech_1:0 "Mining Suits"
  molerat_upgrade_tech_1_desc:0 "Even as mutant bodies provide quite a challenge to our outfitters, we should still seek to equip them with proper protection. The mining armor is composed of a lightweight, skin-tight undersuit reinforced in key points with integrated leather pads, as well as low-profil steel plating. Included are also mining claws, ables to rip through enemies and terrain alike."
  molerat_upgrade_tech_2:0 "HEDP Explosives"
  molerat_upgrade_tech_2_desc:0 "Providing what amount to battle sappers with dual-purpose weaponry is always a challenge, but our engineered have managed to manufacture a new grenade, composed of a strong central blasting element with a copper liner, and surrounded by a fragmenting charge with integrated ball bearings. This makes it not only useful for demolition purposes, but also effective as an offensive weaponry against armor and personel alike."
  molerat_upgrade_tech_3:0 "Lightweight Battle Rifle"
  molerat_upgrade_tech_3_desc:0 "Mutants can withstand quite a bit more recoil than normal humans, so we have decided to take some of our battle rifle prototypes and rechamber them for a shortened 15mm cartridge, as well as shedding any unnecessary weight and shortening their barrels to make them akin to carbines. With such heavy firepowers on their side that can be taken on any digging operation, our troops shall not be found lacking."

  burrowing_beast_unlock_tech:0 "Burrowing Cohort"
  burrowing_beast_unlock_tech_desc:0 "Battles can be fought on the sea and in the air, but what of the land? Taming creatures that can dig into dirt, rock, and even harder materials in seconds gives not only an advantage in the short term, but can be enhanced to provide long-term tactical benefits."
  burrowing_beast_upgrade_tech_1:0 "Stone Breakers"
  burrowing_beast_upgrade_tech_1_desc:0 "Burrowing through not just soft earth but solid rock and stone requires some extra hard claws. With a little artificial selection we've been able to get our critters claws hard as steel, able to surprise our foes from exciting new angles and tear through puny flesh and armor with ease."
  burrowing_beast_intermediate_form:0 "Rabid Mole Rats"
  burrowing_beast_intermediate_form_desc:0 ""
  burrowing_beast_upgrade_tech_2:0 "Burrow Instinct"
  burrowing_beast_upgrade_tech_2_desc:0 "Digging is second nature to our beasts, and even when not directed they will begin building intricate networks of tunnels, dens, and redoubts beneath the ground. These tunnels are surprisingly good at regulating their own temperature with airflow, and make it difficult for an attacker to find and flush them all out."
  burrowing_beast_glowing_form:0 "Glowing Mole Rats"
  burrowing_beast_glowing_form_desc:0 ""
  burrowing_beast_upgrade_tech_3:0 "Glowing Strong"
  burrowing_beast_upgrade_tech_3_desc:0 "It's common wisdom in the wasteland that a glowing mutant is always more dangerous than a not-glowing one. Selectively irradiating our diggers at a young age might reduce the breeding population, but the survivors come out stronger than ever and able to be healed - not harmed by radiation. And given the amount of nuclear waste in the soil, they certainly have no shortage of places to hide and recover."

  burrowing_beast_brood_form_desc:0 ""
  burrowing_beast_upgrade_tech_4:0 "Fresh Litters"
  burrowing_beast_upgrade_tech_4_desc:0 "Our burrowing creatures have a tendency to reproduce quickly in large batches, after which the young stick close to the mother for a while. For less hardy creatures this might need to be downtime away from the field, but instead these babies are able to work as a swarm to help protect their mother in the field, and the rage of one dying sends the mother into a furious rampage against the enemy. The survivors come out of the ordeal already accustomed to a life of violence and ready to be trained."

  insect_beast_upgrade_tech_1:0 "Unified Direction"
  insect_beast_upgrade_tech_1_desc:0 "Not every Insect out there is truly Eusocial, but it's a strange trend that the giant mutated ones are more likely to get along with each other than their miniscule counterparts. We should encourage this behavior and get our bugs used to fighting in swarms, rather than as individual soldiers!"
  insects_intermediate_tech:0 "Irradiated Radroaches"

  insect_beast_upgrade_tech_2:0 "Aggressive Behavior"
  insect_beast_upgrade_tech_2_desc:0 "Pity, shame, restraint, these are all very human emotions that insects have no concept of. Breeding more and more violent bugs might be dangerous to the handlers but it'll be more dangerous to our enemies - the swarm will have no remorse, and show no mercy!"

  insect_beast_upgrade_tech_3:0 "Size And Numbers"
  insect_beast_upgrade_tech_3_desc:0 "Conventional wisdom would sugget that making a creature bigger would mean it's harder to sustain bigger populations. Conventional wisdom can stuff it! We've made our bugs even bigger than the apocalypse did, and they're still breeding just as fast, if not faster!"

  amphibious_beast_unlock_tech:0 "Amphibious Creatures"
  amphibious_beast_upgrade_tech_1:0 "Proper Feed"
  amphibious_beast_upgrade_tech_1_desc:0 "Mirelurks generally rely on a scavenger's diet, which means practically everything they can get their claws on. Changing their diet for one with proper food, and giving only the best and most nutritious prisoners to our soldiers will let them be at peakt performance at all time."
  amphibious_beast_intermediate_form:0 "Mirelurk Killclaws"
  amphibious_beast_upgrade_tech_2:0 "Metabolic Boost"
  amphibious_beast_upgrade_tech_2_desc:0 "By stimulating Mirelurks with the right combinations of drugs, one can increase their metabolism to run rampant. They move quicker, fight harder, and even manage to regenerate quicker. Just be careful once supply runs out."
  amphibious_beast_armor_form:0 "Bloodrage Mirelurk"
  amphibious_beast_upgrade_tech_3:0 "Advanced Breeding"
  amphibious_beast_upgrade_tech_3_desc:0 "Selective breeding as well as special "techniques" will allow us to form a superior warrior caste, with improved combat capabilities, as well as generally much better physical conditions. Keeping up a high rate of birth and using non-selected mirelurks as support instead of frontline troops also insures proper rear-line troops."
  amphibious_beast_king_form:0 "Mirelurk King"
  amphibious_beast_upgrade_tech_4:0 "Sonic Projectile"
  amphibious_beast_upgrade_tech_4_desc:0 "Uniquely, Mirelurk Kings seem capable of emitting a focused burst of sound that can injure and disorient."

  deathclaw_unlock_tech:0 "Young Deathclaws"
  deathclaw_infantry_unlock_tech:0 "Deathclaw Civilization"
  deathclaw_infantry_unlock_tech_desc:0 "Our society is either primarily centered around unusually cooperative nests of fearsome Deathclaws led by Matriarchs and their powerful mates, or contains the means to tame and direct vast numbers of the beasts."

  deathclaw_upgrade_top_1:0 "Vicious Claws"
  deathclaw_upgrade_top_1_desc:0 "What would a Deathclaw be without its namesake claws? Already their claws are some of the strongest in the wasteland, able to tear through armor with repeated force, but with a little reinforcement and regular maintenance we could get them even sharper and more deadly against the weak, soft bodies of our enemies."
  deathclaw_upgrade_bottom_1:0 "Mighty Horns"
  deathclaw_upgrade_bottom_1_desc:0 "A deathclaw can already slice through anything it needs to, what use is there making them better when they're already the best? Their horns, however, leave much to be desired as weapons. Breeding for larger horns and more muscular necks could turn our Deathclaws into living battering rams, able to knock over enemy vehicles or power armor with ease!"
  deathclaw_creature_tech_2:0 "Deathclaws"
  deathclaw_upgrade_top_2:0 "Powerful Musculature"
  deathclaw_upgrade_top_2_desc:0 "The muscular system of our Deathclaws is almost grotesque in how defined it is, sinew and muscles almost visible under their skin. But our doctors have started telling us that looking like that isn't actually the sign that they're healthy beasts of pure muscles we thought it was, that these eating machines are actually malnourished if they look like that! New diets and extra layers of cushioning fat will apparently enable them to output their full, herculean strength more often!" #Bodybuilders and strongmen look very different, and for a good reason. The Anemic once seen in 3/NV are probably less healthy than the more fatty, less defined ones in 4.
  deathclaw_upgrade_top_3:0 "Quadrupedal Charge"
  deathclaw_upgrade_top_3_desc:0 "With their full health resotred our Deathclaws have been able to show us what they can REALLY do with a burst of energy - a full speed sprint on all fours into enemy lines. With a clear path even power armor can't hope to outrun their charge!"
  deathclaw_upgrade_bottom_2:0 "Iron Hides"
  deathclaw_upgrade_bottom_2_desc:0 "A Deathclaws hide is one of the toughest in the wasteland, but it could always be better. Special treatments to harden their scales and crude armor could go a long way to turn our Deathclaws into walking tanks. They even seem to know it too, losing what little fear of guns and fire they had left once realize how tough they really are!"
  deathclaw_upgrade_bottom_3:0 "Thermoregulation"
  deathclaw_upgrade_bottom_3_desc:0 "A lot of people think Deathclaws are reptiles, but that isn't really true. What they are is genetic abominations, that don't care the least bit about how other animals function. Ours have evolved to be warm blooded, able to handle extreme temperatures better than any mere reptile could, and letting us field them in more climates our enemies would never excpect."
  deathclaw_creature_tech_3:0 "Alpha Deathclaws"
  deathclaw_upgrade_top_4:0 "Patient Hunter"
  deathclaw_upgrade_top_4_desc:0 "Overwhelming force is still best used sparingly. Our Deathclaws are remarkably intelligent, clever enough to stalk their prey and wait until the ideal moment to strike. The Deathclaw you don't see is more terrifying than the one you do."
  deathclaw_upgrade_bottom_4:0 "Killing Blow"
  deathclaw_upgrade_bottom_4_desc:0 "The Deathclaw has always been the apex predator of the wasteland, and now they're the apex predator of our army! Even the most loyal soldiers will turn tail and run when they see the ferocity of our Deathclaws ripping apart their companions. And all it takes is a little psycho and a direction to run to set them into a frenzy that reduces targets to a thin red paste!"

  deathclaw_special_forces_unlock_tech:0 "Alpha Deathclaws"
  deathclaw_special_forces_unlock_tech_desc:0 "Exceptionally powerful deathclaws eventually grow into Alphas. Bigger, stronger, and meaner than the usual deathclaw, they're easily some of the toughest mutants in the entire wasteland. Squads led by them are limited, but nigh unstoppable."

  feral_ghouls_unlock_tech:0 "Sheparding Ferals"
  feral_ghouls_upgrade_1:0 "Fearless Violence"
  feral_ghouls_upgrade_1_desc:0 "One of the most unsettling traits of feral mutants is their complete lack of fear or any semblance of self-preservation. No matter how dangerous the situation they'll throw themselves headlong into danger without an ounce of hesitation or doubt, often to gory effects."
  feral_ghouls_intermediate_form:0 "Feral Ghoul Roamers"
  feral_ghouls_upgrade_2:0 "Endless Walk"
  feral_ghouls_upgrade_2_desc:0 "Mutants in the wasteland don't need sleep in the same way normal living beings do, often capable of wandering for days, weeks, months even years continuously without ever stopping to rest. An army without the need for sleep is an army that's always ready, so let's make sure they stay awake."
  feral_ghouls_armored_form:0 "Feral Ghoul Reavers"
  feral_ghouls_upgrade_3:0 "Full Body Armor"
  feral_ghouls_upgrade_3_desc:0 "Armoring up our mutants has worked so far, but experience has helped us figure out exactly what ways they differ from normal humans and how to better adapt armor for where they actually need it, and leave it off where they don't."
  feral_ghouls_glowing_form:0 "Glowing Ones"
  feral_ghouls_upgrade_4:0 "Constant Radiation Emission"
  feral_ghouls_upgrade_4_desc:0 "Radiation is capable of repairing a mutant's flesh so quickly it almost seems like magic. Making sure a constant source of radioactive material is always available for our mutant hordes will keep them regenerating even in the heat of battle, and even mutants our enemies thought dead will rise again to keep fighting."

  war_beasts_unlock_tech:0 "Taming Post-War Animals"
  war_beasts_unlock_tech_desc:0 "People have been taming animals for thousands of years, and in the wasteland we're no different, even if the animals are. With a little tender love and care even mutant animals can be turned into friends, or at least useful allies."
  war_beasts_first_form_tech:0 "Training War Beasts"
  war_beasts_upgrade_1:0 "Strong Collars"
  war_beasts_upgrade_1_desc:0 "Whether it's basic armor or to prevent creatures from breaking free, reinforcing the collars and harnesses we use to control our beasts could help prevent losses in the field and even open up the potential of taming more difficult creatures."
  war_beasts_intermediate_form_tech:0 "Bighorners"
  war_beasts_upgrade_2:0 "Desensitization Training"
  war_beasts_upgrade_2_desc:0 "The flash of fire, the boom of a gunshot, the screams of dying beasts, there's a lot of horrifying things our beasts can experience in war. To prevent panic and disorder in their ranks, we should start exposing them to these things in safer, controlled environments until they get used to them and don't lose their composure in the field."
  war_beasts_heavy_form_tech:0 "Yao Guai"
  war_beasts_upgrade_3:0 "Hardy Bloodlines"
  war_beasts_upgrade_3_desc:0 "Selective breeding has always been used to make stronger, more optimized animals for whatever job humanity needed done. We're no different, and now we have a few pedigree bloodlines going renowned for their exceptional abilities in key areas that we can continue to carefully cultivate."
  war_beasts_upgrade_4:0 "Family Dynamic"
  war_beasts_upgrade_4_desc:0 "Mammals, even the most aloof are by their very nature family-oriented creatures that usually care for their young. Cultivating this instinct in our beasts and making ourselves a part of their "family dynamic" will make them even more loyal and determined to fight alongside us in the field."
  war_beasts_dusky_form_tech:0 "Dusky Yao Guai"
  war_beasts_stalker_form_tech:0 "Night Stalkers"
  war_beasts_upgrade_5:0 "Nocturnal Hunting"
  war_beasts_upgrade_5_desc:0 "The dark of night is a useful cover for ambush hunters, enabling them to quietly slip in undetected until it's too late for their prey. Working with these hunters has made us better at adapting to silent night time attacks, and better at spotting those trying to hide from us too."
  war_beasts_upgrade_6:0 "Potent Venom"
  war_beasts_upgrade_6_desc:0 "Poison is an effective tool for a hunter, able to gurantee a victorious hunt with only a glancing blow. Intensifying the potency of our beast's venom will enable our beasts to rush in and attack then pull out and wait for the poison to finish their targets off in safety."

  gecko_support_unlock_tech:0 "Gecko Husbandry"
  gecko_support_upgrade_1:0 "Favor Strength"
  gecko_support_upgrade_1_desc:0 "Geckos Hides are renowned for their durability so much so that they're used to reinforce armor, but what's little discussed is their jaw strength. Breeding geckos with bigger fangs and even stronger jaw muscles will enable even bigger, better bites."
  gecko_support_golden_tech:0 "Golden Geckos"
  gecko_support_upgrade_2:0 "Personal Handlers"
  gecko_support_upgrade_2_desc:0 "Despite assumptions to the contrary Geckos are actually fairly social creatures that travel in groups. Enabling them to bond with specific handlers will hopefully increase their loyalty, and allowing soldiers to bring their own pet Geckos into battle will bring even more of them to the front."
  gecko_support_fire_tech:0 "Fire Geckos"
  gecko_support_green_tech:0 "Green Geckos"
  gecko_support_upgrade_3:0 "New Generation"
  gecko_support_upgrade_3_desc:0 "An entirely new generation of Geckos has been born, bred with a variety of subspecies and combining some of their best traits. The new Geckos are much healthier and hardier than those taken from the wild, and seem more sociable and loyal as well."
  gecko_support_upgrade_4:0 "Strong Genes"
  gecko_support_upgrade_4_desc:0 "Selective breeding has been helpful so far, but why wait generations when we could speed up evolution ourselves? Our doctors, vets, and handlers have collaborated to make a genetic cocktail that will turn our geckos into the toughest little lizards in the wasteland since the Deathclaw!"
