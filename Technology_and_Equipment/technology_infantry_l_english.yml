 # Infantry Training
 #----------------------------
  unit_training_tech_1:0 "Warrior Training"
  unit_training_tech_1_desc:0 "A basic restructuring of our training program to focus on stress resistance courses, and continuous squad bonding drills. This allows us to root out undisciplined soldiers early, along with those too frail mentally to withstand the rigour of combat, decreasing training time."
  unit_training_tech_2:0 "Militia Training"
  unit_training_tech_2_desc:0 "Military drills aimed at basic defensive operations are carried out across our army. The cornerstone of it is teaching our troops basic guerilla tactics, proper skirmishing procedures as well as field fortification building."
  unit_training_tech_3:0 "Guerilla Tactics"
  unit_training_tech_3_desc:0 "A deeper understanding of guerrilla tactics, and wasteland operation training given by experienced survivalists, let our army strike in unexpected places, as well as take advantage of the rocky terrain or sandstorms."
  unit_training_tech_4:0 "Platoon Training"
  unit_training_tech_4_desc:0 "Officer training and platoon organization allows our command structures to be simplified when compared to loose militia units. Lieutenants trained in field operation and battlefield thinking will also increase our tactical readiness."
  unit_training_tech_5:0 "Basic Drill"
  unit_training_tech_5_desc:0 "Standardized physical drills, and intense training programs, increases the endurance and resilience of our troops. Pairing this with tactical retreat exercises let our soldiers regroup and reorganize much faster from a failed assault or strategical movement."
  unit_training_tech_6:0 "Mechanized Training"
  unit_training_tech_6_desc:0 "Mechanized combined operations along with general motorization can be used to our advantage. Skirmishing troops in light motorized vehicles can quickly engage and tie-up enemy assets, allowing our forces to reinforce ongoing assaults faster."
  unit_training_tech_7:0 "Objective Security Tactics"
  unit_training_tech_7_desc:0 "Massive distribution of entrenching spades is carried out to all soldiers in our army. Combined with specialist shock training dealing with rapid area securing, and squad-level sweep tactics, this allows our troops to quickly secure and reinforce positions."
  unit_training_tech_8:0 "Virtual Reality Training"
  unit_training_tech_8_desc:0 "Pre-war training pods, loaded with all previous improvements to our army drills, let our troops become experienced soldiers much quicker with less ressources directed toward boot camps."

  heavy_infantry_tech_1:0 "Enforcers"
  heavy_infantry_tech_1_desc:0 "While not nearly as sophisticated as special forces equipment, or as advanced as power armour, these pieces of metal and padding strapped to one's body do still help in some situations. Especially useful in its intended role to suppress resistance."
  heavy_infantry_tech_2:0 "Additional Plating"
  heavy_infantry_tech_2_desc:0 "Reinforcing the natural weak spots discovered in our Enforcer's armor with additional armor plating, as well as providing them with purpose-built military helmets instead of their scavenged equipment, should make them much more resistant to small-arms fire. While it will slow them down further, few of them would turn down the opportunity to resist a rifle cartridge to the skull."
  heavy_infantry_tech_3:0 "CqC Training"
  heavy_infantry_tech_3_desc:0 "Now that we have acquired experience in the use of our Enforcers, we can begin developping a uniform, specialized operational doctrine which would vastly increase their effectiveness in close-quarter combat. Better hand-to-hand training alongside squad suppression techniques go a long way in making them more effective on the field."
  heavy_infantry_tech_4:0 "Riot Control Gear"
  heavy_infantry_tech_4_desc:0 "While not nearly as sophisticated as special forces equipment, or as advanced as power armour, these pieces of metal pre-war riot equipment allow our troops to effectively deal with hostile insurgencies."
  heavy_infantry_tech_5:0 "Smoke Grenades"
  heavy_infantry_tech_5_desc:0 "With our Enforcers now seasoned in both civilian and military duties, it is clear that a robust equipment offering ought to follow. The addition of carefully designed pairs of smoke canisters, one tailored to crowd control and the other to acting as a screening device, would do wonders for their capacity to handle insurrectionists and ranged opponents alike."

  warrior_melee_tech:0 "Simplified Designs"
  warrior_melee_tech_desc:0 "The simplified designs of many melee weapons means that many of our soldiers will have an easier time operating without a direct supply line as their gear is light and they don't require as much ammunition and equipment as the average soldier would."
  overcharged_ammunition:0 "Overcharged Ammunition"
  overcharged_ammunition_desc:0 "By having our manufacturers supercharge our MFCs, ECPs and ECs before shipping them our to our troops we can ensure that our energy weapons pack a greater punch without needing to directly modify the weapon at all."
  custom_built_capacitors:0 "Custom Built Capacitors"
  custom_built_capacitors_desc:0 "By custom building our capacitors we can regulate the energy throughput of our weapons and ensure that the blasts are as powerful as we desire, undaunted by the factory limitations of the original manufacturer's blueprints. "
