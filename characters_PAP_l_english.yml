  BAT_FARDEEN_GUERRERO_DESC:0 "Who can forget the man himself, the so-called Prince Albert of Saskatchewan? Once the son of a prominent admiral from Dawfin, he is now nothing more than a defector, a traitor, a liar-- a myth to all those from the good Kingdom of the east. In Battleford he rules over a winterized waste, raiding both the Electors and the Stampede alike in search of his fortune."
