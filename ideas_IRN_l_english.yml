  irn_ironknights:0 "Forged in Flame"
  irn_ironknights_desc:0 "Before they bore banners or barter, the Iron Alliance was a band of exiles and broken things—wanderers, forge-priests, and mercenaries led by a warrior called the Bulleteater. A Comanche by birth, he had abandoned the old ways, seeking not prophecy, but a place where he could forge his own legend. That path led them to New Sterling, where the bones of a ruined Acme Forge still smoldered with latent heat.\nThe city was fractured then, torn between tribes calling themselves the Iron Arrows. They tried to kill the newcomers. Their arrows snapped against the Bulleteater’s salvaged armor, and their pride buckled with them. In fire and blood, he took their city—and gave them purpose. The forge blazed to life once more, and with it came the Alliance.\nThe Iron Alliance is no tribe. It is a creed—of fire, muscle, and muses. Its people believe strength must be earned, not inherited; that power is best wielded by the one who shaped it; and that armor is not merely worn, but bonded with. They trade in war, worship in soot, and dream of a future built not on ruins, but on what can still be made anew."

  irn_mercenaries_desc:0 "The Iron Cult teaches that in the moment of nuclear fire, the Disjunction tore open the veil between worlds—and through that wound came spirits with no flesh of their own. These muses, alien and ancient, slipped into the bones of machines.\nThey dwell now in rusted servers and worn-down rifles, whispering to those who shape steel with reverence. To the Iron Alliance, the forge is sacred, and every weapon carries a soul that remembers what it was made for."

  irn_ironthrone_desc:0 "The Iron Throne is no mere symbol of status. Our growing hold over Colorado places us second to no man."

  irn_ironcrown:0 "The Iron Crown"
  irn_ironcrown_desc:0 "We were once considered bandits, nothing more than annoying raiders to be swatted away. No man east of Shady Sands would dare slander us now. Our proud kingdom is made solely of iron - iron will, iron armor, and a steadfast iron heart."
