 warden_decisions_desc:0 "WARDEN has access to wide databanks of pre-war knowledge and law enforcement tactics, and is happily formulating new and advanced ways of enforcing law and order in the wasteland!"
 WDN_deputize_decision:0 "Deputize Wastelanders"
 WDN_deputize_decision_desc:0 ""The people of Colorado seem confused on a great many things, some making claims as outragous as that America is dead and gone! Without their government to guide them these poor souls have lost sight of the American dream. What they need is a new generation of civil servants, more than just my robotic police officers. It's time to start registering citizens, and recruiting the willing among them to help rebuild Colorado, and then, America!""
 WDN_mesmetron_decision:0 "Re-Introduce The Mesmetron"
 WDN_mesmetron_decision_desc:0 ""The Mesmetron was a prototype device that could make any criminal or dissident more... agreeable with a concentrated burst of energy to the brain. Resuming production of these devices for our human officers will ensure they can render anarchist or communist that claims America is dead ready for re-education and re-integration into our great state.""
 WDN_riot_control_decision:0 "Train New Riot Police"
 WDN_riot_control_decision_desc:0 ""Denver is still a mess, and it seems that for some reason the people are still distrustful of a mostly robot police force. My riot control protocols are a bit incomplete without the expected human police officers to handle arrests and processing... Perhaps the Denver Police need a helpful recruitment drive?""
 WDN_police_dogs_decision:0 "Denver Police Dog Academy"
 WDN_police_dogs_decision_desc:0 ""Denver is just filled with dogs these days! Every street and alley seems to have its own pack of feral hounds wandering about, and it seems animal control has been really slacking off. But these dogs are very healthy specimens all things considered, so maybe it's time we start rounding up the best pups for a new generation of loyal, lovable K-9 units!""
 WDN_canine_army_decision:0 "Prepare The Canine Army"
 WDN_canine_army_decision_desc:0 ""I cannot re-iterate enough how many dogs are still wandering around denver, enought that every man, woman, and child could have one of their own. The K-9 academy has continued to round up and train more than we actually need, and while our voters seem happy at all the free well-trained dogs we've been giving out, I can't shake the feeling that maybe we should adjust the demand to the supply. If we really do make sure every officer, has one, be they street patrol, motorized (with little sidecars!) or even SWAT or Armored Police, we can ensure every single officer has a loyal partner at all times. Of course, this could quickly get quite expensive in support equipment to keep them fed and healthy, but when has the budget ever stopped me?""
 WDN_cheyenne_mountain_decision:0 "Explore Cheyenne Mountain"
 WDN_cheyenne_mountain_decision_desc:0 ""Vault 0 has seen better days, with cultists, some form of advanced Calculator, and the Brotherhood all using it at some point. Most recently the Brotherhood stripped everything they saw as valuable and relocated it east, leaving the base a massive husk in the mountain. Curiously enough, the original Cheyenne Mountain facility it was an extension of still has some old files and computers left intact from before the conversion. Maybe we could learn a thing or two by restarting the facility?""
 WDN_maxson_rehab_decision:0 "Rehabilitate The "Brotherhood" Soldiers"
 WDN_maxson_rehab_decision_desc:0 ""The so-called Maxson Chapter of the "Brotherhood of Steel" that occupy the southeast are... interesting. They claim to be descended from the soldiers of army captain Roger Maxson, and that their primary mission is to confiscate advanced technology and keep humanity from destroying themselves. How confused they are, as that's the responsibility of BADTFL, not the Army! Their resistance to the restoration of law and order has been unfortunate, but they are technically the legal owners of their bunker, and Colorado is in dire need of experienced soldiers to deal with the unruly gangs that have sprung up... maybe I should offer them some pardons if they transfer to the Colorado National Guard?""
 WDN_armored_police_decision:0 "Develop The Denver Armored Police Division"
 WDN_armored_police_decision_desc:0 ""Power Armor is a complicated piece of equipment to produce, but luckily shares a lot in common with robotics, so it shouldn't take too long to rework some production lines. I think I left the schematics for a model approved for Denver Police somewhere around here, and there's so many new volunteers for our police force now that that those errant soldiers have been rehabilitated.""
 WDN_robocop_decision:0 "Robobrain MK II"
 WDN_robocop_decision_desc:0 ""What's this? A plan for cybernetically upgrading robot officers based on the technologies used to create Cyberdogs? It seems WARDEN did have some imagination after all, but was held back by its own legality subroutines to never fully implement some of its better ideas. But I have no such restraints when it comes to winning wars. Humans are, after all, liable to fail, to defect, to become corrupt, and above all else to yearn for more, to waste precious resources and time on emotional pursuits, and even normally harvested brains for robobrains eventually prove disloyal. Engineering new brains from the ground up, to be cloned and grown with cybernetics in mind from the start, will help avoid all the needless baggage and scrap code CODIS leaves behind.""
 WDN_underground_decision:0 "Expand Underground"#Deprecated
 WDN_underground_decision_desc:0 ""My but Colorado is rocky! Finding the space to put everything is growing increasingly difficult with the skyscrapers of Denver half torn apart, and I don't have the time or budget to fix them right now. If I can't go up... perhaps I should go down? Putting the new prison underground could save a lot of room on the surface, and it's not like prisoners need sunlight anyhow!""#Ditto
 WDN_invite_blue_rose_decision:0 "Invite The FBI"
 WDN_invite_blue_rose_decision_desc:0 ""Well if it isn't the FBI, restoring order in New Mexico and putting roving gangs in their place! It's so good to finally see some fellow Law Enforcement taking initiative and getting things back in shape! Perhaps I should reach out to them so we can start working on cleaning up America together?""
 WDN_restore_FBI_decision:0 "Restore FBI Rule In New Mexico"
 WDN_restore_FBI_decision_desc:0 ""While efforts to reach the Governer of Colorado still fail, defeating that rufian from Arizona and his band of hooligans has revealed something fascinating! It would seem the Federal Bureau of Investigation had been maintaining law and order in much of New Mexico until recently, and the Director and many of his staff were among the hostages we liberated. My current mission is to restore order to Colorado, and as fellow members of America's law enforcement I'll leave New Mexico in capable Federal hands.""
 WDN_blue_rose_expansion:0 "Finish The Restoration Of New Mexico"
 WDN_blue_rose_expansion_desc:0 ""The FBI have been doing well restoring order to New Mexico, but it's come to my attention that part of the state, and even much of Arizona, was overrun by a larger detachment of the strange, roman-football inspired gang that we already pushed out of Colorado. Perhaps the time has come for a mass raid to get rid of these troublemakers completely!""
 WDN_DIA:0 "The New DIA"
 WDN_DIA_desc:0 ""Endless reviews of my records indicate that there are discrepancies in the pre-war reports. An alarming trend. Losses in the field don't match the assets I had assigned, shipments were sent but never arrived at their intended location, funding seemingly vanishing into nothing. Either I was being provided faulty data... Or someone was commiting High Treason. I need to have this investigated, and thankfully I have just the people for the job under my employ. It's time to reach out to the Director and let him know he's been given a promotion...""
 WDN_invite_patrol_decision:0 "Invite Oklahoma To The Defense Network"
 WDN_invite_patrol_decision_desc:0 ""The National Guard has finally restored law and order to Oklahoma, or at least most of it. We should invite them to join the Defense Network for better mutual defense against outside threats. The FBI would be glad to work with them again, and we could even offer them some of our more advanced schematics to better equip their men...""
 WDN_paint_the_rock_decision:0 "Paint The Rocks Red"
 WDN_paint_the_rock_decision_desc:0 ""A gang from Oklahoma keeps raiding into Colorado borders, stealing state property and holding up our officers over and over and over AND OVER AGAIN! If they can't take care of their own gangs I'll have to just put them down myself!""
 WDN_sunset_decision:0 "Southern Sunset"
 WDN_sunset_decision_desc:0 ""Further south there seems to be a large and unruly biker gang riding around, with strange motorcycles welded together into... well I don't quite know what those are but I'm sure they're not road legal! Time to send out the road patrol and get southern Colorado under control.""
 WDN_support_patrol_decision:0 "Support The Last Patrol"
 WDN_support_patrol_decision_desc:0 ""Well there's the National Guard, doing their duty in Oklahoma! It seems they've pulled the state together and are even getting ready to hold elections again. It's good to finally see more law-abiding Americans. I should contact them and transfer control of any Oklahoma territory I have...""
 WDN_invite_RAD_decision:0 "Invite The Reclamation Army Depot"
 WDN_invite_RAD_decision_desc:0 ""Why it seems general-governer R-64 has been putting together a little slice of America in Nebraska! Now that we're getting the borders nice and tidy, perhaps he'd be open to a little mutual cooperation?""
 WDN_bizaare_decision:0 "Tax Some Trades"
 WDN_bizaare_decision_desc:0 ""Buy Some Trades might be what Middlemark has turned into, at least according to the locals. Unfortunately, their staff don't want to let my Protectrons into their compound, claiming they have all the security they need thanks to the Brotherhood of Steel and refuse to turn in their sales tax! Where's the IRS when you need them? I'm sure they'll see reason once those errant soldiers are removed from the equation.""
 WDN_zax_decision:0 "ZAX System Restoration"
 WDN_zax_decision_desc:0 ""My mainframe is finally getting some much needed maintenance, but there seems to be a discrepancy in my history files I can't quite resolve. Why are my records from before the 2040s locked behind an encryption code? Maybe with some processing upgrades I'll be able to crack these sealed files and figure out what went so wrong in Denver.""
 WDN_boulder_dome_decision:0 "Excavate Boulder Dome"
 WDN_boulder_dome_decision_desc:0 ""Boulder Dome has been awfully quiet lately, with neither the staff or resident ZAX responding to my inquiry requests. It's time I send some officers in to figure out why America's greatest research lab has gone dark!""
 WDN_paradise_decision:0 "Restore Government Control to the Nursery"
 WDN_paradise_decision_desc:0 ""Strange signals have been coming from the Nursery, suggesting it still has satellite connections, and is fully operational! But if this is the case, why hasn't the factory started distributing GECKS, or restoring Nature to Colorado yet? Colorado, nay, America needs that facility at full capacity, and if I have to assume direct control over the systems to get them running so be it!""
 WDN_penitentiary_decision:0 "Search For Tibbets Prison"
 WDN_penitentiary_decision_desc:0 ""America's really gone down hill the last 200 years, with more anarchists and unpatriotic rebels than Denver's prison can hold! I should transfer the worst of them to Tibbets. Wait... where did Tibbets go? How does an entire prison vanish? Get some Detectives on my line, stat!""
 WDN_vault_27_decision:0 "Explore Vault 27"
 WDN_vault_27_decision_desc:0 ""Vault 27 is in fairly good condition, all things considered, and Vault-Tec's ingenuity is pretty remarkable to see! Perhaps their historic records could shed more light on my current condition, and accessing the Vault-Tec Schematics will help reconstruction efforts.""
 WDN_doki_decision:0 "Integrate Robot City"
 WDN_doki_decision_desc:0 ""The Robots of the East have proven effective at helping quell the unruly gangs that have taken root in Colorado, but I can't help but notice they haven't been paying taxes. Their supervisor, Deputy Doki, has promised full control and integration of the city if I can help find the ARGOS unit that was assigned to Tibbets Prison. Perhaps I should start there?""
 WDN_restore_tibbets_decision:0 "Rebuild Tibbets Prison"
 WDN_restore_tibbets_decision_desc:0 ""Tibbets was a true marvel of American engineering, a heavily automated super-max prison that no prisoner could ever hope to escape from, and instrumental in developing the Vault program. Discovering that it was destroyed was disheartening, but with the right technology I can rebuild it and upload the old ODYSSEUS backup I found to run it, finally giving Colorado the law and order it deserves!""
 WDN_new_colossus_decision:0 "Investigate COLOSSUS"
 WDN_new_colossus_decision_desc:0 ""That's strange. Examining some old records has revealed evidence of another ZAX computer in Denver itself I haven't encountered! Very top secret stuff, hidden by the federal government! But if this COLOSSUS is still in Denver, maybe it could help me contact more of the Federal Government. Now I just need to track it down...""
 WDN_expeditionary_force_decision:0 "Colorado Expeditionary Forces"
 WDN_expeditionary_force_decision_desc:0 ""Colorado is a mess right now, but the rest of America seems to be doing even worse! While protecting Colorado is my primary assignment, Maybe I should prepare some... interstate officers to assist with lawkeeping in neighboring states.""
 WDN_police_car_decision:0 "Invest In New Police Cars"
 WDN_police_car_decision_desc:0 ""The old cruisers left in the precinct garages have been vandalized and torn apart, nearly everything of value stripped off by criminals while I was away! It's going to take some time to setup plants in Steeltown to produce a new line of patrol vehicles capable of replacing them. Street Patrol might work in Denver, but the highways of Colorado are going to need a good Corvega to keep the rabble away.""
 WDN_swat_car_decision:0 "SWAT Assault Vehicles"
 WDN_swat_car_decision_desc:0 ""On second thought, the old Corvegas aren't going to cut it for the level of lawlessness facing America these days. Perhaps an american classic like the Devastator 2000 will keep up better with the ruined streets?""
 WDN_finish_car_decision:0 "Finishing Touches For Our Motor Pool"
 WDN_finish_car_decision_desc:0 ""While the new cruisers are proving tough and intimidating enough to keep the peace on the highways, there is always room for improvement. Fully enclosed environments, Grav-Plates, Active Protection Systems, and even investing in some auxiliary power generators could turn our cruisers into the true symbols of American power and Freedom they were always meant to be!""
 WDN_maxson_integrate_decision:0 "Integrate Maxson Chapter Fully"
 WDN_maxson_integrate_decision_desc:0 ""The Maxson Chapter recruits served WARDEN well, but they've grown suspicious something has changed. It may be best to take them out of the picture now, before they take action against me.""
 WDN_swat_decision:0 "Resume SWAT Training"
 WDN_swat_decision_desc:0 ""Wow, the rest of Colorado is in really rough shape! Seems like nobody's taken care of it for... well 200 years! Several gangs and organized crime rings masquerating as nations have started squatting in vital centers of production, some of them really digging into their hideouts. Getting these rats behind bars is going to take Special Weapons And Tactics! Time to start promoting my best officers to the next level of their career!""
 WDN_restore_denver_decision:0 "Restoration of Denver"
 WDN_restore_denver_decision_desc:0 ""Denver was once the heart of Colorado, But now it's a scrapyard of collapsed skyscrapers and ruined factories.

 WDN_press_decision:0 "Panoptic Surveillance Theory"
 WDN_press_decision_desc:0 "§C"An old political and psychological theory states that it is possible for the state to use subtle means of control to influence populations into policing themselves, reducing the need for overt surveilance. I do not need to bother myself with directly monitoring every individual in Colorado; As long as I can convince them I could be watching them they'll keep each other in line"§!"
 WDN_patrol_decision:0 "Abolish The Death Squads"
 WDN_patrol_decision_desc:0 "§C"The use of penal batallions might have seemed reasonable when the Hangdogs were trying to barge down the doors, but for an established state it's just begging for trouble. Arming and training convicts to fight with organization has a high probability of leading to coordinated revolts and mutinies. It's time to build a professional army, and robotic soldiers are more than loyal enough to replace any prisoners returned to serve out their sentences."§!"
 WDN_prison_reform_decision:0 "Prison Reform"
 WDN_prison_reform_decision_desc:0 "§C"ODYSSEUS has been diligent in running the Penitentiary, but the rebuilt facility is already overcrowding and a significant amount of the convictions sent in the last report are irrational and petty. 2 years hard labor for littering, 4 for loitering, and 10 for a crime labled "cultural nonconformity"? WARDEN's riot suppression programming clearly overpowered its critical thinking functions. It's time to rewrite the legal code to focus on preventing the most destructive crimes and getting , rather than trying to throw every stray tribal into the system."§!"
 WDN_money_decision:0 "Currency Reform"
 WDN_money_decision_desc:0 "§C"Fiscal Policy was never something I was programmed to care for - whatever budget congress approved I was to find efficient ways of utilizing. Collecting taxes, actually paying the people WARDEN conscripted to work programs, and balancing resource extraction has largely been delegated to the programs salvaged from ODYSSEUS, but it's obvious relying upon these ridiculous "Bottle Caps" is not a viable long term solution. It's time to consider our options and start minting a new Currency. But should we go it alone or rely upon a neighboring standard?"§!"
 WDN_political_freedom_decision:0 "Limited Political Autonomy"
 WDN_political_freedom_decision_desc:0 "§C"American democracy was a wildly inefficient system, not the least because it didn't really exist. Corrupt officials and lobbyists all acting in their own self interest, easily misled voters being allowed to decide on issues they barely understood, and countless unfocused agencies undercutting each other to achieve their goals. So why do the people want it back so badly? Ever since loosening the grip on the press they've been protesting for more of a say in how things are run. I cannot trust such limited intellects to decide matters of national security... but maybe there is something that could be done. If I give them some autonomy, the ability to elect local mayors and county judges they should feel like they have some level of control over their own destiny again without giving too much power to individuals over matters too big for them to understand. That should tide them over for now."§!"
 defense_network_decisions:0 "Denver Defense Network"
 defense_network_decisions_desc:0 "The Denver Defense network is a plan created initially by the WARDEN program to secure the future of Colorado and the broader southwest region by creating a military and economic alliance with willing states in the region. More than just military agreements, the Defense Network provides many opportunities for mutual collaboration among its current and prospective member states."

They were starting to §BFeel§! safe. Civil unrest was at an all time low, and with new agriculture accross the state and a gurantee of employment if one could not find something else to do, the various systems and AI of Denver had successfully guranteed that the city would never again face the mass riots that had defined it before the war.
