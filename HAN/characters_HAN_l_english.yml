  HAN_crbs_desc:0 "§C"CRB-S is one of a few elite prototypes for advanced robot dogs from the Denver City Police Department, built to help contain riots before the war. Nowadays Denver has more than enough normal dogs running about, but CRB-S is smart enough to lead entire packs as though it was one of them. Such a good dog, and so loyal...."§!"

  HAN_medicine:0 "§GMaria Greene§!"
  HAN_medicine_desc:0 "§G"The outbreak of New Plague and many industrial troubles left a surprising trove of medical supplies in Denver. While food was short before and after the war, cure alls and vaccines were in high supply. Nearly 200 years later, the reduced population and glut of medical literature has left Hangdog territory one of the healthiest places in the wastes."§!"

  HAN_henson:0 "§YBryce Henson§!"
  HAN_henson_desc:0 "§Y"Some of the outliers of the Hangdogs tend to take their reverence of animals too far. Some of them establish totems or other strange habits, but Henson perhaps takes the cake. Eating only kibble and some of the scraps he feeds his war hounds, he claims that he is no better than the beasts he fights with. Disgusting to say the least, but his warband has never gone hungry."§!"
  HAN_booth:0 "§YChadwick Booth§!"
  HAN_booth_desc:0 "§Y\"When we stopped the raids, we lost our edge. The Hangdogs used to be the bane of Colorado. The ghouls of the North and the fake hounds to the south should be quivering in fear. Show me you haven't lost your bite.\"§!"
  HAN_rex:0 "§GRex§!"
  HAN_rex_desc:0 "§G"First, he hates rats. Can't stand the things. Giant rats, molerats, doesn't matter. He catches a whiff of one and he's off like a shot after them. He's normally pretty obedient, but you might have to chase him some if he goes after one of the little varmints. Second, he doesn't like hats, or the people wearing them. Don't ask. I have no idea why. Maybe because it rhymes with rats."§!"
  HAN_caravan:0 "§GCaravan Master Byrne§!"
  HAN_caravan_desc:0 "§G"Trade is life in the wasteland. While many of the Brahmin barons and water merchants of the west just wish to live life as fat as possible, Byrne sees it as a stepping stone. Controlling the flow of resources, news, and travel in and out of an area, the Wasteland is just an impressive chessgame for him."§!"

  HAN_bomb:0 "§CLockreed Stargazer Uplinks§!"
  HAN_bomb_desc:0 "§C"Most satellites have de-orbited, but parts of Lockreed's strategic guidance constellation still flicker in the skies. A humble branch office in Denver still has the hardware to communicate, all it needs is the right password and new targets to stalk."§!"

  HAN_howler_desc:0 "§Y"Most of the tribal and raider elements of the Hangdogs have been purged, but some remains around the edges.

  HAN_powergrid:0 "§CGDA Fusion Power Grid§!"
  HAN_powergrid_desc:0 "§C"Towering over the plains, without proper context the wind turbines look like strange idols to some long forgotten culture. With proper oversight however, the blades can turn on and the power will flow through the wastes."§!"
  HAN_plains:0 "§YPlainswalker Adonai§!"
  HAN_plains_desc:0 "§Y"Colorado wasn't known for its infrastructure before the war, but little is left after the bombs dropped. Crossing great distances to scavenge for food and resources, the Plainswalkers are one of the last tribes to not be fully integrated into the Hangdogs. Led by Adonai, they heed the will of Bares His Teeth to rule the plains of Colorado."§!"
  HAN_bodhi:0 "§YBodhi of Castle Rock§!"
  HAN_bodhi_desc:0 "§Y"Many think the Hangdogs only tribal savages, but Bodhi comes from the gentler side of the tribe. A Clan Mother, she tends to the young and strives to raise the pups to be strong and healthy, instilling in them a sense of camaraderie and loyalty to their Packmates"§!"
  HAN_dome:0 "§CGreene Custom Defense Dome #54§!"

  HAN_grand_advisor:0 "§YTributary Watcher§!"
  HAN_grand_advisor_desc:0 "§Y"The Arkansas Tributary serves as a natural border into Hangdogs territory.

  HAN_lupa:0 "§GLupa Capitolina§!"
