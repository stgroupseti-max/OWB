  HAI_CHIEF_XHUUYAA_NAME:0 "Chief Xhuuyaa"  
  HAI_CHIEF_XHUUYAA_DESC:0 "An orphan child, Chief Xhuuyaa never knew his true parents. Instead, Xhuuyaa was raised by the village community he was born into and was thus brough up by those of the Eagle and of the Raven alike. While traditionally a child inherits the moiety of their mother, Xhuuyaa's mother's moiety was unknown, and so the village elders decided Xhuuyaa should live without a moiety, drawing inspiration from both the Eagle and the Raven in equal measure. As a result, Xhuuyaa stood through his young adulthood as a symbol of unity and strength for the Haida people: a natural choice for Chief."
