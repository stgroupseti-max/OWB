  BRK_GRAVEN_NAME:0 "Graven"
  BRK_GRAVEN_WW_NAME:0 "King K. Kraven"
  BRK_GRAVEN_DESC:0 "Clad in old world armour from the far north, Graven is a mystery to all. His past is unknown, his face is glimpsed by few, and his burns have no known origin. When he was young he was savage, thirsty for power, but now his bloodlust has matured into something more sinister. With age comes wisdom, or so they say: for Graven, with age came insanity."
  BRK_RAGNAR_NAME:0 "Ragnar"
  BRK_RAGNAR_DESC:0 "Son of the Frost—that's what they call Ragnar. Legends speak of his birth, the child of a dead man and a frost giant from the Endless White. Supposedly only the Frozen Cabal knows the true story. Regardless of myth, Ragnar's might is clear to see, he stands taller and broader than any other man along the coast. He lives and breathes \"Survival of the Fittest\". Seven foot tall and seemingly invincible, Ragnar's thirst for battle is only matched by his inhuman strength."
  BRK_BRUTE_THE_BRUTE_NAME:0 "Brute the Brute"
  BRK_GILBERT_BOLTON_NAME:0 "Gilbert Bolton"
