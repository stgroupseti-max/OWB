  LAP_RUNNING_BEAR_DESC:0 "Running Bear earned his name as a boy, when his voice carried across the night, a sharp warning that cut through the wind like a blade. It was said the earth itself paused to listen. Now, his voice carries the weight of prophecy, hoarse from decades of defiance yet unbroken. He has outlasted treaties, raids, and the silver-tongued men who promise peace while carrying shackles. Their words fall like stones against his resolve—worn but unyielding, carved by years of loss and bloodshed.\n\nThe Ghost Dance has become the marrow of Running Bear's spirit. He believes, with the quiet fervor of the desperate and the devout, that the land remembers the old ways. They will dance the world into rebirth—shake loose the mines, the fences, the stink of factories. He sees it clearly in his mind’s eye: the earth rolling back on itself, swallowing the scars left behind, the hills rising proud once more. Each stomp, each song, brings them closer. The Black Hills call to him in dreams, their whispers woven into the hum of the dance. Even if he does not live to see that day, Running Bear will keep his people moving, their feet against the dirt, until the world begins to tremble."
