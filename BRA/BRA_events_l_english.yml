  nf_bra.0.title:0 "The Dark Ages"
  nf_bra.0.desc:0 "Long before the time of kings and republics and in the radioactive winter of the Great War when the craters still burned with atomic fire, there were the people of Manitoba. These people, broken by the American invasion, and reeling from the very death of the world, had lost everything. And when one loses all they have, they seek to take what others possess. What power the red fighters of the Canadian People's Front had once held in the province was quickly taken by the now desperate and deadly locals, forcing them westward. It was then that the Dark Ages began.\n\nManitoba descended into decades of violence. Where there had once been neighbours, now stood rival gangs, fighting each other in an eternal struggle for survival. Those who lacked the will or proved too weak found themselves the victims of stronger warlords and warbands. For fifty years, the land stood divided, until one day, one warlord would stake his claim. The man known only as Gunn, who had claimed the city of Winnipeg from what remained of the Red Menace, would do what no communist or raider had done since the Great War.\n\nFrom his seat of power, Gunn would expand his domain, not through violence, but rather, diplomacy. The first to submit were the masters of Brandon, whose submission granted them the honour of dukedom, and with it, the Warlord of Brandon would become heir to the King of Manitoba. Many would submit and in turn earn the privilege of nobility in the new Kingdom as duchies, each one offering something to strengthen the new realm. Of these gifts, the King showed the most favour to was..."

  nf_bra.1.title:0 "A Kingdom Ascendent and Age of Decline"
  nf_bra.1.desc:0 "And so the Age of the Kingdom began. King Gunn expanded the Kingdom for many years, before vanishing into the frozen wastes, leaving the Kingdom to his heir. Many decades would pass with different kings from the Brandon line claiming the throne, some mighty and honourable, such as Brandon IV, and some weak willed and shameful, such as the Mad Brandon V. It would be during this age that the Kingdom reached its greatest height, stretching from the Duchy of Langenburg, to the Royal Crownlands, and to the Duchy of Angers. The Kingdom was strong, proud, and a force to be respected. All was good in the lands of Manitoba.\n\nYet, it was not to be. As the Age of the Kingdom ended, the Age of Decline would begin. The kings grew weak and complacent, the nobility scheming and self-serving, and many a peasant revolt occurred. Cruel Kings such as Brandon VI had short reigns marred by blood and strife. Despite all the signs, the Kingdom was blind to the crisis that was bubbling underneath its very feet, too busy discussing the latest trends or the planning of the next royal feast. That was, until the bubble burst.\n\nThe War of the First Republican Coalition marked the end of the Age of Decline, and ushered in the current age. The rebellious Three Rivers Republic and Métis Congress marched against the Kingdom, intent on destroying all that it held dear. In their greatest moment of arrogance, the last king of Gunn's line, Brandon VIII, marched against Republican forces during the Battle of Stonewall, and was slaughtered. If not for the actions of Count Yorkton of Langenburg in destroying the Métis army, many believe the Kingdom would have fallen. As a hasty peace was signed, hundreds fled from the Republican horde, bringing with them..."

  nf_bra.2.title:0 "The Age of Division"
  nf_bra.2.desc:0 "With the death of King Brandon IX, himself leaving no heir, the lineage of Brandon had been decimated. The Kingdom maintained its authority through a quickly assembled Regency Council, but a monarchy without a king left them with no legitimacy. Desperate for somebody to take up the reins, they searched for a chosen successor who could lead them away from the humiliation they had suffered. \n\nAnd thus Gunn II was selected to lead the broken empire. Quiet and methodical yet highly radical in his beliefs, he was a stark contrast from the brash and bold lineage of the Brandons, one which much of the elite of Manitoba look down upon; including the Lion of Langenburg, Leif Yorkton. Rumors spread of Gunn's inability to lead, that the council chose him simply to use as a puppet of the elite. Externally, Manitoba's previous enemies watch; smelling blood in the water. And yet the greatest threat to Gunn is himself. His mind decays daily, time continuing to chip at his sanity. \n\nDespite all this, he continues to push forward. Preparing himself for the troublesome times that lay ahead. Already he has begun to make drastic changes to the Kingdom, one of the most important being..."

  nf_bra.3.title:0 "The Dying Immortal"
  nf_bra.3.desc:0 "King Gunn II could feel his age. Not physically, the old ghoul had gotten used to the pain that came with his condition for centuries now, but in his failing mind. In the past, he had dreaded his dreams, haunted by the specter of Manitoba's past mistakes and failed conquests. Now, he wishes nothing more but to have them back. Everything, even the constant torment of his ever-working consciousness, was preferable to the blackness that now accompanied his nights. It was as if he threatened to drown in an ocean of pitch black tar everytime he closed his eyes.\n\nThe first time it happened, even before he was known as Gunn II, he had just tried to scream, shaking his despondent body, trying to get himself to wake up, but nothing seemed to work. He just kept existing and not existing as darkness seemed to flow through him. He awoke one morning, alone in an expensively decorated room in the palace, to find his bedroom torn to pieces, expensive looking fabric tossed carelessly on to the ground. He had heard stories of normal ghouls turning into feral, mindless monsters, roaming the irradiated planes in the single minded pursuit of living tissue as if it could bring them back from the terrible fate they had suffered. He had never considered the possibility that they all could have been once like him.\n\nFrom that night on, King Gunn II forbade anyone, including his wife, Queen Katherine, from entering his personal chambers. His sentries were under strict orders to keep the heavy oak door locked no matter what they might hear. Only a single member of his royal advisors knew of his condition, that being none other than William Tanner. Should it come down to it, King Gunn II commanded Tanner to prevent harm from coming to those around him, even at the cost of the old ghoul's life. However, these precautions did little to ease the growing fear and dread in the King's heart that one day he would never awaken from the darkness."

  nf_bra.4.desc:0 "The ball was the event of the year and the Queen proved herself again as nothing less than a most gracious host. However, the glimmering palace and lavish decorations could not distract from the suspicious absence of her husband. Nonetheless, the ball continued on even as the rumors of the King's illness spread around the room. That was until the absolute highlight of the evening surpassed even the immaculate food and wonderful music, which was the always-entertaining dispute between the Duck Mountaineer and a group of Manitoban aristocrats.\n\nIt is no secret that they got along like oil and water, but it seemed the absence of the king and the abundance of alcohol had allowed their heated argument to almost break out into an actual brawl. To the delight of everyone but the queen, the two parties moved on from thinly veiled insults to poorly hidden threats to outright calls for violence. There was little doubt that the aristocrats would be no match for the considerably larger Mountie, whose muscles were a result of a life of backbreaking labor.\n\nThe first bets were already being placed when the surprising arrival of the King put a stop to the matter entirely, his cold gaze immediately assessing the situation that threatened to unfold before his eyes as he sternly called both of them to order. The King reprimanding his nobles in front of all the guests, like a school teacher scolding his pupils, was met with considerable joy by the other attendants who relished this rare opportunity of seeing their social betters cast down for once. After finishing his improvised speech, Gunn II returned to his wife's side before apologizing to the guests for his delayed arrival, without giving any definitive answer as to what could have kept him."

  nf_bra.5.title:0 "The King's Guard Dog"
  nf_bra.5.desc:0 "William Tanner is living proof that meritocratic principles are alive and well under the protective umbrella of the monarchy. Although he was first brought into service of the crown for his exceptional skill in handling animals, he quickly rose from the humble rank of Beastmaster and Duck Mountaineer to head of the Mounties and trusted advisor in all matters regarding the royal menagerie.\n\nHowever, Tanner's true heroism does not stem from his raw skill. Rather, it comes from his dedication to protecting the common Manitoban citizenry. The valiant deeds committed by Tanner during the First War of the Republican Coalition saved countless lives and, according to many, even the Kingdom as a whole. Were it not for him and his Mounties choosing to garrison the frontier territories deemed unimportant by the Manitoban nobility, the surprise naval landing from the Republic of Three Rivers in Riding Mountain would not have been detected and thwarted. Tanner's fierce aura of authority inspired his outmatched force to gather their strength and defend the farms and infrastructure of local settlements from the Republican Army attempting to supply their soldiers planning to cut off Royal forces in Porto Prairie and attack the capital of Brandon from behind.\n\nAfter the Kingdom's defeat and the perceived failure of the Knightly Orders to protect them, the Manitoban nobility chose to disband them, which King Gunn II approved of, later replacing them with the Mounties. Since then, the Mounties have dutifully guarded all under the Kingdom of Manitoba, earning them the unofficial name of the People's Mounties."

At the head of the procession is none other than William Tanner, the King's finest soldier, holding the flag of Manitoba and the Kings Own Duck Mountaineers high as he rides upon his horse, saluting the King's palace as they march past.\n\nKing Gunn himself had retired shortly before the procession reached his residence, stating that he felt unwell.

The palace had been in a constant state of work since the rebellion in Langenburg.\n\nReaching her husband's private quarters, she hesitated before opening the door. Gunn had broken out in rage upon hearing the news of the rebellion, and after its defeat, held a night long victory celebration, still cursing the name of Leif Yorkton. Mustering her courage, she entered the unlit room, spotting her husband standing in front of a mirror.\n\nBefore she could say anything, he spoke to her.\n\n"Why do they fight me, Katherine? Why—after all I have done to lead these people towards some semblance of life from the Old World—do they conspire against me!"\n\nHe slammed a table with his fist. Silence hung in the air as Katherine thought about her response, but her husband spoke with a sigh.\n\n"I guess it matters not in the end. They have been defeated and I am still here. Now, what can I do for you, my dear?"\n\n"I am here to discuss the fate of the Langenburg. I propose that we place Leif's daughter, Eleanor, as the Duchess of their lands.""

Not only is she loyal to you and the Kingdom, but she was devastated by her fathers actions. She believes—as do I—that the people of Langenburg should pay for their crimes against the crown, and she is willing to lead them in this endeavour."\n\nKatherine looked at her husband and through his anger she could see his mind humouring the proposal.\n\nShe spoke again, "placing her in charge will also make the people more compliant, as even after the rebellion, the name Yorkton holds sway over the people. It will ensure that hostilities won't flare up again."\n\nSilence. Katherine held her breath as she waited for her husband to make a decision. Finally, he spoke.\n\n"Is she capable of governing?"\n\n"Yes, she has learnt from myself and our advisors."\n\n"I don't like this, but I will allow it.

The city gathers together in the central square, as the funeral procession of the King arrives for the public farewell. First to arrive is the King's coffin, a simple darkwood casket, draped with his personal seal, and flanked by a squad of the King's Own Duck Mountaineers.\n\nNext is the Queen, Katherine, her normal beauty completely shadowed by grief, as she struggles to hold back tears. Following her, and leading a contingent of Mountaineers, is William Tanner, their commander and the King's most loyal subjects.

Tanner had been by his side, ensuring that the military would remain strong and dedicated to the Kingdom and the monarch who ruled it. Progress has been going well.\n\nYet, it was still not enough. There was more to do, laws to write, edicts sworn in, grants to be given. But Gunn knew his time was running out. His hands shook more and more, his thoughts harder to maintain, the words of those around him more difficult to understand. Even the most clueless member of his court could tell he was degrading before their very eyes, and had begun to whisper more. Tanner and Katherine could see it too, and urged him to measure himself, to rest and preserve his mental strength. Tanner had even put forward the idea to search the frozen wasteland for a cure, lost in old research laboratories and military projects. But could Gunn afford to do that?

Manitoban land was much more decentralized in the old Kingdom and given more autonomy under our duchies and marches; however, this decentralization eventually led to the fall of the Kingdom. Despite this, it might be time to expand the scope of the last duchy, Langenburg.\n\nWhile we are still healing from the wounds of their treachery, it would be a disservice to claim Eleanor Yorkton hasn't remained faithful to the crown and quell our fears of future rebellion. The lands to the west will be transferred to the Duchy of Langenburg for the time being until our republican enemies on our borders are taken care of."

Gunn looked up from his paperwork, annoyed at being disturbed, the extra noise compounding the pain from his headache. Before he could question what Tanner was doing here, he slid a report onto the desk. Gunn began to read it, his eyes widening as he did so.\n\nReports of pre-war facilities, rumours of strange lights and horrible creatures, and old myths of experiments from ages past. Could these places have a cure for him? To think that such places of horrible scientific perversions could be the hope he needed to save himself. Was it worth the risk, when all other options could only serve as momentary reprieves. Gunn turned to Tanner, and authorised expeditions to find these facilities."

Dark stains spread across the walls and floor, pooling around the torn remains of palace servants. Muffled roars and screams echoed throughout the building, the group increasing their pace as they attempted to find its source. Torn flesh and scrapped cloth lined their path, bodies growing fresher the deeper they went. Tanner's hands shook, the blood curdling screams filling his ears, as the smell of death began to choke him. Another roar, this time through the door in front of them.\n\nTanner kicked it open, and the Thing stared at him, turning away from the horrified Queen Katherine. Hunched over, blood dripping from its hands and mouth. Its clothes, once the finests hallmarks of leadership, now reduced to torn and blood stained rags. Its eyes, nothing but madness and anger, devoid of any idea of mercy and love. The Thing that was once King Gunn II roared, lunging towards Tanner like the wild animal he was. Tanner, his mind blank with horror, felt his body move on instinct, saw his rifle rise, and felt it fire. The Thing's head snapped back, its body crumpling into a pile in front of Tanner. Katherine let out a pained wail, collapsing before the body of her husband."

Yet, her tears were not for her departed Gunn, but rather for the Kingdom. As soon as her husband was found to have passed on, the Nobility began to scheme and plot for their own gain. Seeing such disrespect for the decades of work Gunn had put in to protect the Kingdom and its people, even as his body was laid to rest, filled Katherine with such cold loathing that she could no longer speak with them. These people could not be trusted to run the Kingdom. They lacked the compassion of her dear Gunn, his love for the Kingdom and its people, his strength of heart. They always stood in his way, blocking his efforts at every turn. Katherine stroked the ring gently, her fingers brushing the grooves that made up the name.\n\n"They can not be trusted... The Kingdom will suffer..."\n\nDrying her tears, Katherine called for her maidservant. She asked for a pen and paper, and to summon Tanner at once. She looked down once again at the ring in her hand, and read the name one final time. Gunn's true name. She would not let his dream die with him, even though he would not want her to take on this burden. Katherine slid the ring onto her finger, and prepared to ensure that her husband did not die in vain."

His Mountie guards walked behind him, nervously looking around at the fleshy shapes half hidden in the shadows. Their commander, William Tanner, walked beside Gunn, his rifle shaking in his hands.\n\nOne of the figures shifted forward, bringing it into the flickering remains of the facility's lights. Its form was humanoid, yet the rolls of rolling flesh and misshapen features turned Gunn's stomach in revulsion. If his face hadn't been ruined by radiation, it would have become as pale as death. This was a new level of horror, even greater than the American occupiers centuries ago. Yet he did not show this fear, for the King was expected to stand firm in the face of such monstrous adversity.\n\nDespite this, as the group entered the central chamber, even Gunn was unable to hide his shivers at what he saw. A giant chamber, divided into multiple glass boxes, filled with more of those flesh creatures. Strange pods, some broken open, pulsed with energy, connected by power cables to a massive box attached to the roof. As they stood under the strange box, a screen flickered to life, showing the shimmering image of a young woman. The woman spoke."

My purpose is to continue the experiment, no matter the cost."\n\nGunn fell silent for a moment, aware that his men were watching him. Such horrors they had seen, but... this may be his only chance.\n\n"Your experiments... can they fix a man's mind?"\n\n"As I said, MANIFEST is the next step for humanity, it can do so much more."\n\n"But can it fix me!"\n\nSilence. The screen flickered, as if the AI was considering its answer. Gunn's men were silent, yet he could feel their unease at their King's words. Finally, Destiny Spoke.\n\n"It could... serve as a remedy for whatever mental condition ails you. However, only if we could come to an agreement."\n\n"That depends on its conditions."\n\nDespite his uncommitted response, the desire was evident in his voice. A way to escape fate, to prevent his descent into madness.\n\n"I wish to continue the MANIFEST Experiment. Let me continue my work, providing me with test subjects, and I shall do all I can to fix you."\n\nGunn stared up at the image, and then back at Tanner. His loyal friend's face was blank, but his eyes betrayed the fear and distrust he truly felt. Turning back to Destiny, Gunn spoke."

In one of the vats and suspended in the fluid was a human brain—Gunn's new brain—one free from the centuries of degradation and radiation. The King placed his hand on the glass, staring in awe. This was it, a clean slate, free from the constant threat of madness and savagery.\n\nTanner, however, was not looking at that vat. He wiped the condensation on the glass of another, jumping back in shock at what he saw. A horrible lump of flesh and bone, its face mutilated and broken, yet still recognisable. He had arrested this man a month ago and sent him to MANIFEST North as a test subject. Tanner did not trust Destiny, yet before he could voice his concern to Gunn, her deceptively disarming voice spoke over an intercom.\n\n"As you can see King Gunn, a perfectly healthy and stable specimen, as promised. I must run more tests and checks before we can commence the procedure. I shall inform you when it is ready, as per our agreement."\n\nThe King nodded, making his way out of the room, his loyal Mountie close behind. When they emerged into the blinding daylight, Tanner could no longer restrict himself.\n\n"My King... is this wise? I do not trust this machine. Who knows what its true intentions are, for both you and this so-called experiment it runs. You're putting yourself in great risk, and I won't be able to protect you if you go ahead. So please, tell me. Are you going through with this?"\n\nSilence. Not even the world around them made a noise as Tanner stared at his king. Finally, Gunn looked up to meet his gaze and spoke."

His new mind floated peacefully in the vat next to it, the chance at a future of peace bathed in the soft green glow. Gunn was fearful. What if the operation failed? Destiny had well explained the risks of such an operation. He could very well die today.\n\nThinking more on Destiny, the AI did not reassure him. Its experiments continued to produce more and more of those horrible monstrosities, and yet it still demanded more subjects. Even for the most heinous criminals in the Kingdom, Gunn was loath to send them to this fate. If Tanner was right... God knows what this machine would do to him.\n\nYet... he knew he could not afford to refuse this chance. Even now, at the precipice of salvation, he felt his mind claw and scratch at his sanity. If he left now, he would have days left at most. His thoughts turned to Katherine, her lovely smile and her supporting hand. \n\nThis was for her. Determination driving him on, Gunn stepped into the auto-doc, and closed his eyes as the doors slid shut. Immediately, he felt the machine grab him and inject drugs into him.

He stumbled out of the bed, his body feeling numb and... different? What a strange feeling, like it belonged to someone else.\n\nOpening the door, the blinding light made him wince. He stepped out into a room. Some people were there. Did he know these people? They looked... familiar, but for the life of him he couldn't seem to place their names. In fact... he couldn't remember his own name either. Who was he? Why was this woman running towards him? Tears flowed down her face as she threw her arms around him. Strange. This felt familiar, like it's something he has always known.\n\nHe looked down at her. She was hugging him so tightly. Did she miss him? Had he gone somewhere? She reached up to hold his face, and spoke to him.\n\n"Edward, my love."\n\nShe kissed him, and it all came flooding back. Returning the kiss, Gunn spun his wife around in the air, his own tears flowing out in joy. It worked. It actually worked. No longer would he lie awake at night, in fear of becoming a monster. He set Katherine down, and looked towards the others. He laughed as he saw Tanner trying not to smile, standing at attention as always. Gunn made his way over to him, laughing as Tanner saluted him. He clasped his old friend's shoulder, before turning back to wrap his arm around his wife. It was the dawn of a new age for the Kingdom. One that Gunn, for the first time in his life, looked forward to."

Deep within the palace at the heart of the city, in a dark shaded room, sits King Gunn II. The muffled sounds of fireworks barely stir the ghoul king, lost so deeply in his thoughts.\n\nHis hands were shaking in abject terror, at first the visions that now plagued him were like a distant dream, these days they came to him with alarming clarity. Their subject matter was always the same, time and time again he was forced to watch himself tearing through the palace, killing all he could find. He chokes back a sob, the very thought of laying hands on his beloved Katherine revolting, yet he couldn't stop his mind from picturing himself standing over her lifeless body, her blood still dripping from his hands as every instance of him committing the act echoed through his brain with an alarming clarity.\n\nShaking his head, Gunn looks towards a shaded window, the simple act once used to be enough to disperse the shadows clinging to his mind, his mind grasping for a distraction followed the coloured light of fireworks barely creaking in the dimly lit room and for what felt like the hundredth time his attention was drawn to his desk that they now so ominously illuminated. Standing up, he slowly made his way towards the old piece of Victorian furniture that dominated the small room.

It had been a gift, given centuries prior, a past age, a different life, the golden letters reminding him briefly of his true name. He allowed his mind to dwell on his memory, a typically for him this was a day he still recalled vividly, when his friend whose name he shamelessly used, handed it to him. A sign of trust, of brotherhood and his message was still engraved in his mind, that they would both always fight for Canada's people. In spite of himself, Gunn could not help but crack a small pained smile. Gunn had given him a gun. He may have even laughed, if not for the pained nostalgia that overwhelmed him. \n\nHe ran his fingers over the ornate pattern, etched in by hand, though he does not truly comprehend them. Instead, he is thinking about his people, those he has fought so hard to protect in this cruel radiation blasted world. Does he want to be remembered by them as a monster who lost his humanity? A man who in his final moments attempted to bring death? No... Gunn wanted his name to be remembered as it was now. The name of the hero who fought for his people, who gave all he had in order to bring about a life for those he loved.\n\nIt was this thought that filled his mind as Gunn II, King of Manitoba, repeatedly pulled back and reset the hammer on the revolver."

But one stood out as a shining beacon among the rest: his love for Katherine.\n\nTo say the two of them found their love for each other as a source of strength would be putting it mildly. During dark nights when he was at his limit's end and the darkness would come to envelop him, it was thoughts of her love that pulled him through and with those difficult times behind them, Gunn found more time for her. During the critical years of his waning mind, he grew cold and out of touch with her. He feared that, through his condition, he would harm her and he would never be able to forgive himself. His regrets of years past brought him to tonight.\n\nThey had dined on an exquisite meal together, disturbed by nobody. Only Tanner stood watch outside their room, barring anyone from entering. Tonight would be for the King and his Queen only. Gunn flicked the radio on. It crackled to life and the host's words filled the room.\n\n"Hello there ladies and gentlemen. I hope you're having an excellent night tonight. Not much for me to tell you so why don't we skip straight to the song. We've got Mr. Dean Martin's ‘Everybody Loves Somebody' up now, stay tuned."\n\nThe music came on and Gunn smiled.

Her hand was on his shoulder, his on her waist. Fireworks went off in the distance; a celebration had occurred within the city. Gunn's thoughts stirred within, taking him back to that night after Manitoba's victory. A cold lump of steel in his hand, the barrel digging into his temple. He closed his eyes and sighed calmly.

For decades the kingdom's elite could pick and choose who would be able to join their ranks, gatekeeping from those who would see fit to reduce their power, allowing themselves to feast greedily off the people's efforts. It had been a major reason why Three Rivers had rebelled and could yet again plant the seeds for rebellion once more. Gunn knew that, whatever the cost, he would curtail the elite's influence.\n\n"Gentlemen, you must understand, this is what the kingdom needs. We must look back to our previous mistakes and learn from them; not allow ourselves to be caught in an ever-constant cycle. Your privileges shall be reduced, but please calm yourselves. It is not as if we've reduced your role entirely."\n\n"You have no right!" one voice yelled. "My liege, please. We put you in the position you are in today. It was by our efforts that we could guide you to your true role," another begged. Gunn froze, staring deeply at them.

"Don't think I am not privy to your reasons for choosing me. I knew, I always knew! I was not selected for my leadership capabilities or my political abilities. I was selected because you thought you could control me, mould me into your puppet! It may have worked then, but it certainly won't now. I am your King and a king certainly has no use for leeches!

Their aim was to apprehend him and bring him to justice in Brandon.\n\nWith little information to assist them, the squad knew from prior reports that Smiling Jack was frequently spotted around a marsh south of the Hudson Bay City Ruins, accompanied by his faithful court of frostlurks. Operating under the cover of darkness and escaping patrols of deranged cannibals, the group moved toward the ruins of Hudson Bay, once a bustling Manitoban trading hub reduced to rubble and faintly illuminated by scattered fires.\n\nAssessing the situation, Belanger ordered a search of the dark forest south of the ruins. The only sounds piercing the silence were the squad's hushed footsteps, mingling with the calls of crows and frogs. Their search led them to a clearing where a small shack stood alone. Suddenly, the peaceful night erupted into chaos as the shack exploded, revealing a towering, grotesque figureᅳthe mutant Smiling Jack.\n\nWith his rotting eyes fixed on the squad, Smiling Jack unleashed a deafening screech, signaling his monstrous frostlurks to encircle the Mounties. In a desperate move, Belanger lunged at the mutant, hoping to land a fatal blow. However, Smiling Jack effortlessly swatted him away with his elongated limbs.

Lacking any military means of their own, a deal with the devil was made, and a mercenary contract was signed with Electorate raiders known as the Sparkblades. Skating into Wadena, the Power Armour clad players quickly overran the small royal garrison, killing Wadenas lord and looting her palace.\n\nThe celebrations of liberation were short-lived however. The Sparkblades, unsatisfied with their payment and seeking to earn further glory in the eyes of their fellow Electorals, turned on their former employers.
