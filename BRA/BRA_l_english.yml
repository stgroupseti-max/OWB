  bra_bismarck_contracts:0 "Sign Bismarck Arms Contracts"
  bra_bismarck_contracts_desc:0 "Buying weapons from Bismarck holds many advantages, least of all that the Crown at last holds an edge over its pesky nobility.

  bra_welcome_back_metis_desc:0 "[MTC.GetNameDefCap] made history when they were the first [BRA.GetAdjective] territory under the jurisdiction of [BRA.GetNameDef] to declare their independence from the crown and be victorious in their rebellion. This victory was temporary, however, and we must now begin to welcome them back into the fold."
  bra_welcome_back_three_rivers:0 "Restoring Winnipeg"
  bra_welcome_back_three_rivers_desc:0 "Winnipeg was the old imperial capital of the Kingdom of Manitoba, being the largest and most prosperous city in the region and—according to some—Canada as a whole. Although [ROOT.Capital.GetName] has cemented itself as the new imperial capital, Winnipeg still lends itself as a city of great strategic importance in the east."
  bra_saskatchewan_farming:0 "Saskatchewan Farmland"
  bra_saskatchewan_farming_desc:0 "Unlike most of the territory in Manitoba proper, the lands of Saskatchewan were claimed by the Kingdom of Manitoba not for their namesake, but rather for their expected agricultural output. The same still holds true today, especially with the increase in population following our wars to restore the Kingdom to greatness."
  bra_pardon_louis_riel:0 "Posthumously Pardon Louis Riel"
  bra_pardon_louis_riel_desc:0 "The historic Métis champion Louis Riel was executed by the old Canadian government for his efforts to protect the rights of his people. If we are to garner the loyalty of the Métis, we must right this historic wrong. No one shall be discriminated against in this Kingdom."
  bra_western_railroad:0 "Finalizing the Kingsroad"
  bra_western_railroad_desc:0 "One of the reasons for the Métis and Three Rivers' disloyalty to the Kingdom was the distance of Regina and Winnipeg from the Crownlands. Ensuring that these cities are easily accessible should allieviate this contention going forward."
  bra_red_river_access:0 "Access to the Red River"

  bra_aviation_academy:0 "Rebranding the Academy"
  bra_aviation_academy_desc:0 "The Three Rivers' Airforce was more advanced than our Royal Air Force, and it showed primarily in their well-trained pilots. Most of these pilots were taught in the Academy of Aviation founded in Winnipeg following the First Coalition War. There's no reason we shouldn't also use the institution for our own purposes."
  bra_regina_industry:0 "Regina Industry"
  bra_regina_industry_desc:0 "The city of Regina had always been a hub of technological advancement both in prewar Canada and doubly more so in the Kingdom of Manitoba after the Great War. As a result, its industry was generally more sophisticated than even that of the Crownlands."
  bra_robotic_knowledge:0 "Métis Expertise"
  bra_robotic_knowledge_desc:0 "During the Second Coalition war, our military leaders quickly determined that most of the Métis' strength lay in their extensive use of indirect firepower on the battefield. Despite the fact we were inevitably victorious, we can further improve our own army by making use of this knowledge."
  bra_republican_airship:0 "Army Airships"
  bra_republican_airship_desc:0 "The Merchants of Eastern Manitoba were instrumental in the economic success of the Kingdom before their revolt in the Second Coalition War. Their airships ferried supplies from across the continent and the freezing expanse of Canada before the Kingsroad was constructed."
  bra_manitoba_dam:0 "The Grand Rapids Dam"
  bra_manitoba_dam_desc:0 "Despite not immediately evoking feelings of strength and granduer, the Grand Rapids Dam was the Kingdom of Manitoba's first triumph.

  bra_strasbourg_sparkblades_desc:0 "It seems that one of the more popular—and more sane—pastimes in the Electorate is playing or watching Ice Hockey with the most well-known rink located in Strasbourg. The home team, the Strasbourg Sparkblades, appears to be the group that managed to popularize the sport in the raider-infested region with the introduction of power armor and looser rules regarding penalizing violence."

  bra_curb_spectral_cabal_desc:0 "The Spectral Cabal has held influence over the Elecorals lands for far too long. In order to ensure our control over these lands is solidified, they must be curtailed. After all, monarchies and secret orders never seem to end well."

  bra_faery_knowledge:0 "The Faerie Program"
  bra_faery_knowledge_desc:0 "The Faerie Program of Pleasantdale was a horrible solution to a terrible problem. However, we would be fools to completely discard every part of that research.
