    RHO_KYLE_THE_HOOK_NAME:0 "Kyle the Hook"
    RHO_KYLE_THE_HOOK_DESC:0 "Some people are born leaders. These people possess the dynamic personality to guide and influence others through great words and actions. They rise above mediocrity to champion their cause and give meaning to the lives of those who follow. Great and memorable things happen when born leaders set about a task and often become the thing of legends. Kyle the Hook is not that person.\n\nKyle was the guy with the gun. Unfortunately, the Hook had zero influence on his colleagues around him, possessed a pointy stick, and had a rusty meat hook for a left hand to brave the hazards of the wastes. As alluded to earlier, Kyle is also not a very smart raider, though he fancies himself a veritable genius. He will often make up long, polysyllabic words that almost sound real only to give the impression he is rather intelligent and learned."
