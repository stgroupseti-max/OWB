   VLS_OVERSEER_MALTHUS_DESC:0 "Robert Malthus' job is anything but desirable. As the Overseer of Vault 27, his job is fixing a problem that Vault-Tec purposedly created, either for scientific development by observation or for their cruel entertainment - it's hard to tell.\n\nThe Vault has been designed to be heavily overcrowded; planned to have less room and food that the people inside of it required. They picked people from as many different backgrounds and social classes as they could find, hoping to divide the people by all means, making the situation even more complicated. Despite being designed like a "bomb rigged to blow", the long list of overseers directing the facility somehow kept the experiment going and the people alive. The means of controlling the Vault has often changed, overseer-by-overseer, some utilizing a more humane approach, and some using more harsh methods for survival.\n\nRobert's current approach for the situation is strict population control, with maximized number of children and even more rigorous treatment for food management. While he is far from being popular, he is the least rough or cruel leader the Vault has had for a long time."
