  nf_com.1.t: "Sweet Home Americana"
  nf_com.1.d: "The sun of the Florida keys raised Johnson, the warm sun and filled beaches highlighted the adventures him and his friends went on. Those young kids raced the sun down in the fields while gripping their Nuka Cola, they ran so fast that day that Uncle Sam finally took notice. As the sunset on the tarmac, Johnson’s fears only grew as his five friends rocked in their chairs claiming they will come back heroes. The warmth of the sun was traded for the eerie hanging layer of industrial haze and mountains of snow that claim Red Deer. They would walk down the streets, the road crumbled under the weight of their marching boots, the fear in the eyes of the Canadians haunted Johnson as they stared back at him from the shadowed alleys.\n\nThe days of occupation mark Johnson’s mind as he struggles to remember the feeling of sharing their favourite Nuka Cola one last time. It wasn’t long before Red Deer was taken by the snow once more and the thousands of troops that broke the road with him left. As Johnson’s recalls it was as if the reaper came to town and left with the souls of whoever he could find. However, Johnson thanked his lucky stars that he was passed over, remaining on airstrip duty with whoever remains of his best buddies.\n\nThe smog mixed with the snow to grip their lungs, squeezing every ounce of air that was left. It was only the red and green lights on the end of the airstrip that pierced the cancer filled air. Hour after hour, like clockwork the planes would arrive, machines and coffins alike would be unloaded. The line of coffins would be marched alongside the next shipment of flesh for the meat grinder. Johnson and his friends weren’t always lucky, the reaper and the pine wood comes for all. Johnson watched on as his group of six became five, then four as the parade of pine wood continued down the airstrip. It wasn’t all grim marches, there was more, but Johnson can barely remember what was outside that airstrip."
  nf_com.1.a: "Nothing more then occupation..."
  nf_com.1.a_tt: "Two Divisions of §YGreat War Veterans§! will be raised in §Y[1161.GetName]§!."
  nf_com.1.b: "The haze built higher as the factories sprung up."
  nf_com.1.c: "Uncle Sam took whatever he could, like always."

  nf_com.2.t: "The Tenth Circle of Hell"
  nf_com.2.d: "The airplanes kept coming, never late, they were never supposed to stop until one day the airstrip laid empty. The tension was high, the fear was higher, the news from home? Gone, there was nothing coming in or going out. For the first time the four friends gathered that night sipping the local beer trying to calm their nerves. Soon the view of the bar table became nothing, but a blur. How Johnson got to the hill outside of the city he no longer remembers, but what he does remember were the jokes passed between him and one of his friends. His name was Patrick, yes it was Pat that was with him that night on the hill. The two reminisced old times as the rest were back in their bunks. The warmth of the Florida sun was always missed, but for a second even out here that warmth was felt once more as pitch black night turned into a nightmare.\n\nThe atomic fire gripped the two pals on that hill, tossing them and throwing them about. Johnson’s flesh was ripped apart and put back together, his insides turned to iron, it was his hope of going home that kept him on that hill. As the light faded once and the bleak night returned, his eyes closed. It wasn’t long after that light returned and the fear returned, his skin still burning Johnson began to pray. However, it wasn’t hellfire, but flash lights, it was his friends, they came for him. Johnson laid there waiting for them as he heard their horror. The screams and sound of bile hitting the snow still ring out in his ear.\n\nThose early days of the wasteland were spent in a hospital cot, wrapped in field dressings as his pain receptors slowly died. Around the tent, America crumbled and along it so did the occupation. The oppressed residents gripped their maple cocktails and rifles rushing down whatever American soldier they could find. The headquarters was turned into one of those horror pictures as the blood and sinew ran into the streets. Johnson was, eventually, able to stand once more, still covered in field dressing and whatever was left of his uniform met his friends. Johnson, the last ranking officer as a Corporal, grabbed the flag to lead them once more. Just like when they were kids chasing the sun down, what remains of them ran towards the Canadians without fear. It wasn’t long until their city was back and all eyes fell upon the burnt Corporal, orders had to be given and he was the last to give them."
  nf_com.2.a: "He ordered the factories to open once more"
  nf_com.2.b: "He put the engineers to work, helping the army of course."
  nf_com.2.c: "He simply just tried to feed the people..."

  nf_com.3.t: "The Burden of One"
  nf_com.3.d: "The trench works were deep and the fields of lead endless, Red Deer was just the beginning for Johnson and the remnants of the Sixth Brigade. Every direction, every corner of the map was on the docket. The red banners waved all around and their bayonets fixed and just waiting for the order. Yards had turned into miles and the snow had run red as the crimson ghost of the past was pushed into the North. Johnson, fearless in these battles, led their charges against the horde. In the last of these fateful charges, Johnson’s men faced a storm of lead and hail. The hail beat the ground as the Sixth Brigade was ripped apart into two.\n\nThe universal call for a home lost and family atomized still follows Johnson deep into the darkness of night. It had been years since Johnson had burned his mortality, his friends, no brothers from home have aged, but stayed with him. As the hail retreated and the Brigade returned to Red Deer lick their wounds, the pinewood parade took place once again. Johnson always oversaw this display, tags punched, flags placed, and tears shed. On that balcony railing, Johnson’s grip tightened as his eyes began to flood. The days of chasing that sunset had come to an end, six had finally become one. For the first time since boarding that plane, the world had grown dark for the ghoul corporal.\n\nThe decades in Red Deer dragged on as Johnson buried his nightmares at the bottom of any bottle he could find. His last act as leading officer was to create the Commission. It oversaw the lost decades, each American could once again cast their vote. The factories turned on and the fields were planted by communal vote, while Johnson turned into a memory. What was left of the Brigade put food on their table by selling their blood for the highest bounty. Crop failure year after year expanded this need and they gained their infamous nickname, known for miles around.\n\nThe decades had turned into centuries and the eyes of this new world looked back at what was lost. The children heard stories of the great Corporal and the nation he represented while their fathers bled to keep them safe. Movements began, ideas fostered from the oldest ghoul soldiers now officers to the youngest child. The endless debates of stability or liberty never let up in the Commission. However, the monster that Johnson contained has risen once again. A champion will be needed once again, if only that great Corporal in all those legends was still around."
  nf_com.3.a: "Stability shall cage the beast once more!"
  nf_com.3.b: "Liberty will win the day!"

  nf_com.4.t: "The Ravine’s Bottom"
  nf_com.4.d: "The cold, withering embrace of the Canadian chilled bottles grip Johnson as the snow pounds the windows to his apartment. The ghosts of what came before wonder the halls, the picture frames reflect Johnson’s ghoulish face. The floor creaks as the old ghoul shifts his weight while starting down who he was, what he was. With a swift, but sloppy hand he throws the frame, crashing it into his collection of empty bottles. With glazed eyes, he stares down at the mess of glass shards. In a vain attempt, he bends down sliding the pieces across the old carpeted floor as if he was putting a puzzle together. The pounding of the snow still beats hard as the shards scrap the ground sliding together.\n\nAfter hours the shards puzzle comes to an end, looking down all Johnson can see is himself once again. The scars and burns that make up his face jump out to him, the flashbacks from that hill once again surface. The rush of heat floods in the room, the sounds of the snow are replaced with their screams. The memories build, the pain too much, and the memories hazing Johnson swipes the makeshift mirror away. Standing to his feet, Johnson walks back to his chair, grabbing another bottle on his way."
  nf_com.4.a: "He is the last American?"

  nf_com.5.t: "The Walking Corpse"
  nf_com.5.d: "For years the Commission has profited off of the wars from the inevitable failure of the Canadian People’s Front. However, the gravy train has run out and their strongest has risen from the ashes. The so-called Chairwomen Amy Teresee or the Big Sister has united much of the north and is now eyeing our territory. The state of the Sixth Brigade is nothing, but a sad sight compared to the glory days of Johnson’s reclamation. Their arms are whatever was left, the days of standard issued anything is long gone. Now the Commission must decide on how to fix this disgrace.\n\nThe small hall that houses the Commission once again lights up with debate as the two vicious sides try to “negotiate”. The only thing that has been agreed upon so far is the need for a champion, someone to unite and lead what’s left of the Sixth Brigade against these dirty communists. The old ghoul Yankees have suggested that their very own Captain Gallagher should be this champion and that his skill will lead them to victory. On the other side of the aisle Micheal Woods and his Sons of Liberty have brought up an unorthodox candidate. They claim that the living legend Corporal Jack Johnson is the only person who could win. Using his victories as evidence the Commission with a razor thin majority supported the old Corporal candidacy.\n\nThe second the vote passed, Woods started the hunt to track down the legend himself. It didn’t take long for him to find his house, a rundown, dilapidated, house that had seen much better days. Knocking was forgotten as the every second mattered. Stepping cautiously and carefully into the house, they creaked every step of the way. As he entered the hallway a crack voice rang out:“Stay where you are before I send you to see the all mighty.” Johnson said half slurred.\n\nWoods turned to see the ghoul, Johnson stood there in the doorway holding a glass bottle as you would a shotgun. Before Woods could respond, the living legend collapsed onto the ground face first. Without fully processing what happened, Woods took the Corporal for medical attention. Now waiting for him to sober up, it might take days the doctors commented as they passed his bedside."
  nf_com.5.a: "Lets hope he won't sleep for long."

  nf_com.6.t: "Broken Hopes and Dreams"
  nf_com.6.d: "It was years ago now that the Commission sent out colonists to settle the western territories. The small settlements made up of only the toughest of Americans and the refugees of the Canadians and Arcadians were slated for development. Waves of pioneers marched west hoping to forge a home for themselves out of the dirt and the land of the Canadians. The years since have not been kind to these colonizers, their crops failed and their mines came up empty. Now they flee back east, crashing down like waves on the broken coast.\n\nThe Commission is now overwhelmed, their old jobs and housing were filled years ago as Red Deer’s birth rate continued to climb. The city now bugles out with people filling the streets and alleys trying to survive the snow. Captain Gallagher has taken it upon himself to solve this horrible crisis. Forming out of nothing, but a vacant room and some chairs, Gallagher’s new Department of the Interior starts to take shape. With the Commission overwhelmed and running out of manpower, Gallagher forces its hand to pass its new arm of the government. Time will now tell how Gallagher will handle this crisis as Woods looks on in horror with his political moves."
  nf_com.6.a: "Yet another crisis to manage."

  nf_com.7.t: "Above the Call of Duty"
  nf_com.7.d: "The tension at the northern border grows as Johnson starts to sober up from his booze fueled coma. Micheal Woods like clockwork checks the old ghoul for competency every night. In turn, Gallagher meets with his fellow Yankees, plotting how to use this burnt drunkard for their favor. The patrols of both sides’ goons are almost non-stop waiting for Johnson’s awakening. For his part, Johnson is fighting through withdrawals, the shooting pains, the fever, and especially the memories that cripple his system.\n\nFor the first time in years Johnson sits up from his stupor with clear eyes, fresh face, and an almost clear mind. The news of his state reaches Woods as well as Gallagher. It wasn’t long before the offer to lead the Brigade once again was offered to the ghoul. With a sigh and a heavy heart, Johnson agreed. His recovery couldn’t come at a better time, the movement of the communist forces at the northern border had intensified.\n\nThe Sixth Brigade was called up to serve once more, rallying in the city of Alix for their march north. Johnson in his tent starts to assemble his ancient combat armor. The battle scars and ash marks on the plates proves to whoever notices his experience in war. Lastly, the shreds of what remains of his friend’s burial flag remain heavy in his hands. The fabric as heavy as tungsten and the past as vivid as the present. Wrapping his head in the cloth and stepping out of his tent, Johnson knows the horrors that are about to come and that the bright eyed faces among them won’t return the same."
  nf_com.7.a: "Here we go again..."

  nf_com.8.t: "Terrorists Target our Industry"
  nf_com.8.d: "Recent reports have come in that the Commonwealth Popular Liberation Army or CPLA enacted another terrorist attack. The communist insurgents now being funded by the Strath Commune to the north have been emboldened enacting further terror on our people. The most recent was a bombing of critical industry that make up our meager industrial base. Sadly, the terrorists escaped before anything could be done or that is what the police say."
  nf_com.8.a: "Those damn reds!"

  nf_com.9.t: "And The Chaos begins..."
  nf_com.9.d: "The chambers of the Military Tribunal have been nothing, but vigorous debate and some instances of petty violence sprinkled in for good measure. The Tribunal has been set into a deadlock shortly after narrowly passing the officer class reform, but now the factional divide has become unbearable. Johnson, now realizing the mistake of including every faction under the sun, has come to the conclusion that only one path forward is the answer with one faction at the head. To facilitate the development of new sets of military codes, Johnson has given the order for three proposals by the end of the week for all of this nonsense to finalize.\n\nA week passes with all members shuffling around the room day in and out trying to finalize their grand ideas with each other before turning them to Johnson's eye. As the final day grows closer the intensity of the scramble increases and by the final day everyone is sprinting around the room papers in the air trying to get every party satisfied for the grand showdown. Finally, the day comes and now the final judgment will be passed down, the first proposal is the Old Guard.\n\nStepping in front of Johnson's desk an old ghoul wearing dress blues from the pre-war starts to lay out their proposal. An army built from the common folk led by strong men for the single purpose of destroying the last remnants of communism on this Earth. Bearing to force nothing more than rifle in hand and spirit in heart!\n\nSoon after the old ghoul steps away, a young man in scavenged repainted combat armor steps forward to represent the Revolutionary Guard. Their mission is simple, more forward from the past and embrace a new army fit to defend the people and their ideals. An army spear headed by specialized combat units designed to breach the lines of our enemies and encircle from behind. The man ends his speech with a quick jab at his opponent stating that communism is the enemy of the old man.\n\nWho won the day?"
  nf_com.9.a: "We can not let the communists live!"
  nf_com.9.b: "The future is upon us, lets embrace it!"

  nf_com.10.t: "Freedom In The Air"
  nf_com.10.d: "The people of Red Deer have always been a more solemn bunch with life not being the most kind. However, the people today are out in the streets smiling and chatting waiting for the opening of the ballot stations. Many are waving the flags of either the old USA or our more relevant flag discussing who they will vote for. The beginning of public elections have seemed to give the people some hope that maybe just maybe, that there is a future worth living for. We all wait for results to come out!"
  nf_com.10.a: "Let the dice roll!"

  nf_com.11.t: "One Pretty Facade"
  nf_com.11.d: "Today the always solemn people of Red Deer flood out into the streets saying little to each other as they wait in line for the ballot stations to open. At the ballot stations, the Military Police stand guard to “secure” the elections from the CPLA, but they are there for nothing more than to try and sway the vote. Every citizen of Red Deer knows this and such are only in line to avoid retaliation from the police. Even with this, there are still a few who think things can change, but we'll have to wait for the vote to be counted."
  nf_com.11.a: "Let the dice roll!"

  nf_com.12.t: "The Lucky Few"
  nf_com.12.d: "The lottery system that was created to allow only the best workers to choose the direction of the nation has turned the people more productive. The promise of a chance at a vote has pushed the workers, fixing and producing as much as they can in order to be looked favourably by the robotic ballot operator. The ballot operator only chooses who gets to vote based on work ethic, meaning that the decision of the vote is still up in the air with people wondering what will happen next."
  nf_com.12.a: "Let the dice roll!"

  nf_com.13.t: "Opening The Floodgates"
  nf_com.13.d: "For the first time in years the air in Red Deer is one of hopeful optimism with people shuffling through the lines to the ballot stations to cast their chance at a voice. Johnson on the other hand is seen pacing in his office debating with himself whether this was the correct decision. The old ghoul looks down out his window unto the people in the street. Upon seeing this sight, Johnson rushes over to his desk, opening the top drawer revealing an old 10mm pistol covered in layers and layers of dust. His hand stops just before the pistol and the old ghoul starts to remember, remember all of the old deeds. The cries of days past fill his melted head as he falls back into his chair.\n\nIn an attempt to calm his nerves, he tries and grabs the bottle of home-made whisky, but upon seeing his shaking hand he brings it close to his chest in a vain attempt to seize the shaking. The election was carried out with little trouble from any faction, with all valid ballots cast and counted. Johnson, still sitting in his chair staring at his past, the loud speaker kicks on to announce which faction will make up the new legislative body.\n\n“Attention! Attention! The ballots are in, the winner is...”"
  nf_com.13.a: "...The Old Guard!"
  nf_com.13.b: "...The Revolutionary Guard"
  nf_com.13.c: "...The League!"

  nf_com.14.t: "The Ones Who Survive"
  nf_com.14.d: "The night was long and filled with storms of lead and cracks of home-made marksman rifles. Johnson was riddled with holes and a wet ground that left little to the imagination. As the sun started to crack the dominion of the moon, Gallagher and his forces started to retreat. Inch by inch, corpse by corpse, the Sons of Liberty crawled their way from defeat outnumbered two to one. The haze hung over their heads as thousand yard stares were shared by all who witnessed the bloody mess of Johnson. The last American had been slain by those who wore the same stars as him. How could they have done this?\n\nMarch back to Red Deer was solemn, the Enclave lackeys had fled to the countryside with Gallagher, leaving the city to Woods and his men. However, how do they pick up the pieces? Their dreams of America had been shattered, now their champion is laying in a shallow grave. All that is left is terrorists in our forests and an empty desk standing in front of Woods. A man of little note outside his lofty ideals, Sergeant Micheal Woods was destined to be a follower of those with a stronger resolve. Thoughts of failure and loss crept into his mind standing over his mentor’s desk. Will the two end up the same? No, he thought as he realized Johnson's flaw, he lived in a fictional past, they both did. America is dead and tonight was just the intervention, something new must take its place.\n\nThe enraged Sergeant stumbled his way in front of his men, all looking towards him with questions. Answers were needed and answers were what Johnson had not Woods, but he had to give it a shot. Staring out in the crowd the drained soldier noticed something, it wasn’t Americans before him, but those down caste Arcadians. His call for aid fell upon deaf American ears while the forgotten took up the call. Why look to a dead nation which failed its guiding principles when there can be something new, better. The steps ahead became less foggy, but the haze still hung heavy as Gallagher was still out there."
  nf_com.14.a: "Does Woods have it in him?"

  nf_com.15.t: "The Dark Underbelly"
  nf_com.15.d: "For as long as anyone can remember the northern settlements have been nothing, but trouble being filled with the most crazed or fanatical. This was arguably the best place to launch our investigation into the CPLA, if they were anywhere they would be slithering in the north. Our finest men were put to the task being led by Agent Smith, our most “useful” agent. Though we don't know how the information was gained, Smith relayed back to Red Deer that they were able to track down the headquarters of the CPLA. Little time was spared when hearing this news and a raid was planned.\n\nSoon our undercover agents slowly circled the supposed headquarters ready to pounce unto the Strath sympathizers. However, before being able to set in motion the raid a single figure started to approach the door. As he was turning the knob, the unknown man was snatched and pulled away, allowing for five of our men to take his place. Our agents took standard breaching positions, two on each side and one opening the door. As he turned the knob and began slowly opening the door...tick...BOOM...\n\nThe entire building and agents went up in an amazing mushroom cloud leaving nothing, but ashes falling onto the snow. Only three survived the blast and later radiation poisoning, Agent Smith, Agent Seeley, and the mysterious man. How should we interrogate the man?"
  nf_com.15.a: "By the book! We aren't monsters."
  nf_com.15.b: "I mean, who is gonna miss him?"

  nf_com.16.t: "Nothing To See Here"
  nf_com.16.d: "The last two remaining agents were tasked with finding out who the man was without using extra methods. It took ten days of in and out interrogation to grind him down into finally giving into our advances. The mysterious man went by Frits and spoke in a thick accent that only the oldest of ghouls remembered, a German accent. After giving his name soon his whole life story was spilling out of him faster than we could write down.\n\nHe supposedly came from a town called Apolis somewhere in the old Midwest of America. Joining the wider Canadian Communist movement in his youth, spending much of his time operating near his home town until being set west by higher ups. He was given a simple mission of boosting recruitment in our region before officially joining the CPLA.\n\nLittle more was given after this though, about the actual operations of the CPLA he was quiet with only a few mentions of already members. However,  he did let slip that there is a figure known as the Booky, as he was the one who set Frits to open that door."
  nf_com.16.a: "Back to the drawing board..."

  nf_com.17.t: "Nothing To See Here"
  nf_com.17.d: "The last two remaining agents were given the green light to extract any vital information from the man at all costs. It took ten days for Smith and Seeley to beat the truth out of him. The man went by Frits and spoke with a thick unknown accent that only the oldest of ghouls still remember, supposedly a German accent. Frits soon began to tell us his entire life story before he could be set six feet under.\n\nHe says he was originally from a town called Apolis somewhere in the old American Midwest, joining the wider Canadian Communist movement in his youth. While working around his home town he was eventually sent to the West to join the CPLA in our region and tasked a demolition expert. It seems our friend Frits here was the man behind most of the old bombings on our industry.\n\nAs we continued to “extract” information, he gave up the name of his superior, Booky. Booky, as he claims, is the main boss of the militant side of the CPLA, responsible for setting up all the attacks. Frits was still more helpful, giving up the next meeting location of the Booky. Right under our nose in Red Deer."
  nf_com.17.a: "Lets meet this Booky."

  nf_com.18.t: "The Red Glow"
  nf_com.18.d: "Deep within the Red Deer lies a simple little bar named the Red Glow. This simple blue collar bar is used by all in the town from common civilians to Johnson himself. However, Frits told us the secret dealings that go on behind the scenes. Underneath the bar lies a basement that hides the office of the Booky. He stationed himself in a place none of us would have looked.\n\nDuring happy hour, some military police on loan to our two agents start entering the Red Glow undercover acting as they would every other day. Agent Smith and Seeley stayed on the outside watching over the operation from an apartment building across the street in order to not alert the CPLA terrorists. Frits gave the description of the Booky as a white middle-aged man who sports a trench coat to cover his means of destruction. Soon a man spotting the description of the Booky was spotted, triggering our on loan agents to start surrounding. Sadly, all didn't go to plan.\n\nAs our on loan agents started to circle the man seemingly out of nowhere, shots began to ring out from behind the bar as the suspect now took to flight sprinting towards the gunfire, confirming his identity. Luckily, our men were able to rush the back bar taking down the two shooters responsible. They continued this by moving towards the back down the stairs to the basement. Upon reaching the downstairs, the walls were cladded in CPLA flags and surrounded by ordinance. Upon further inspection, behind all the flags were tunnels that led in different directions. The Booky was nowhere to be found.\n\nAs the days passed from the sting, little was heard from the CPLA. It seems we spooked them enough to go silent for now, but with the destruction of the majority of national agents and the loss of any leads, it became cold. Until the next encounter, there was nothing Smith or Seeley could do."
  nf_com.18.a: "They aren't our problem for now..."

  nf_com.19.t: "Right Under Our Noses"
  nf_com.19.d: "Red Deer ever since the bombs dropped have been seen as our pinnacle of power. However, this notation was based upon a lie. Although it has the majority of our officers, it is also the capital of corruption which has left most of our officers on the take. Luckily, we still retain a few patriotic officers who are reporting these instances of corruption, allowing us to track the not so wholesome deeds of our officers.\n\nOfficer Gideon has been slowly funnelling as much evidence of corruption to our central authority. We have now traced a long line of dealings to a bar in the seedy side of town, the Red Glow. In order to prevent the destruction of evidence, Gideon has been sent in to raid the bar.\n\nThe bar is nothing more than a run-down old pre-war office building, replacing the cubicles for tables and the coffee bar with something a little more hard. Gideon with a few other trusted officers entered the bar in uniform like most of the other military regulars. However, it did not go as planned. Soon a bar fight started to break out, a common occurrence. Suddenly everything escalated when a shot rang out over the heads of the patrons leading to a full blown shoot out. Gideon and his officers rushed the two main shooters from behind the bar, they were able to subdue them, luckily ending the shoot out by exiting through the back. The question remains why did they shoot in the first place?"
  nf_com.19.a: "Interrogate by the book!"
  nf_com.19.b: "There is always another way..."

  nf_com.20.t: "Against Our Nature"
  nf_com.20.d: "The central authority has commanded that Gideon take a more cautious approach with our two special guests. Gideon wasn't so pleased hearing this news, stating it was against our “norms”. He would be informed that we can't risk the loss of the valuable information to some of his overzealous means of interrogations.\n\nThe by the book interrogation went underway with neither of the two breaking. On the tenth day Gideon getting close to bring his more advanced techniques out was stopped by a fellow officer, Officer Solomon. Choosing to switch tactics in a more unconventional way. The duo would enter the interrogation room once more, this time with pictures of seemingly random people.\n\nAll the leads of corruption have allowed us to make a network of suspected CPLA members. Stating to the two tied up guests that if they did not start spilling, one by one the people in the photos will go up in smoke. We went through three pictures before one finally broke giving us one sentence, but that was all we needed. The broken man gave us a date and time for the next meeting of the high ranking officials of the CPLA deep in the rural territories."
  nf_com.20.a: "Lets hope we aren't under dressed..."

  nf_com.21.t: "A Moonlight Dance"
  nf_com.21.d: "We held the CPLA with little regard, but it seems they have the taste for a fancier part of life. Deep within the rural territories is a run down luxury mansion that they seemed to have reproduced into their headquarters. Officers Gideon and Solomon were given the finest military issued suits to attend the high class function. Arriving amidst the crowd of CPLA officials and their bodyguards. There are even a few attendees from neighbouring regimes.\n\nBoth of our officers started to get deeper within the luxury party, past the elites discussing the plight of the worker while sipping on pre-war champagne. Soon they found the main event, the hidden back room guarded by two CPLA agents who were little match to our officers. Upon breaching the room they soon found a room full of fanatics debating whether the worker's uniforms be brown or khaki.\n\nLittle notice was given to the two officers holding pistols in their directions besides one woman at the far end of the room, taking flight out the backroom. Gideon and Solomon gave chase by the ever growing debate. Soon the chase led to the women being cornered between our two officers and the balcony railing. A brief discussion sprung up as Gideon's field report noted that the woman claimed to be doing it all for the better of the people, not her own pocket book. This was before she took flight once more, this time ending on the pavement.\n\nOur officers slipped out without little notice as even the party turned into nothing more than a debate hall. While the success of this mission is in question, what is certain is now we have a detailed list of CPLA operatives which has led to us preventing the last few attacks, and it seems the CPLA have been de-fanged."
  nf_com.21.a: "Well, good job boys."

  nf_com.22.t: "Our Nature"
  nf_com.22.d: "Gideon was given full reign by the central authority to extract as much information as possible from two special guests. However, after ten days of pure hell it seems they held to their convictions without saying a word. On the last die Gideon decided to get  a bit more creative with the help of a fellow officer, Solomon. It seems their creative means left much to be desired and has ended with both our prisoners “up in smoke” as the report states. It seems we are out of options at this moment."
  nf_com.22.a: "Another dead-end..."

  nf_com.23.t: "The Tree Bears Fruit"
  nf_com.23.d: "Now that we have given the League authority over our policing duties, they have gone to work using their extensive network for the good of the state. Their connections with the local workers have borne fruit and have given us a lead on the CPLA. Using the new Project Omni police force we can now start bringing in suspects in a more efficient and timely manner.\n\nThrough these hundreds of rotations of workers we finally stumble upon something very interesting. It seems some workers are giving the same story, word for word, as a reason why they are late for work. It would have been missed if we hadn't used such a large sample size. The count as of right now puts about thirteen workers using the same story across the nation showing a correlation.\n\nThe question now is how shall we proceed? We can start rounding up all the suspects and put them into interrogation, but nothing is certain they would give up their partners in crime. Or as the Omni project lead suggests, we let them continue about their lives and watch. Letting the crimes continue to happen in the hopes we get some real leads, is this worth the cost?"

Once they enter however we lose visual and only our imagination can guess what takes place then.\n\nIn order to gain visual on the inside, one of the thirteen was taken into custody and without them knowing, a microphone was planted upon them before they went to Delburne. Acted out as nothing more than a routine papers check the worker didn't suspect a thing. This gave us ears now within the next meeting.\n\nOnce our new “agent” entered the abandoned factory we were given the best present of them all. It seems the meeting was to discuss the expansion of an underground tunnel system. This now piqued our interest, with little more said, but some phrases which seem to be in code.

Eventually the patrons who had corrected papers were filtered out, the one remaining man in a trench coat was forced at gunpoint to lead our robots to the tunnel and so he did. As he walked down the stairs followed by our robots. Upon reaching the basement a room filled with walls covered in CPLA flags, the man began to remove them all showing the tunnel network. After removing the last flag the man was quickly dealt with moving onto the next mission objective.\n\nAll the robots started to move through the tunnels, however no other side destination was manned.  It seems they were tipped off by someone. The robots instead blew the tunnels leaving nothing left of the CPLA rats to use.

During the fury of reforms, talks of a new agency started to circle around the statehouse with even Johnson taking notice.\n\nAfter the ending of the statehouse conference, Johnson has decided to use the few powers left to him to establish a forgotten institution. Before the bombs, the United States used the Defense Intelligence Agency as their hand in all sorts of affairs internal and external. Now, it will be headed by its new Director, the former Special Agent Smith. Director Smith will be tasked with dealing with the tribals in our northern territories.

In this effect two methods have been outlined to the Director. Method one named Operation Hood, would involve the use of the local military assets to forcefully remove the Strath sympathizer. These sympathizers would either be jailed if held captive or driven back over the border to their motherland.\n\nSecondly, method two outlines a more subtle operation. That being an inflation campaign in order to remove the organization once and for all. Named Operation Bell it would involve Special Agent Seeley to head an undercover campaign with the aid of our prisoner Frits. While the risks of this method are much higher, the devastation of the landscape and population would be much more limited in scope.

The heartless technocrats that now reside in the old Camrose installation we must now deal with them. They undermine our authority throughout the nation by sending our engineers on strikes ever since the election. In order to solve the political subversion, Director Smith has two methods laid out.\n\nMethod one named Operation Glass, would entail the use of military force to subdue the influence of the League from Camrose. In doing so, the headquarters of the League will be taken by force sending the upper brass into custody. The hope is that within the authority the lower organization will fall apart under its own weight and complexity.\n\nMethod two named Operation Tide, sets out a more conservative method of dealing with the League. Instead of the militancy of the Glass, Tide would use engineers within our own sphere of influence as pawns to undermine the League.

Once the agents reached the outskirts of the farm, the firefight began without notice. It seems the CPLA were laying in wait for our agents which allowed them to fire the first shots. However, the increased number of agents gave our forces the advantage pushing back the CPLA forces back to the center of the farm. In little time the remnants of the CPLA were either disarmed, chased back across the border or detained. It seems the Strath meddling has come to an end.\n\nThe last directive of Operation Hood states that once the enemy forces have been removed from the area, a continual occupation will be held in order to secure the border from future activities.

As our agents entered the dark unlit building  carefully, they were finally greeted by the League.\n\nThe top brass that were hiding in the headquarters seem to have taken the easy way out this time. They were hanging from the rafters in the lobby of the old government installation. Upon this sight some of the agents present let their lunches come back up to say hello. The more strong willed of them decided to dig deeper within the building to find out what truly happened here. As they went deeper into the depths of the bowls of hell they were shown even worse sights.\n\nSadly the top brass weren't the only League members present and without commands  more rope it seems, the rest of the members fought amongst themselves. Scenes of carnage were on display to our agents as regular looking citizens were brutally slain by fellow members with none remaining. Beyond these hellish displays laid one steel door ajar. Once opened it revealed the lower levels of the building which started to give some answers.\n\nSitting on the back was a pile of computer parts all connected together with a flickering screen that showed a humanoid face. Along with the grotesque face, sounds of mashed English echoed the halls with nothing making sense.

Two other strike teams will be sent to the respective headquarters of each in order to secure our other agents and their assets before retaliation can be taken.\n\nAs the meeting day arrived, the set location being the old warehouse within the Camrose, the building started to fill up quickly with the most wanted of each party. Representing the CPLA was the head herself, Colonel Thao the most elusive going by the Red River in most mentions. This meeting has allowed us to put the code name to the face.

With little spared by our agents all were detained within the building, except Colonel Thao who seems to have lived up to her reputation and has disappeared into the wind.

At the outset the sheriffs' shotgun blasts and fragrant disregard for their own lives led to a breakthrough as the opposing soldiers broke formation. The soldiers were retreating back to the local station ready for a last stand.\n\nA new line was created around the station as our men circled the remaining soldiers readying for the final attack. A brief silence erupted from the onslaught of the gunfire as both sides stared towards each other. The peace wouldn't last for long however, as the sheriffs once again renewed their assault, opening up their shotguns once more. The station was lit up, shining from all the blood and muzzle flash pouring out of the windows. With little time, but much bloodshed, our men entered the station and soon the true horror would begin.\n\nClearing the station was a bloody affair, from room to room and hallway to hallway every square foot had to be cleared. By the end all of the walls and our men were drenched with blood, but whose shall not be known.

The sheriffs and soldiers alike started to sneak their way into the alleyways, the sweat pouring down Woods’ forehead as he stared at the snowy ground awaiting the echoed shots.\n\nThe shots rang out in series, each sector lighting up as the combatants met each other. The Enclave soldiers’ power armor allowed them to resist for a while until the firebombs were brought out. Their power armor quickly turning into metal coffins, cooking the goliaths while the remnants fell back to the police station.

The sheriffs and soldiers rushed into battle with home-made pipe shotguns that ripped the Enclave soldiers apart as they either tried to flee or beg. The anger and brutality was endless, entrails painted the walls and loose limbs filled the hallways. Woods now entered the city, walking past the red snow until he saw what remained of the station. Bellowing with flames and crumbling under its own weight with only his men walking away.

All sorts of workers have walked out of their positions flooding the streets with signs and  chants. These protests fill our north cities, as they wish to return to a communist model of economy. The local police force made up of local residents have been weak to enforcing the law as they themselves have sympathizers for the workers.\n\nAfter all the pain and  blood shred we can not move backwards and let our mortal enemy retake control from us. In this effect, martial law will be declared in the region allowing for more direct authority to be carried out. From this position of strength we shall undertake more extreme methods to remove such influences from our nation.

In addition, the new rising threat of communism has left only one choice, to leave them be.\n\nWhile Woods is far from a believer, using their text as teaching aids for moral lessons at most, the developments still worry him.

Sitting in his gloomy old apartment, fit not for a leader of the nation, but for a lowly soldier, just how he likes it. The war trinkets shine on the wall as he falls back into his chair, turning the radio on. Reports from front, broadcasted hourly for the families back home.

Labels designed to pull people together away from the Canadian and American titles. For centuries those ancient labels were used to brutally slaughter and oppress the other. In order to build a future, there must be a united house, a  united people, so Arcadian or Cascadian, doesn’t matter, we are united.\n\nThe speech from Woods crackles out through the radio waves, hoping to avoid any disunion in the new territories.

Redmond was out flanked by the advancing Brigade and Wood’s elite troops, but they stayed in their fox holes. Makeshift mortars rained lead hell upon their utopian heads as fire teams ready their last charge. Street by street, the Americans showed once and for all why the stars' spangled banner will always wave. Entrails and sinew covered the streets and soldiers alike, even Woods himself looked just as red as the Strathcommune flag. After all the sacrifice the war had been won once and for all.\n\nThe question of what to do with the destroyed city of Redmond, the streets crumbled and red while the buildings lay bombed out. All looked not to the Commission, but to Johnson. Hesitating on his abilities, the old ghoul started small. He ordered all fallen American soldiers to be boxed up and sent home to be buried where they belonged. For the rest, burn them, and let Satan deal with their bodies. Swiftly after the calls for reconstruction echoed by the Canadians, begging Johnson for his pity. In turn, Johnson remembered the eyes of the Canadians from when he first arrived here all those years ago. Those pain filled eyes have haunted Johnson, turning his vengeance into mercy and thus he pledged to rebuild their city.\n\nWhile Johnson and Woods were playing liberators in Redmond, Gallagher was doing what he did best, keeping order. The news of their victory riled up the local populace, forcing the Yankees to keep a closer eye. Groups such as the League and rogue communist forces decided it was their time to strike. Why wouldn’t they, after all the majority of their forces were up north leaving Gallagher with a skeleton crew and an angry enemy. Something had to be done and Gallagher was the one they looked to in Red Deer. The self titled Secretary of the Interior now has to live up to his title or burn out just as Johnson once did."

Johnson stands in his makeshift Redmond office, signing orders and directing the future of the north as a whole without a word from the Commission. The legend of Johnson as a merciful war hero has made its way throughout the north and back to Red Deer. Canadians, Arcadians, and Americans are starting to follow his example, working with each other with small gestures of kindness.\n\nAs the new dawn rises in Redmond, Red Deer is still cloaked in the darkness of order. Gallagher and his Yankees are noticing the rising popularity of Johnson, the revolution has just begun and they now know it. America died by the hands of the communists and Canadians, they can’t let them rip away what is left. The night clouds their movements, the Commission nothing more than a puppet regime to Gallagher and his new society. This American Society seeks to end this futile advancement of liberalism.

While the army tears itself apart and Johnson drinks through the national stockpile of alcohol, Gallagher gathers his most trusted. A new cabal of military officers gather in the deepest and darkest holes in the commonwealth to plan their next move in order to replace Johnson.\n\nAlthough all is not so easy for Gallagher and his cabal, while they plot to remove Johnson and seize power for themselves, there are others who also have visions of the future. During the death wails of the Revolutionary Guard movement, something started to rise again from its ashes.

The few that surrounded the crash stared at each other in anticipation hoping that someone would volunteer themselves to pry open the doors of the now dormant mechanical beast. But suddenly the silence was interrupted by a series of huge rumbles coming from inside the vertibird that shook the ground beneath their feet as the hinges of the side doors and their nearby sheet metal began glowing with heat. Every man braced their firearm as they expected death would follow the moment those doors came off, a series of large and thunderous knocks came from the door as whatever was inside the belly of the beast was fighting its way out. Within a moment the hinges broke loose and the door flung itself ten feet away, almost hitting one of the officers. After their eyes turned from the loose door they saw a dark figure stick its arms out from the wreck, seemingly covered from head to toe in armor.\n\nThe being they thought could be either man or machine suddenly exclaimed in a fit of rage:\n\n“Fuck! Ramirez, Olson... Any of you alive in there?”\n\nHis words were met by silence as the officers looked at each other completely confused. The man began climbing out of the colossal vertibird as he mumbled to himself, throwing out what seemed to be a plasma weapon and some radio equipment onto the outside snow. He quickly jumped out of the interior and instantly the air grew stiff for everyone in the area as the military police had no clue whether this man was friend or foe. As soon as the man and the accompanying hulking suit of power armor hopped out of the aircraft a stare down was started. One of the officers quickly exclaimed:\n\n“Halt right there! We are members of the Commonwealth Remnants, identify yourself, NOW!”\n\nThe tension in the air grew thicker each second as the men considered how they would apprehend this beast of a man..."

The Captain cladded in his finest army issued uniform passed down the generations, approached the beast. Stopping just short of the unknown creature, the Captain stood there looking up and down what lies in front of him just as the creature reciprocated. The silence was broken shockingly by the creature dropping his plasma rifle to the ground followed by the sounds of the machine unwrapping from the creature, out stepping a regular man. This man in what seemed to look like a flight suit extended his hand saying:\n\n“Sergeant Schultz reporting from the MacArthur Enclave Detachment.”\n\nCaptain Gallagher cocked his head to the side and without a word let his fist fly, dropping the supposed sergeant to the snowy ground. Gallagher then swiftly turned to his men ordering them to secure the area and the hulking machine.

Soldiers cladded in the best scrap uniforms Gallagher could muster surrounded the old government mansion that held the League headquarters. Running around the complex securing all exits, running through the snow as quiet as mice avoiding detection.\n\nFinally, the silence was broken with swift cracks from the barrel of the soldiers’ rifles as the League guards stepped out to start their early morning patrol. The mansion courtyard lit up like fire cracks as streams of bullets flowed from all directions. After turning the guards into puddles of blood and pocket protectors, the soldiers finally made their way into the mansion itself. The League supporters were nothing less than fanatical, fighting for every inch of the decrypt mansion, throwing themselves at the soldiers wherever they could. However, their actions could not hide what was left buried in the basement.\n\nWhen the Mansion was secured and the fanatics either laying dead or arrested Gallagher made his way into the belly of the beast. The dark shadowy room was lit up only by the flickering of a half working computer screen. The wall behind was full of jars seemingly holding within real human brains.

Through snow, forgotten earthworks, and mortar holes there lies their target. While Johnson and Woods have their fun in Redmond, Gallagher will finish the war.\n\nThe Farm was a small complex on the border region surrounded by timber walls guarding the hammer and sickle beast that was within. Gallagher stayed on the outskirts with his soldiers waiting until night came once more. As the stars came out dancing among the pitch black night sky, the soldiers started their own dance. While the communists sympathizers sang war songs around bonfires, the American soldiers broke through the walls going deep into the complex without being noticed.\n\nThe songs continued, but now with booze joining their celebrations. In the background, the night was alive with the soldiers taking aim at all the bonfires filled with the communist. Finally, when the songs reached the climax with their cups raised and lyrics being belted the night was filled with cracks. Bullets filled the cups as the vodka flooded the ground alongside the red rivers. Within seconds the night sky was silent once more, the stars still danced while the communists and their dreams sank into the red snow for the last time."

Across the room was Gallagher leaning against the wall holding a holotape with a strange American flag printed on it. Gallagher flipped the tape up with the strange flag pointing at the sergeant saying:“Enclave huh, explain this one more time and if you make me believe you this time I will open the door.”\n\nSergeant Schultz sat up from the musty bunk swinging his legs slamming his combat boots back onto the floor as Gallagher continued to stare with the holotape. Schultz rubbing his dog tags looked up at the shadow covered captain finally saying:“Like I said the last three times Captain, we are the Enclave. The surviving US government who is trying to restore order to our country.”\n\nGallagher returned his answer with silence leading to Schultz stomping to feet and demanding:“Now Captain, I have answered all your questions. May I please inform our commanding officers about the situation in Canada?”\n\nWith this stance of defiance Gallagher smirked and walked past Schultz. When the door opened, Gallagher beckoned the sergeant to follow. The two soldiers made their way to the main command of the occupation. Once in the lazy command center filled with old ghouls and on duty guards, Gallagher handed Schultz a radio saying:“Call them, let's see if Uncle Sam is still around.”\n\nSchultz began flipping through the radio channels sending out the distress signal. Gallagher just remained silent as he played with his sidearm waiting for the lie to fall apart until the radio spoke back.\n\n“Sergeant Schultz, MacArthur Command here do you copy?”\n\nGallagher's eyes widened along with the rest in the room.

Along with these shipments of goods, fresh soldiers are here to continue the occupation started by our forefathers. They flood out from the base every time, buying out the booze in the Red Glow and enacting “order” as they claim among the population at large. The Secretary has a saying for these soldiers:\n\n“Uncle Sam can do what it wants as long as the cigars keep coming.”\n\nAcross the commonwealth in the north, Johnson paces his office debating with Woods. The two go back and forth in the night wondering how to proceed with the developments in the south. The Enclave can’t be trusted, nor can Gallagher and his Yankees or whatever they call themselves now. The debate was cut short as a communique was received. Johnson was ordered back to Red Deer to report his success in the north. With a sigh Johnson walked out the room, without much choice reading to head back to Red Deer.\n\nJohnson’s convoy sped out through the night for the capitol wondering how best to defend themselves from the Enclave, what would be the best debate strategies? Woods, still sitting in Johnson’s office, hears the incoming of another communique, this one from his old friends in Red Deer. Addressed for Johnson, it warned of Enclave forces locking down Red Deer, claiming a communist convoy was heading from the north to Red Deer.

Only the occupation soldiers walk the streets in order to prevent any more “events” from occurring under their watch.\n\nWhile the mines start to reopen and the talks of a new nuka cola factory are a buzz around town. In Redmond Johnson and Woods hear of the developments, Uncle Sam is back? The hatred for the ancient government still burns within Johnson for leaving them behind. Woods, similarly fearful, ordered his troops to guard the northern provinces, the Enclave being on a strict leash in the north, which made them begin to ask questions. Gallagher had conned them into believing that he and his American Society ruled the Commission, but their influence ended in Johnson’s north.

Johnson naively unaware continued on, practising his speech in his jeep, trying to get his punctuation right.\n\nThe night wore on and midnight came, the gap between Woods and Johnson grew smaller and smaller, but it wouldn’t be enough and Woods knew it. As he drove on, he flipped through the radio calling out for Johnson or any friendly forces in the area. The call had been sent out, but the Enclave jammers killed Johnson’s and Gallagher’s reception. Hope started to come back as Sons of Liberty units started to answer back, stationed around the central plains they started their own march to Red Deer.\n\nThe time had finally come as the clock struck three, Johnson’s convoy came into range entering the kill box. The Enclave troops popped out from their fox holes opening fire as the disoriented convoy troops returned with whatever they had.

Laying on the ground behind a dumpster was a beaten and tattered ghoul. With haste, holstering his pistol and cradling the ghoul, Gallagher saw his face. It was Price, jaw broken, black eye and all. It seems the soldiers from the tarmac came for some vengeance. The clock ticked away on the hospital wall, as Gallagher watched over his friend in the hospital bed. The sneers from Enclave doctors were noticeable, but Gallagher by force of law or lead would ensure Price’s recovery.\n\nThe night dragged on as Gallagher thought of the situation he found himself in. His family is being hunted by the very same people who are helping him. It was the Enclave that filled the shops, paved the roads, but it was also the Enclave that almost killed Price. Shaking his head and dropping it into his palm, was this the cost for order Gallagher thought? He continued to ponder, knowing there must be a way to safeguard his family.

This grand majority began to take center stage, forming coalitions better than the bitterest of enemies all for the greater good, reconstruction.\n\nThis majority took up the name of the Unionist Party, their core principle and aim was to restore the Union from sea to shining sea. In this light, the new government for the commonwealth was constructed, along with a new name. Before the war there were three branches of government now there will be four. The new fourth branch will be the Governor General and Johnson will be presiding in the office for the time being. This new branch will be used as a safeguard against congressional power by presiding over the legislative body with executive control and a more expansive veto. The Judicial branch will remain unchanged and the highest court will still be able to check the fourth branch with a majority ruling. Finally, the presidency will be suspended until the Union is reborn.\n\nThe new branch and changes to the old governing system is a method in securing the future of the American people. While the old Bill of Rights and Constitution will be ratified once again, they will be superseded by the Red Deer Accords granting the earlier mentioned changes.

For days now, the debate of whether the Congress means anything fills the halls of every governing body. In this vein, Johnson has decided to restore Congress to its rightful place in governance.\n\nLate in the night there was a declaration dissolving the token Congress and enacting another Constitutional Convention. Within hours the declaration had made its way through the nation, forcing every politician to their feet, off to Red Deer once more. The debate was furious among the delegates, the first question was whether a full Congress can withstand corruption or will it fall to bribery once more. However, soon a compromise was struck.

Once more the shelves are lined with American made goods, new rebuilt trains connect the city. It was only yesterday the streets were barren Johnson thought to himself.\n\nWith the golden light starting to flood into his well worn office, Johnson started to gaze over all his trinkets once more, this time with a smile. From the tattered flag still holding the stripes together to the picture of his beloved former company during the occupation, memories filled Johnson's mind of the past. However, something shiny caught the elderly ghoul's eye. Hidden behind all the old war memories was a simple Nuka-Cola bottle. Glimmering in the light, Johnson started to think back while holding the bottle. The final day of summer when he was still a young man. The day all his childhood buddies had one last cola before signing up to fight the communist menace.\n\nThe bottle was more than just a simple piece of ancient glass to this old ghoul, it was a monument to a better time. A time when the golden hues filled the windows every morning, before there was bombs and lead there was Nuka-Cola and old friends. Gripping the bottle tight, Johnson walked back over to the window and looked back down at the street. It was in that moment, that Johnson dedicated himself to regain that golden past for not only himself, but this generation. First it was Red Deer, next it could Dallas or Los Angeles.

Coined the Southern Crisis by a reporter of the Federalists Times stationed in Austin, this so-called crisis has commanded Congress' attention. It seems our three southern Commonwealths of Sonora, Rio Grande, and Texas seem to have gained their fair share of home grown resistance.\n\nThe Sonoran Commonwealth being the least concerning of the three is plagued by cartel activity. Even though we have crushed their cartel “states” their smuggling operations and jet trade is far from being squashed out it seems. In recent news the cartels have begun to start protection rackets in the more isolated regions of the Commonwealth. Sadly, due to the relatively new creation of the Commonwealth its lackluster police has reached out to Congress for federal support.\n\nNext in line is the Rio Grande Commonwealth, home to the most staunch resistance. Rio Grande has always been a melting pot in the wasteland between American, Mexican, and native Rio Grande culture. The differences have recently come to a head after the Commonwealth was established. With the influx of American business and settlers to the region, this has started a culture war between the three groups. With Mexican rebels now conducting bombings in governmental buildings. Support has been called for by the Commonwealth's Congress, but with Sonora already asking for aid, the budget has come into question.\n\nFinally we have the Texan Commonwealth, the birthplace of this crisis. The Brotherhood of Steel like always is the center of Texas' problems. The Texan Chapter of this terrorist organization is soon to face trial for their crimes against America and the people of Texas. In response a group based out of Shreveport has started to protest in hopes of the Texan Chapter to receive the death penalty. This has placed Congress in a precarious situation, with their protests growing ever larger across the Commonwealth. Executing that many individuals could be considered a crime in itself even if they did commit treason.\n\nThis Southern Crisis comes at the worst time for these three Commonwealths as elections for governor have still yet to take place. With candidates just now starting to declare their intentions to run for these offices, political instability is front and center in all three races."

The eastern region of Texas has slipped into a lawless mess that the few Texas Rangers left can't keep under wraps. On hearing this news Johnson had to make the tough call of declaring a State of Emergency within the Texan Commonwealth. To remedy the situation, under this declaration the Texas Governor election has been postponed as well as the National Guard taking full control of the rebellious Commonwealth.\n\nThe man now in charge of the whole Texan Commonwealth is none other than Adjutant General Christopher Harrison, the head of the Texan National Guard. Harrison was hand picked by Johnson himself to lead this operation as his experience and knowledge of the region goes back to before the Great War. However, his appointment has come under some flak from the press. Headed by the Federalist times, the critics of Johnson's actions have come flooding in. They are calling Harrison and his administration a “military junta”, declaring Texan democracy dead before it began. The press keeps rolling out headlines smearing Johnson while Texas is on fire."

At first it was simply advocating for the hanging of the Brotherhood of Steel, but now it has taken an anti-American outlook. The violence has also escalated to bands of militias barricading off whole settlements.\n\nThe bad news doesn't end there as the trial itself is reaching an impasse. Under federal law everyone including the Brotherhood of Steel has the right to a fair trial of their peers which they argue can't be done in Texas. They have argued to move the trial to Red Deer the federal capital to avoid a mistrial or a harsher sentence then needed. However, if Johnson approves this measure it would surely tank his support in Congress and in Texas. On the other hand if he doesn't approve the Brotherhood of Steel will surely be sentenced to death. The issue is now in the hands of Johnson."

Johnson refused any comment on the verdict, stating instead he wishes to focus on rebuilding the Texan Commonwealth. As the violence and protests calm down in Texas, Red Deer has announced that the Governor's race is no longer postponed with talks of candidates already filling the air.\n\nThe ruins of eastern Texas have already been slated for reconstruction by the Texan National Guard. However, some tension still exists in these regions. Some still fear that one wrong move might cause another uproar.

Once they were shipped into the courtroom, the trial had finally begun with everyone around the country holding their breath. It was a quick decision, the jury had found them guilty of treason. However, they only sentenced the highest ranks of the organization to prison leaving the rest to walk free.\n\nIt was the Federalist Times that got word of this verdict out first, but once they set it free it spread like a wildfire. Upon reaching the land of the Lone Star, the uproar had finally reached its fever pitch. The chaos started in Texarkana, by that time night had settled upon the land, but that didn't stop the rioters. The city burnt down its foundation, killing hundreds in the process. So-called revolutionaries filled the streets waving the hammer and sickle calling for a free Texas.\n\nOnce day broke the mob rule turned into something different. The city of Shreveport took up the call and under some crazed fool's rule they assembled a separatist nation.

Bang's background in governing and trade caught their eye and his platform has been seen favourably by the public as a whole. It seems the populace of Texas wishes to get back to some normality after all the chaos.\n\nThe second candidate fielded by the Reformist Party is one out of left field, that being the super mutant Keats.

As of the time of reporting, many of the ballots have been counted, with two major parties within the area competing in the race to elect the Commonwealth Governor.\n\nThe supporters of the Reformists in the area have selected Todd Howitzer, CEO of the Texas Arms Association. Howitzer is reputed by the Reformists for his ideals of building an economically flourishing state, having broken away from the previous Republic of the Rio Grande in a dramatic show of force, which unfortunately came to be known in the area as the Day of the Dead. An ironic moniker for a day typically spent remembering ancestors and family heritage for many Mexicans. Now known to former Republicans for remembering the lives lost during the secession of the TAA. Tensions have already risen throughout the nation upon announcement of Howitzer's nomination, with many native Mexicans remarking that the soul of their nation will be corrupted by his American influence.\n\nThe Unionists, by contrast, have thrown their support behind Dante Guerra, previous president of the Republic of the Rio Grande, tragically widowed following his clash with the forces of the terrible Centurion Paullus. He and his daughter, Veronica, have since championed a peaceful resolution, promising to heal the wounds between Mexicans and Americans. Although some insist that Guerra will continue to be nothing more than a puppet or figurehead for American interests, many native Mexicans, almost all hailing from the Republic of the Rio Grande, have found themselves satisfied with his stewardship.\n\nWhen asked for comment, both Howitzer and Guerra refused to release statements. Howitzer's secretary, a rather humble young male, yet inexplicably attracted to Howitzer, only testified to this reporter: "He just works. And you can quote me on that."

They were all unmutated humans, most of them either NCO's or the few human officers that the Commonwealth had on hand. \n\nStanding at the back of the briefing room was a representative from MacArthur, who was presiding over the brief and operating the projector; this was a recent development, the Enclave remnants imposing upon him these "attachés." \n\nGallagher did not like the idea of having handlers peeking over his shoulder, but MacArthur had insisted their experience with "this sort of thing" would make the process go smoother; he didn't want to think about what that meant. \n\nGlancing behind himself Gallagher saw an indelicate depiction cast onto the projector screen; A half rotted ghoul head, partially obscured by a big red cross hair. The drawing -another "gift" from MacArthur- was disgusting, taking great effort in depicting an accurate portrayal of rotting flesh; Gallagher wondered to himself how when the Enclave had found the time to put it together between yesterday and now. \n\nRealizing he ought to be speaking, Gallagher turned back to the men and cleared his throat, adjusting his posture: "Good Evening, men. We are imperilled by a great threat, greater than any we've seen before and it comes entirely from within." He paused, letting his words sink in. \n\n"We've discovered plans for a coup, written up by our very own ghoul officer corps." There were murmurs in the crowd, the lie tasted bitter as it passed through Gallagher's lips. "Your complete loyalty and cooperation in this matter is essential, and under your seats are documents detailing the role you will play in undoing this mess. Take them back to your quarters and begin studying them immediately, do not tell anybody else about what we've discussed here." \n\nHe turned his head back to the MacArthur watchdog.

Gallagher opted to spend the duration of the purge locked in his office, partially for his own safety, partially so he could drown himself in drink. \n\n Gunfire racketed through the halls and in the open areas outside, just barely muffled by the walls. Gallagher's numb drunkenness did little to assuage the sudden onset of regret, but it was too late to go back now. \n\nHe stood from his desk, gripping the bottle of vintage hootch by the neck, and loosely marching over to the massive display case that adorned the eastern wall of his office. Medals, awards, pristine firearms, mementos, even a few actual pictures taken with salvaged cameras! \n\nOne picture in particular caught his eye, a small framed black and white still of him standing amongst a crowd of decorated ghouls, the very same men he was currently wiping off the planet. All smiles. \n\nThe sweet memory was dwarfed by the one next to it, trapped in a rich, ornate frame. It was a full color picture of him shaking hands with the representative from MacArthur, taken during one of the first treaties. The MacArthur man was flanked by armed guards, and Gallagher was alone. \n\nSeeing the two pictures next to each other filled Gallagher with anger! Anger at what, even? He was mad at MacArthur! They made him put together this wretched, unfair, evil operation! \n\nWithout thinking, Gallagher put his fist through the glass door of the display case, not even feeling the long, web-like cuts that trailed across his hand. He pulled the larger picture out through the jagged, uneven hole he'd created. He threw the thing on the ground, stomping it furiously with his boot! The little decoration gave no resistance, the glass of the frame shattered and the frame cracked, and before long it was nothing more than unrecognizable debris beneath his feet."

His eyes unfocused, the various curios in the case fading into visual mush, and the previously invisible image in the glass becoming clear. \n\nGallagher's reflection, looking shockingly haggard, stared back at him. The man's eyes were bloodshot and wild, his uniform untucked and creased in a dozen places it shouldn't be; his hand dripping scarlet viscera onto the floor. Through the alcoholic haze, Gallagher was struck by a moment of utter clarity. \n\nHe wasn't mad at MacArthur, he was mad at himself. \n\nHe accepted the deal, he drew up the plans, he gave the orders. At the end of the day, there would be nobody more fitting to shoulder the blame of this than Gallagher, and the horrible truth of that cascaded through his body and balled his essence up into nothing more than deep feelings of dread, unease, and dismay. \n\nHaving been roundly defeated by his own reflection, Gallagher marched back to his desk and fell into his chair, nursing the bottle like a newborn and uneasily watching the screen of his terminal. \n\nHe'd missed the last dozen messages, they were invariably "all clear" signals send from the teams. \n\nIt was done."

The private seemed confused, reaching into his pocket and passing down a paper map. Gallagher flipped it open, studying the various markings on it silently. \n\nThe map marked three "Dump sites" labelled Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie. \n\nGallagher cringed, his hands clenching and crushing both ends of the map. "Dump sites? Private, why aren't these men being buried properly?" \n\n"Garrison's at half strength, sir. Can't spend all day burying ghouls, wouldn't have anybody left to keep watch." The private answered, almost looking a little confused by the question. \n\nGallagher paused, letting out a long sigh and returning the crumpled map. The soldier was right, as were...whoever had given this order. The indecency of a mass grave made his stomach turn, but there was little more that could be done at this point."

They were clad in that dark beige Enclave uniform that Gallagher had gotten used to seeing more frequently lately. They stood at parade rest, with holstered pistols -ballistic ones, maybe 10 millimetre- in plain view. \n\nSeeing Gallagher, one stepped aside, and the other held open the door. Gallagher stopped, choosing not to enter just yet. "Who posted you here? It wasn't me." \n\n"That'd be Santiago, sir." \n\nSantiago? He had no staff by that name, and certainly none who had the power to start planting guards outside his war room! \n\nGallagher stepped inside and looked about the...strikingly unfamiliar surroundings. \n\nAll of the old world flags that had been hung up were replaced by crisp, new MacArthur ones, and everybody milling about the different terminals and maps was wearing those same beige uniforms. Most of the faces were unfamiliar, new appointments to recently emptied positions. Finally, most obviously, no ghouls. \n\nOne of the lesser officers noticed Gallagher entered and called out to the room. "Command on deck!" Everybody stopped what they were doing and stood at attention. Gallagher let them hang there for a while, scanning across their faces."

Gallagher was, admittedly, not paying attention. Instead, he was just blankly staring down at the orderly's face. He was a younger man, with soft, pampered skin and energetic green eyes. He looked like he hadn't spent a day of his life in a combat zone. \n\nGallagher gazed down to the man's uniform, perfectly pressed and with little ribbons and badges places immaculately; the most prominent of which was a capital E surrounded by many little black stars. \n\nSo, this was it. The Enclave. One of many little cogs in the machine that asked Gallagher to cut down every person that really mattered to him. He wanted to kill the little bastard. Wrap two hands around that svelte neck and wring the life out of him. \n\nThe orderly seemed to pick up some signal of murderous ideation in Gallagher's eyes, and paused, looking back up. "Is something...wrong, sir?" \n\nGallagher just took a deep breath, shaking his head. "Just a little tired. On who's orders are you assigned here?" \n\n"Captain Santiago, Sir." There was that name again. \n\n"Santiago? Who the f-" \n\nGallagher felt a hand on his shoulder, turning, he saw the face of a man he'd never met before. Bronze skin, a thick moustache, and a jaw cut like diamond, all components of the enclave officer before him. His uniform was clad in a myriad of perfectly preserved medals, ribbons, and badges. "That would be me, Captain Santiago. I'm here to observe things up here in the Commonwealth, from now on, your orders will have to go through me." \n\nSo, this was it, the Enclave was putting the leash on him in the form of a permanent attache. Having decided that could take nothing else from Gallagher, they've usurped his authority, and how could he even stop it? Most of his influential officers were dead, and replaced by MacArthur lackeys. Gallagher just stiffly offered his hand, to shake."

Gallagher had grown an lopsided, poorly maintained beard and he was clad in a uniform now worn for far longer than it ought to have been. His iconic dress blues were stained, unevenly wrinkled, and had an unpleasant odour that the officer was absolutely numb to. \n\nHe'd mostly spend his time in one of three ways; listening to the radio, reminiscing over old entries on his terminal, and drinking. \n\nThose Enclave stooges were all too happy to keep Gallagher liquored up. He leaned back in his chair, grinding his teeth and staring angrily up at the ceiling, muttering aloud to himself. \n\n"Stupid Gallagher, can't stop us if he's toasted." \n\n"Dumb bastard Gallagher, do us a favor if he drinks himself to death!" \n\nHis anger at these imaginary Enclave officers swelled, finally settling on the worst of them all. \n\n"That prick Santiago...I'll show 'em.""

The pistol was a trophy piece he'd gotten off a particularly dangerous raider chief -the elegantly named Mouf- during a skirmish in his younger years. \n\nThe gun hadn't been fired once since the day he'd laid his hands on it. It almost felt like a violation to slip a loaded magazine in, but it clicked into place just as easily as it would have in any other gun. \n\nGallagher -poorly- concealed it in the front of his uniform jacket, not once taking his hand off the grip. \n\nHis heart raced as he marched out of his office, briskly moving towards the command center; had it been a month ago, Gallagher might have had reservations about a plan like this. Gallagher might have second guessed himself, mulled over questions like "Is this worth it?" "Is what I'm doing right?" \n\nThe horrible truth of the matter is that signing your family off to be shot is a completely and utterly liberating thing. Of course, the moral compass and sense of belonging it liberates you from is quickly replaced by choking grief and unrelenting sorrow. \n\nThe Command Room was close now, just around the corner.

They'd begun to fire before he'd even been able to aim his own weapon. \n\nShreds of dirtied blue cloth, specks of grime, and a surprisingly small amount of blood were blown in front of his face. \n\nGallagher's was momentarily surprised at how little it actually hurt; maybe it was adrenaline, or maybe he was just numb. \n\nHe hadn't even realized he'd hit the floor until he saw the ceiling lights; their form slowly smeared, shifting from crisp luminescent rectangles to a formless ball of light that hovered above him ambivalently. \n\nGallagher rolled onto his side, releasing a breath he'd been holding onto for...well, he wasn't sure how long. In his fogged mind he mentally cursed the people who'd gotten him into this mess. Santiago, the Enclave, the Wasteland, and himself. Mostly himself. \n\nGallagher was tired, he figured that whatever mess he was in now, he'd have to get himself out of it tomorrow. But for now, he was just very tired; so, he would sleep."

Looking back at the white sheet hanging behind him he regarded the image cast onto it with feeling of deep disgust. The MacArthur seal. \n\n"I'll keep it brief. I've got bad news." Gallagher paused, letting the murmurs of the crowd settle down as he started to pace back and forth in front of the projector. "Last night I received a communique from MacArthur demanding the immediate liquidation of all ghouls within our ranks." \n\nThat made everybody sit up straight. Four dozen pairs of eyes watched Gallagher with hawk-like attention, he was quick to reassure them. "I'm not going to go through with it, but you know as well as I do that a simple "no thanks" won't cut it. We have to fight back, and soon." \n\nGallagher pointed to the few orderlies he'd called to the meeting, snapping his fingers.

If not for the prevalence of government fans, the crowd may be much more volatile than it already is. Since the dissolution of the previous local governments, the business of unlicensed and illegal drug creation and vending has continued to grow.\n\nIn resolving this tumultuous affair, two candidates have been nominated by the Reformer and Unionist parties. For the Reformers, a ghoul Aztec-turned-Gente de Sol soldier by the name of Gubernia Izquierda. Running on the campaign of restoring rights to all, as per an ancient collection of documents she claims to have come across between her time as an Aztec and as a soldier in Gente de Sol. Izquierda wishes to establish a "United States of Mexico", seeking to open the Sonoran Commonwealth to all, and to extend the currently limited rights of many non-humans.\n\nIzquierda may have lofty ambitions, but her lack of response to the drug and cartel crisis has earned her criticism from her Unionist opponent, former Chief of the NCR Rangers, Josh Hanlon. Hanlon, in contrast to Izquierda's political goals, seeks to instate a system of stricter government regulation and law enforcement throughout the Commonwealth. His main goal is to reform the ancient institution known as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which he will seek to discuss and approve in Congress as soon as possible. Humanitarian organizations have criticized Hanlon's ideas of bringing another form of NCR Rangers to impose their authority on a non-NCR territory, but Hanlon insists they will only be for the safety and security of the Sonoran Commonwealth.\n\nElection time is short, so make your way to the election center today and vote!\n\nEadie Malone\n\nFederalist Times"

Hanlon has refused to give comment on if he meant this literally.\n\nTrue to his word, Hanlon, almost immediately after finishing his speech, was seen climbing into a fighter jet to be transported to Congress, where he gave a rousing speech on the benefits of reforming the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation). In a neck-and-neck vote, a Unionist senator broke the tie, with Hanlon receiving legislation and funding for a test of the bureau.\n\nUpholding another campaign promise, Hanlon refurbished a ramshackle office building into a soon-to-be officiated bureau building. Organizing the militias and individual armed citizens who were not officers in the Commonwealth Armed Forces into a new force, which he deems the "Sonoran Rangers". While their purpose as of yet is unknown, speculation from those closely affiliated with the bureau reveals that their focus is on exterminating and eliminating drug use and drug manufacturing in the whole of the Sonoran Commonwealth.\n\nWhile it has certainly been a busy day for Hanlon and the Sonoran Commonwealth, things have progressed faster than they ever have for this tiny corner of the yet-to-be-civilized world.\n\nEadie Malone\n\nFederalist Times"

Over the course of the next week the two agents embedded themselves into the crew, partaking in the crew's criminal activity of robbery, drug dealing, and more.

Well unlike the House, the bill was left in limbo as the vote was directly fifty fifty with surprising cross party support bought the bill a  chance. However, due to the most recently ratified Constitution, Johnson as the Governor-General would now have to cast the tie breaking vote. The mumbles were widespread as Johnson entered the chambers.

As expected, the Old World Party candidate, Grant C.

Anton Flynn of Flynn Family Farms was first to comment on the election, appearing on the recently-renamed Commonwealth Radio Hour to give his thoughts: "I cannot speak to my fellows in the Chain Links, but I for one am appalled that such a man was elected to office." He signed off on the program with a cryptic "I'll see to it that he isn't Governor for long". \n\nWhether or not Calhoun is truly the inept candidate many make him out to be, or a legitimate figure who can navigate through the political world to lead the Western Commonwealth to a brighter future is unknown.

The group, hereinafter referred to as "The Discordant," sought to incite civil unrest and spark a potential civil war, posing a significant threat to the nation's stability.\n\nInvestigative Details:\nTarget Identification: The Discordant was identified as an extremist organization comprising dissidents and radicalized elements with a common goal to disrupt the democratic fabric of the nation after the election of the Governor. Their intentions were to create chaos, sow seeds of discord, and overthrow the legitimate government.\n\nLeader Identification: Through surveillance and intelligence gathering, the leader of The Discordant was identified as Anton Flynn, a charismatic and radical individual known for their ability to manipulate followers. Flynn had managed to attract a sizeable following, which posed a grave concern to national security.\n\nOperational Strategies: The Discordant employed covert means to evade detection, communicating through encrypted channels and clandestine meetings. Their activities included dissemination of anti-government propaganda, recruitment of disillusioned citizens, and stockpiling of weapons for potential insurrection. Brotherhood of Steel resources were also recovered on the scene.\n\nOutcome: The operation resulted in a swift and decisive take-down of The Discordant.

Once dominated by raider gangs that presented themselves as traders, the area is now being considered for diplomatic missions to the Central American region of the Americas. For those unaware, Central America, otherwise known as Mexico, is the area between our great New American Commonwealth that stands between us and the savagery of communism and anarchism that is speculated to lie within South America.\n\nUpon flying in on his newly built aircraft, the "Bear Ship Enterprise", Hayes landed at a hastily constructed Tijuana airstrip to a crowd of adoring fans. Though temperatures were over 120 degrees, Hayes stepped out with his overcoat and pince-nez spectacles shielding him from the hot Bajan sun. Meetings with local officials, formerly of both the time of independent Baja and the Bajan State, were short, yet memorable, with each meeting ending with hearty laughs and smiles from both the Governor and those he conversed with.\n\nThe only figure missing from this journey is one Anton Flynn, who has been declared missing since a tragic fire engulfed Flynn Family Farms earlier this year. Rumours persist that Flynn remains alive, simply living in a Pre-War undersea utopia. However, neither the Governor or any law enforcement have given any formal statements on Flynn or other figures from the Chain Links political party.

Wylld had gone through much of the same, a man who did his best with what he had, seeking to change his colleagues for the better, even if futilely so.\n\nWith the Brotherhood and Followers hunted down like dogs, Calhoun had used all political power available as Governor to limit Commonwealth forces from investigating and harassing suspected associates. Things seemed stable for a time, until one day he received an encrypted signal from a Brotherhood operative pleading that an escape route out of California be established along the Flynn Family Farm for loyalists stranded in Maxson. As Calhoun and Wylld awaited for the turncoat in the dead of night however, the two were greeted by a man dressed head to toe in fine pre-war garments. "Governor, Elder! A surprise to see you here! Tell me, do you usually peruse Brotherhood bunkers in the dead of night, or are you just preparing another rescue operation for these poor saps?" A revolver emerged from the man's overcoat. "Anton I. Flynn, at your service. But you already know who I am. What you might not know is my what I've been up to." He glanced over their shoulders.\n\nExplosions began erupting from across the farm, as well as across the horizon to the East.

I lured you here exploiting your soft spot for the Brotherhood - an unfortunate trait, I should add.

So while your tiny bastion of so-called freedom falls apart, I'll be basking in the sun. You take the fall, and the debt is paid."

These engineers, alongside a fresh cohort of local Canadian counterparts, would become the founding fathers of Project Solaris. The mansion would soon become home to the latest advancements in military robotics, outfitted to survive the harsh conditions of the Anchorage frontline in order to replenish the starving troops knee-deep in Alaska’s brutal blizzards. However, just as the assembly lines began to whistle and hum, so too would the nuclear ornaments of the Great War.\n\nAs Uncle Sam turned to radioactive dust, the remnants of Project Solaris were faced with the challenges of surviving without the government’s tab, hailing in a period of mass famines and sickly subsistence known as the Long Winter. Only upon its thawing did the remains of Project Solaris emerge as something new, the League of Human Advancement, a group hell-bent on putting the world back together one vacuum tube at a time. Their first objective would be finding a use for their former supply bots, retrofitting them for farm labor. With the blessing of the newly established Sixth Brigade Commission, these farmer bots would turn the surrounding permafrost into fields of razorgrain. In doing so, they supplied Red Deer with a much-welcome source of sustenance, slowly easing the famine ravaging the city. However, not all their projects were as squeaky-clean.\n\nDeep within the League’s mansion, the engineers worked around the clock, tirelessly coding and refurbishing ancient vacuum tubes. In the basement, empty jars are filled with an unknown liquid while terminal monitors are stacked to the ceiling. The head of the League makes his way to a central control panel, as the stacked wall of terminal screens flicker to life, bathing the room in a pale green hue. Another flip is switched on the control panel, screeching the speakers to life while the green light from the screens forms into audio waves matching the echoing speakers.

Tens maybe even hundreds of these steel birds circle the airport skyline begging the control tower to land. As the pilots beg for landing space, the cries of the wounded are heard in the background. Gallagher with little option commands all available space in Red Deer to be opened for landing zones. Rooftops, ancient parking lots, and even the new parks are quickly converted into makeshift landing pads. Enclave soldiers race around the city putting out fires of damaged vertibirds.
