  COM_jack_johnson_name: "Jack Johnson"
  COM_JACK_JOHHSON_DESC: "Ask Corporal Johnson, and he'll tell you he's been fighting the good fight since before the bombs fell. Ask the Canadians, and they'll call him a brigand who wears the flag of their oppressors, a monster who should join America in the grave. Johnson's seen it all - first CPF schism, the fall of the Mounties, and the flashes in the Northern Lights. But one thing's clear - the man who claims to be the Last American will oppose the Canadian People's Front until his dying breath."
  COM_JACK_JOHNSON_DESC_1: "Ask Corporal Johnson, and he'll tell you that he has been fighting the good fight since before the bombs fell. Ask the communists, and they'll call him a devil cladded in stripes and stars. Ask the Enclave, and they'll call him a traitor, China's greatest friend. Ask the American people, and they'll say he is their hero, a man who had lost himself in the bottle, but had found the light. There was once an Uncle Sam that carried the flag, but now it's Uncle Johnson who shall reunite the union!"

  COM_micheal_woods_name: "Micheal Woods"
  COM_MICHEAL_WOODS_DESC: "Being beaten by snow, communists, and even those we once thought of as friends, Micheal Woods still stands. The most unlikely of leaders, Woods is a descendent of the original Sixth Brigade. Having spent most of his early years growing strong on the farm, hearing stories from his elders about the great republic they had fought for. Now, the legacy of the stars and stripes fall upon his shoulders. Old Glory may be gone, but its Unknown Soldier still puts on a good fight!"

  COM_captain_gallagher_name: "Captain Gallagher"
  COM_secretary_gallagher_name: "Secretary Gallagher"
  COM_SECRETARY_GALLAGHER_DESC: "Born in the slums of Red Deer, Secretary Gallagher was once a forgotten soul along with the many other orphans on the street. However, he was hand picked by the old Ghoul officers to carry the torch of a lost world. For as long as he can remember, Gallagher was already carrying a rifle and wearing a uniform. Rising through the ranks as the gold star soldier, soon he was the head of all National Guard units in Red Deer. Now, the rising star of the Commonwealth has taken the reins of the nation. Steering the American people into the future and not into the bottle."

  COM_enclave_admin_name: "Enclave Military Administration"
  COM_ENCLAVE_ADMIN_DESC: "Following the death of Gallagher, the Enclave became the sole faction with any real influence in the Commonwealth. With most of the acting officers loyal to MacArthur, there was nobody to claim Gallagher's old position.\n\n After a brief period of martial law, the administration shifted to a permanent military government until the day annexation can be arranged."
