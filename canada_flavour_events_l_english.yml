  # Canadian Occupation Day
  canadaflavour.1.t:0 "The Day of Infamy"
  canadaflavour.1.d:0 "Today, all who call themselves Canadians mourn the greatest tragedy of our history-- the day that those we considered our closest brothers betrayed us, and stole our freedom. The American Invasion of Canada over 200 years ago was a brutal and bloody affair that none were spared from. Today, we remember those that were taken from us by the atrocities of the invaders, and remember the proud nation that once set an example to the rest of the world. \n\nO Canada, who was slain unjustly by the hand of tyrants, shall you ever rest in peace and in our memories."
