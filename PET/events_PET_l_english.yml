  nf_event_pet.1.d:0 "The children of the Education Center fell quiet as a man, clad in the knee-length grey cloak and long chains of smooth, tempered glass emblematic of the Anholists entered the classroom. The Center’s Chief Educator, a stout, dark-haired woman who looked to have spent too much time staring into the sun, swept her stern gaze across the crowd to weed out any troublemakers as the holy man approached the front of the room. \n “Greetings all, I hope this message finds you well -” he began, pushing some of his curly hair out of his eyes. \n “I stand before you fine group of imploiyees to impart you with the most profitable information you may yet hear during your kariir.” \n He paused to allow for his words to sink in for a moment before continuing, “The First B’aykruptsi, the crash that befell our ancestors, was not a proprietary occurrence, and we must all take up the mantle to prove our people worthy of the Zheiroldas’ profits.” \n Before the Chief Educator could reach their row, a rowdy child shouted out: “But what even is B’aykruptsi?” \n The robed man smiled and said, “What an excellent correspondence -” before leaning in over his podium like he was sharing a secret, “- B’aykruptsi is the worst thing that could ever happen to the Kompenni, or anyone... ever.” \n He paused again, allowing his words to sweep over the crowd of imploiyees. Once he was satisfied that the group was sufficiently enraptured by his words, he posed another question: \n “Now, who wants to make sure there isn’t another B’aykruptsi?”"

  nf_event_pet.2.d:0 "The silent night was broken by the crackling of the bonfire, El Seeyo and dozens of others from the tribe hefting piles of firewood into the blaze. Murmurs swept through the crowd of hundreds that had gathered at El Seeyo’s request, heads turning to try and locate why they had all been summoned away from their nightly tasks. After a few minutes of confusion, El Seeyo took his place at the center of the gathering, his hulking figure made more imposing by the framing of the fire behind him. \n “Listen up!” He bellowed into the crowd, commanding attention before revealing a lanky woman who emerged from his shadow, \n “Things are gonna change soon, so don’t mess it up, or else we all dead!” \n With that enigmatic message, El Seeyo ceded the floor to the newcomer. The glass chains the woman wore made it appear as though she were wreathed in fire as she stood before the tribe, holding her head high. \n “Greetings all, I hope this message finds you well.” She began, her deep voice reverberating through the crowd over the clamor of the bonfire. “In the coming weeks, we will be beginning new production initiatives that will require the complete dedication of every new hire and imploiyee available.” \n She continued, “El Bord has agreed that the great machines that occupy our market share are key assets that should be utilized to their full potential, and that our primary focus should be on their restoration.” \n The raising of a timid hand near the front of the audience made the woman pause, gesturing for the crowd to part which revealed a rather stout imploiyee that was nearing hiring age. “Greetings miss… I don’t mean to be insubordinate, but…” the imploiyee’s eyes flicked nervously to El Seeyo, who nodded for him to continue. “...well, we already spend a lotta time doing other things every day, why should we do this instead of fishing or somethin?” \n “I appreciate your response, kind imp. I will thus remind you all that El Bord, with the help of El Seeyo, are those who brought us this time of prosperity and opportunity. They are the descendants of those devout and blessed few that survived the First B’aykruptsi, and hold knowledge conferred by the Zheiroldas that is beyond the best of us. El Bord united to lead us because they know what is best, every moment they have is put into making sure that their decisions are what is best for the Kompenni and tribe.” \n The crowd erupted in a strange combination of cheers and whispers, the woman eventually raising a hand to quiet them down before finishing, “If you have further questions you would like to pose to myself or El Bord, I would suggest you submit a Request for Comment next gathering.”"

  nf_event_pet.3.d:0 "El Seeyo squeezed into the tiny chair at the front of the massive desk belonging to the Anholiest, the man responsible for heading the Anholist order. Silence reigned for what felt like hours until the heavyset priest finally finished scanning through the piles of paper surrounding him. \n “Thank you for coming, El Seeyo, there are a great many things to discuss.” the Anholiest’s high, nasal voice nearly made El Seeyo wince as it bounced around the room. \n “Of course, ‘nholiest.” El Seeyo mumbled out before straightening his posture and meeting the eyes of the old priest. “I’m here t’ serve the Zheiroldas, and ya said they got somethin’ fer me?” \n “Unfortunately yes, you’re quite right - and it is definitely something.” The Anholiest shifted in his rather luxurious chair, pulling a stack of papers with lines and numbers on them. Laying them out in front of El Seeyo, the priest let out a great sigh before continuing, \n “As you can see, the trends are starting to go down, and all of us that have had the honor to be spoken to by the Zheiroldas have agreed that the future holds many struggles for us.” \n El Seeyo was quiet, his face hardening as he stared intently at the papers trying to decipher their meaning. “Life has always b’n hard, but it has b’n less hard since you and El Bord showed up,” the Anholiest silently gave a small smile as El Seeyo composed his next thought, “and now I’m responsible fer alla’ya’s safety. What can I do?” \n “Well, I hate to ask this of you and your people, El Seeyo, but we may be facing another B’aykruptsi within our Fixxelear, so we need you to do everything you and your people can during this coming Quarter...”"

  nf_event_pet.4.d:0 "Hundreds of people surrounded the collapsed structure, a mangle of concrete and rebar that the Anholists revered as the gravesite of their saintly founders. Here their connection to the Zheiroldas is the strongest, and only the Anholiest, his most trusted advisors, and El Seeyo are ever allowed to enter. El Seeyo and the Anholiest were stoic as their procession handed out glass beads in geometric shapes to the crowd, stepping ever closer to the carved-out crypt entrance. The site itself was wreathed in firelight, the crowd’s beads shining alongside the full moon sitting high in the clear night sky.\nAfter nearly twenty minutes El Seeyo stood at the top of the steps, carved intricately from concrete by dedicated Anholists over the many years, and stared into the dark void ahead. He paused a moment, before turning to face the crowd with a triumphant smile.\n”Friends, family, my tribe, we have long awaited this moment. We have struggled against many a foe and sacrificed much to stand before this precipice…” He paused for a moment, wracking his brain for the rest of the speech he had memorized.\n”...and I have great faith in our achievements, our people, and El Bord. I am certain that the Zheiroldas will see you as I see you all: productive, profitable hires and imploiyees that are willing to give all you have for the Zheiroldas’ profits. Do not worry, tonight is not a night for fear and misery, but a night for celebration!” El Seeyo bellowed to the heavens, a cheer erupting from the crowd.\nEl Seeyo’s grin never faltered as he descended into the holy structure, the Anholiest saying a few words of prayer before following. El Seeyo confidently strode into the communion chamber, placing his Quarterly Report on the table next to the Transmission Machine. He secured himself to the chair that would allow the Zheiroldas to speak through him, and allowed the Anholiest to attach the wires that would translate the Zheiroldas’ holy words.\n”Are you ready?” The Anholiest asked, his assistants rushing around the room to ensure that all was prepared to receive the Anwell Report.\nEl Seeyo took a deep breath and nodded, reaching a state of zen as the Anholiest injected the Divining Fluid. El Seeyo's consciousness faded, only returning hours later as he heard the Anholiest exclaim:"

Lost in thought as he walked the dim halls, El Seeyo missed the prayer room where the communion would take place. Thankfully the Anholiest steered him into the right room, taking the scroll that contained the Quarterly Report from El Seeyo and handing it to one of the Anholists that had followed them down into the ruin. Cold sweat ran down El Seeyo’s back as the Anholiest sat him in the Connective Throne, attaching various wires to El Seeyo’s body as his heart hammered in his chest.\n”Are you ready?” The Anholiest asked, gaze looking for hesitance in El Seeyo’s eyes.\nEl Seeyo just closed his eyes and rapidly nodded, clenching his fists. The Divining Fluid took longer than usual to work its magic, and El Seeyo faded in and out of consciousness multiple times. After what felt like days he eventually woke, nauseous and exhausted, to the sound of a voice saying:"
