  STN_PIERRE_SOLOMON_NAME: "Pierre Solomon"
  STN_PIERRE_SOLOMON_DESC: "A swindler by trade Pierre, if that really is his name, has proven to be much like a cockroach. Through several suspicious deaths Pierre managed to become the Electorate of Warman and Grandora separately, this strange power base all but guaranteed his victory. Yet still there exists rumours of fraud. Pierre has attempted to recently move past his schmuck past and drag the Electorate into the future, whether they like it or not."
  STN_loris_name:0 "Loris Shrike"
  STN_loris_advisor_desc:0 "To "win" the Raffle in Stoon is perhaps the worst news one can receive. No one has any illusions about the fate the befalls those dragged away to the aristocrats' feasts, and Loris's fate was all but sealed the moment her name was drawn. The only thing standing between her and her grisly end was a desperate plea: they couldn't eat her, not while she had so much more to offer in life. \n\nAfter all, no one can put guns together like she can, or so she claimed. And when chance brought her cries to Pierre's ears and she was put to the test, it was true. Repairs, upgrades, or entirely new constructions, the firearms are as fine as armory salvage. So now Loris spends her days building custom arms for Stoon's more influential citizens, knowing the day she fails to deliver a masterpiece is the day they take her down to the kitchens to fulfill her allotted end."

  STN_leshy_name:0 "Leshy"
  STN_jean_name:0 "Jean Mangeurde"
  STN_jean_advisor_desc:0 "The upper echelons of Stoon society is ravenous in its appetite for new dishes, and none serve them better than Jean Mangeurde. The head chef of the Stoon's kitchens, Jean has practiced tirelessly with every ingredient he can acquire; not least of all, human flesh. Every preparation and seasoning that can be tested with it, he has tried. Anything to keep the aristocrats happy for one more meal. Not for his position mind you, or all the benefits it brings him. No, Jean is an artist, a true chef, and his pride will not allow him to slack in his quest to craft the finest delicacy that can be wrought with human hands. Or made out of them."

  STN_argo_name:0 "Argo Beldam"
  STN_argo_advisor_desc:0 "Argo never wanted to be a knight. Violence wasn't his idea of a future. But the pressures of his parents and of society gave him no out, and so he took up the life presented to him.\n\nArgo never wanted to go into exile. Abandoning his home, to never see it again, was the last thing he could imagine. But the demands of the bureaucrats were law, and so he walked out of Manitoban land with the rest of the Lettermen.\n\nArgo never wanted to watch his brothers and sisters die pointless deaths. They were what little link he had left to his lost life in the Kingdom. But the violence of the Electorals is insatiable, and it was hard enough to keep himself alive with threats on every side.\n\nArgo Bedlam is very much tired of what others want, what the world wants. So his sword now swings for his own desires alone, caring not for who leads Stoon, but what they can offer him."

  STN_Dr_Toboggan_name:0 "Dr. Toboggan"
  STN_Dr_Toboggan_advisor_desc:0 "For Dr. Toboggan, PhD Pending, the road to caretaker of the Asylum began over a hundred years ago, when he saw the Cathedral of Happiness go the way of the World - burned away in nuclear fire. As the Super Mutants scattered to the winds following that defeat, Toboggan has often found himself as a follower of larger bands; a tag along, attempting to give his more level headed advice to his fellow mutants and keeping watch over those who struggled with the loss of Unity.\n\nHis long journey to Stoon nearly stopped in Wyoming, as his current pack under Mogul began settling down there. But when a sizable group of Nightkin announced they were continuing northward following a new lead on FEV, he couldn't stop himself from going to keep watch over them. While he had long since abandoned use of stealth boys, their effects on the minds of his fellows had long since become as pronounced as the purple of their skin.\n\nBirch Hills Insane Asylum was to be a place of healing for all the super mutants suffering, a place to rest on the doorsteps of the MANIFEST supplies of FEV they had tracked down in Canada. Filled with pre-war text books on psychology and surrounded by sturdy walls, it would make a secure home to study the Nightkin's accumulated ailments. Yet as the Dandies have hijacked his work for their own terrible ends, he's been forced to divide his days between helping his charges and keeping them from the chopping block..."
  STN_life_name:0 "Life McMillan"
  STN_life_advisor_desc:0 "Once members of the same elite Nightkin squad in the Master's Army, Life, Liberty and The Pursuit have stuck together following the fall of Unity and watched each other's backs against humans and mutants alike. Stuck in Dr. Toboggan's Asylum, listening to the same radio channels as General Freedom, they were the first to join him in embracing the ideals of a lost country.\n\nLife McMillan was the leader of the squad, and the one most responsible for keeping them together. Even as others fell or fled, McMillan kept them moving forward, following the trail blazed by other nightkin looking for new sources of FEV further and further north.\n\nThe time in the asylum affected them all differently. Taking the name Life from a line on the radio, McMillan tries to stay away from the fighting now. Instead, he believes that as the Master gave life to them, he should cultivate stronger forms of life to survive the wastes if FEV can no longer be found. He spends his days trying to raise plants and animals better adapted to their surroundings. Dr. Toboggan won't sign off on letting him raise a pack of normies, for some reason."
  STN_liberty_name:0 "Liberty Belle"
  STN_liberty_advisor_desc:0 "Once members of the same elite Nightkin squad in the Master's Army, Life, Liberty and The Pursuit have stuck together following the fall of Unity and watched each other's backs against humans and mutants alike. Stuck in Dr. Toboggan's Asylum, listening to the same radio channels as General Freedom, they were the first to join him in embracing the ideals of a lost country.\n\nThe Fall of the Master was especially hard on Belle, who gained her current name from a terrible habit she picked up while wandering east: ringing like a bell whenever someone spotted her. Even if she was in a stealth field. Effectively removing her from raids on normie caravans, she began to look for ways to support their band with her other skills. At their camps she would reorganize their supplies, and keep their gear functional despite the ravages of sand and time.\n\nThe time in the asylum affected them all differently. While she listened to the radio as intently as Life and Pursuit, it was a pre-war propaganda poster that brought her around to their line of thinking. Plastered upon it was her new found namesake: the statue of Liberty, a 151 foot tall green woman that the nation of old must have given reverence to. Dressed in similar robes, she attempts to share both her knowledge of logistics and her worship of the Green Giant of the East, under whom both man and mutant can be free."
  STN_pursuit_name:0 "The Pursuit"
  STN_pursuit_advisor_desc:0 "Once members of the same elite Nightkin squad in the Master's Army, Life, Liberty and The Pursuit have stuck together following the fall of Unity and watched each other's backs against humans and mutants alike. Stuck in Dr. Toboggan's Asylum, listening to the same radio channels as General Freedom, they were the first to join him in embracing the ideals of a lost country.\n\nWhatever name the Pursuit had in Unity is now lost to anyone but McMillan and Belle: even the Pursuit no longer recalls it. The stealthiest member of the team, the Pursuit has always been a natural hunter of the wastes. As such, Belle and McMillan would often give him their spare stealth boys as his burned out, exacerbating his eccentricities.\n\nThe time in the asylum affected them all differently. Taking the name The Pursuit from a line on the radio, he believes that "Happiness" is just another target to be tracked down and run to ground. Where it is, exactly, he hasn't yet figured out, but he knows he's getting closer by the day."

  nf_stn.1.t:0 "A Nation of Cannibals"
  nf_stn.1.d:0 "In the winding alleys of Stoon lay many dejected men and women, their lives spent rotting away in Dundurn factories and steel mills. As the wheels of industry turn, these people will be left behind in favor of a new generation. Such is the succession of business. \n\nThose that were not conquered by the fires of forward-thinking men fell victim to the grand raffles: a dreadful affair that determined who was to be a feast for their neighbors. Blood ran in the streets of Stoon just as much as rainwater did, and though it was not gnashing teeth that left their mark anymore, that same spirit of the hunt flowed through them all. Those lucky enough to be granted a mercy token would be spared in a raffle, their meaningless lives allowed to continue plinking on without being a meal for the nobles. \n\nStoon was a city of blood-drinkers under the Dandelion Society, and they wore that title proudly. The other Electors hated them for it, but they knew that disagreeing with the nobility was a quick way to find a knife in your gut— or worse."
  nf_stn.1.a:0 "Many local facilities bowed to them out of fear."

  nf_stn.1.c.tt:0 "Two units of mercenaries will be spawned!"

  nf_stn.2.t:0 "The Whispers from Birch Hills"
  nf_stn.2.d:0 "But the raffles were not enough to feed the high echelons. To ring the populace further would jeopardize the nation's good sense of industry, or worse, make their dining habits even more vain. The last impression they needed to leave on the rest of the Electorate was content greed, no matter how true it may be. \n\nSo a deal was arranged with Dr. Shane Toboggan: a genius mutant and graduate from Chase University. His Nightkin Asylum at Birch Hills and its mutant populace became open to the Stoon nobles, who had a growing scheme amongst them: could mutants be effective livestock? With the amount of FEV that the Doctor claimed MANIFEST had stored, could they double or perhaps triple their meat value in any given head? \n\nThe possibilites made them froth at the mouth. But first, they would need to ensure the Asylum's welfare; after all, a lab without subjects was no good lab at all, and they would need to look into ways to break down their tough texture. \n\nGreen Meat, Blue Meat— whatever it would be, it would have to come from Birch Hills Insane Asylum."

  nf_stn.3.t:0 "Take Heed of Our... Responsibilities"
  nf_stn.3.d:0 "The Electorate was always a volatile place. Dundurn's machines rivalled that of pre-war tech magnates and their industrial barons held many stakes across The Katch, and Pleasantdale's experiments roamed the land without issue while their people drink their sorrows away in extravagant parties. \n\nDealing with them is no easy task, but it is not an impossiblity."

That's right, folks— I've seen it with my own two eyes. Gobbled the little bastard up like it was just a bag of roast brahmin, I'll tell you what! Now, I am not a violent mutant, but I do think that BABIES are SOVEREIGN CREATURES that deserve nothing but LOVE and RESPECT. Not being eaten! I've only ever eaten a handful of humans in my life, but unlike those DANDELION GUYS, I have limits. \n\nThey will eat your babies, too, if you keep lettin' them boss you around!

Who would see the coup through?"

Thousands of monsters masquerading as men fell to our rightousness across many decades— until the aristocrats of Manitoba turned their gaze to us and our Marshall. Lord Yorkton was forced to disband the Knights, for they feared a coup thanks to his grandeur, and we went from being heroes to exiles overnight. Despite all we had sacrificed, all we had given King and Country, we were forced to run from the very same home we threw ourselves upon the sword for. Now we dwell in our ancient enemies homelands, avoiding their gaze and making a living however we can. \n\nPierre Solomon thinks he can goad us into being his personal army; as if we were such a militia to be guided. No. We are Knights of Yorkton! We will stand for no evil. It is against our nature. \n\nWe shall make arrangements. Yes, indeed, we shall make arrangements. The King of Stoon shall learn what it means to taunt God's Chosen."

Soon, a move shall be made to retrieve him from the prison... But the matter of how remained heavy on Sir Griffin's mind."

  nf_stn.9.a:0 "So shiny..."

  nf_stn.10.t:0 "The Ballad of Sir Daniel"
  nf_stn.10.d:0 "The day had come! The wedding between Pierre Solomon of the Dandelion Society and Beya of the Old Tribes of Stoon was to be held within the Third Avenue United Church, just before dusk so that the moon's grace would fall upon the undoubtedly star-crossed lovers. \n\nAmong the festivities was the finest and most exquisite of pastries and drinks: wines aged within Whitecourt for decades and exotic little red-fern based cannolis surrounded an unusually tall seven-tiered cake. After the vows were exchanged and God had been witness to the unholy sanctimony, Sir Daniel of Wadena burst forth from the cake, his armor covered in its batter and frosting as he leapt outwards. \n\nPierre and the guests were too shocked to do anything as he merely trudged through cake-filled boots, grabbing Solomon firmly by the shoulder as he plunging his greatsword into the politician's black heart. \n\nJust as the nobles realized what was about to happen, the Lettermen guards turned on the guests, slicing through the cannibal nobility as a farmer would pluck wheat. By the time it was over, the walls and floors were covered in blood, and their Yorkton blues became Stoon scarlets."
  nf_stn.10.a:0 "Pierre got his just desserts!"

  nf_stn.11.t:0 "Hell Hath No Fury"
  nf_stn.11.d:0 "The day had come. \n\nDressed in the richest of bloodstained whites— for even such an occasion could not be spared the blood that flowed through the city— Beya walked down the aisle, heart beating like a steadied drum alongside her heels. Pierre's crooked face stared at her as though today was his triumph. Alas, he'd never know it wasn't his until it was too late, for it was as the priest began to ask for vows that Leshy tore through the stained glass adorning the church, leaning in and grappling at his guardsmen with crooked fangs. In an instant, Beya revealed her own blade, plunging it into Pierre's chest and tearing out his heart. The warriors of the old blood who Beya had assembled as her guests turned on the nobility, gutting them and staining the church in deep reds— their carnage led by her as she drank deeply of his heart's juices. \n\nSo it was, then, that the Old Blood had become new once again."
  nf_stn.11.a:0 "Nature takes its course."

  nf_stn.12.t:0 "A Wedding to Die For"
  nf_stn.12.d:0 "Despite the best hopes of the Lettermen and the Old Blood, Pierre had outplayed them by doing absolutely nothing at all— just the way he'd have it. The marriage went off without issue, Beya's family watching as she swore herself to a man who held no true love for her, in a building the Lettermen believed was theirs alone. \n\nPierre Solomon had finally acquired his power, and he had the recognition he needed. Now? Now came the fun part: cleaning up loose ends."

  nf_stn.16.d:0 "The Spectral Cabal has long since been a factor in the livelihood of the Electorate. Driven by vanity and a strange sense of religious pride, their controversies are outnumbered by their mysteries. Between their legendary Wolf God haunting the nightmares of those who frequent the Cabal's pools too frequently and the disgustingly vain use of Red Fern for personal gain, it wouldn't take much to justify cracking down on their chapels and ousting them for good. \n\nOn the other hand, however, their healing pools can be quite useful, and their parties have been greatly popular for a reason. Perhaps we could stand to gain favor by allowing them to continue operations?"

  nf_stn.18.d:0 "As Pleasantdale was secured and its horrors either contained or destroyed, Daniel felt a growing sense of resolution creep up over his back like goosebumps. After years trapped in Allan Hills Penitentiary, he felt like he was finally getting somewhere. The Knights of Saint George had crawled out of the garbage bin of history like a phoenix, and he yearned for a good night like he used to have. \n\nSo he returned home, to Wadena, where his cottage remained. His wife and daughters would surely be expecting him, after all. \n\nWhen he arrived, he felt his breath quiet and his chest tighten. It had been years. Would they even remember him? Would they care to? His thoughts were broken as the door opened, and there she was, just as beautiful as the day he had left her: Mary-Anne stared back with a look of what he thought was misplaced horror, but it did not waver as he opened his mouth. He hushed himself before he could string together a sentence. When he reached for her face, she took three steps back. \n\nIt was then that she gave him the truth. She had sold him and his residence out to Pariah Hawkmoon in exchange for money to fund their children's future. At that moment, his heart shattered into a cacophany of glass shards, and tears fell from his visor like rapid falls.. "

The Dundurn estate did everything in their power to disenfranchise and choke them out of power, but that has ceased to be a concern as of late. Though their relations with Manitoba haven't been the greatest, we both stand to benefit greatly from working together. Shall we see them as equals, or shall we remove them from this plane?"
  nf_stn.20.b:0 "We shall plead Yorkton for their knighthood!"

  nf_stn.21.d:0 "For decades, the smog clouded Dundurn from the grace of God. Our intervention has allowed the smokestacks to be silenced and for the workers to return to their homes. They celebrate their night away with their families, and we are left with nothing else to do but watch the sunset. \n\nAs for Sir Daniel of Wadena? Why, he watched the sunset by his lonesome.

They wanted him to discover a way to 'soften' the tissue of a mutant, so that they could somehow use the FEV to make more mutants, soften them up, and use them as exotic dinners for their cannibal parties.

As they gathered within old churches and banquet halls, their tongues twisted, new languages forming and blending as tribes merged. To this end, Saskatoon changed with its people, becoming S'Toon. Over time, as others adopted the name and western Canada devolved into its feudal states, it became Stoon: the seat of false governments and monsters alike. \n\nThough the blizzards have long since thinned, the desperation that drove so much of the populace to cannibalism had now become mere vanity.
