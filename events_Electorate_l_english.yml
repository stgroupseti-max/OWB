  nf_wak.4.d:0 "Dear Doktor Toboggan, \n\nHello sir, I hope this letter reaches you well. Word has reached me of continued raids on the hospital, I want to make sure you know my offer of sending some of my boys over to sort things out still stands. It pains my heart to hear of the raids, it makes me fear not only for my grandma, but also every other patient. My heart and mind will be with the Hospital forever. \n\nNow onto the topic of the evening, My dearest Grandma. I know you're doing all you can but.... I've recently been racked with an uneasy feeling on her wellbeing. I pray for news from you that could ease it, I heard of your idea to employ pet Deathclaws and while I'm no biologist, this sounds like a swell idea for all involved. With this letter is a box of goodies for both my Grandma and the general hospital population, tell me if they enjoy them and I'll keep sending them! \n\nYours sincerely, \nLugnut \n\n(P.S. Grandma Hilde sent me a drawing that looks like her pet being killed? I hope you can investigate this to make sure nothing bad is happening.)"
