  ### Leaders
  MCA_wesson_name:0 "Lucia Wesson"
  MCA_wesson_desc:0 "Lucia was born into one of the First Families, the elite of Montana. Her father was one of the first to welcome the Colonel, and Lucia was raised as an army brat alongside Martha. Lucia embraced both Enclave perfectionism and Northern self-confidence, and is one of the best shooters in Montana- if only she didn't ask so many questions. Lucia has the manners and ideals of a great lord, but will stand on her own and for her people."
  MCA_santiago_name:0 "Ellen Santiago"
  MCA_ellen_santiago_desc:0 "Colonel Santiago is a woman pulled in many directions. Having made it through the loss of the Rig and President Richardson, she has only taken on greater and greater responsibility through the years. She is answerable to the Secretary in Chicago, duty-bound to her faithful staff, entangled within the desires and ambitions of the First Families, as well as a proud mother who wants the best for her daughter. Balancing these many competing interests is a task many would buckle under, but the Colonel would like to think she's made of sterner stuff. The days to come will be her chance to prove it."
  MCA_santiago_name_martha:0 "Martha Santiago"
  MCA_santiago_desc_martha:0 "§4"I believe in America."§!\n\nThe Corporal is a true-blooded American, despite what some say of her heritage. A mutant could never look great in Advanced Power Armor, and her mother surely wouldn't consort with Wastelanders. Having grown up in the Rockies, Martha leads the most excellent Team October around the Wasteland solving practical problems. Missoula, Bozeman, MacArthur Air Force Base and more have a bright future with her around."
  mca_horrigan_ii:0 "Special Agent Johnson"
  mca_horrigan_ii_desc:0 "Special Agent Johnson is a true patriot, a man who volunteered for FEV exposure. The virus altered him, turning him into the perfect Enclave soldier that held far more focus on the Enclave's goals of rebuilding America. He even asks no questions and challenges no orders- alas that his methods can be somewhat brutal. No matter the leader of MacArthur, Johnson's true superior is the Secretary of thr Interior and the Board, whose directives he faithfully and violently fulfills."
  MCA_mason_salvatore:0 "Mason Salvatore"
  MCA_mason_salvatore_cultural_desc:0 "After Navarro's fall, the Salvatores' enemies attacked with a vengeance, forcing the family to flee. The Enclave brought them along when they fled east, and Mason has since managed to set up shop in Missoula. Some wonder why the Colonel tolerates Salvatore and his illicit connections, but she remembers how well those ties served out west."
  mca_markham_economic:0 "Abigail Markham"
  MCA_markham_economic_advisor_desc:0 "Abigail came to Montana from the Chicago Enclave. She started her career as a line worker in a truck plant, working her way up to become an operations manager. She took a particular liking to automation and analytics, and eventually decided to start something of her own. After facing harassment due to concerns about 'genetic purity,' she walked out of the truck plant with a top engineer and went west. Now she hopes to run Great Falls into MacArthur's workshop.\n\nSome say Abigail got the job when she offered ten trucks a month and the ability to produce, albeit in limited quantities, power armor. Others say she came west with secret instructions from the Secretary of the Interior. Whatever the rumors, none can deny that Great Falls is turning into a forge to rival the Pitt."
  MCA_zachary_name:0 "Corporal Callahan"
  MCA_zachary_desc:0 "§4"At some point, you've got to stop taking their word for it and decide for yourself. That, and it was either this or the Bahamas."§!\n\nCarl Callahan was a Eureka boy, having grown up surrounded by mercenaries. Having actually been an infant when the Oil Rig fell, his mother fled north, and soon he found himself growing up hearing over and over about the Enclave from the Granite Company. Rather than continue to dwell on a nostalgia not his, eat Mirelurk, and ply the mercenary trade, Callahan and some friends wanted something real from their lives. Then a crazy idea came to him, from stories told of how the Enclave fled east. One Hubologist cargo plane with a ton of extra fuel later, Corporal Callahan and Team Oscar now serve at MacArthur, trading adventerous stories with Team October about who's done the crazier stunts."
  Chapman_DESC:0 "Some rumors say that Chapman actually served with an Enclave detachment in Texas, but any notion is absurd. What is true is that he's a good soldier, and good soldiers follow orders. Chapman is devoted to ensuring the Enclave can extract everything it needs from Washington. If he ever regrets his harsh rule, he understands that Wastelanders' lives are a sacrifice he's willing to make."
  MCA_jackson_name:0 "Daniel Carter"
  MCA_jackson_desc:0 "§4"Just following orders, Ma'am."§!\n\nCarter was a teenager when his family fled east from Navarro, his mother dying during the journey. Rather than growing up to be a man of iron will and morals, he is instead a slimeball that ultimately knows how to do his job. Fitness regimen aside, don't expect him to grow a spine and do something he wasn't outright ordered to do."
  mca_soldier_officer:0 "Corporal Rudolf"
  # The Rest
  MCA_research_civilian_name:0 "Wilson Jacobson"
  MCA_research_civilian_desc:0 "§4"Sand and snow have enough similarities some old tricks can still work."§!\n\nJacobson has followed Ellen's command since the fall of the Oil Rig, despite being a weapons manufacturer instead of a soldier. Happy that his days of being on the run with a Wattz 2000 watching over the Colonel are over, he's since settled in to a position where larger weapons can do more work at less risk to the wielder. It'd suck if Team October fell to a prepared squad."
  MCA_ghoul_advisor_name:0 "Bethy Mangano"
  MCA_ghoul_advisor_desc:0 "§4"I've met some shitty smoothskins in my time. You are nothing new."§!\n\nBethy was born sometime in the 22nd century, never having known Pre-War America. What she did know was that she had a brain fit for applying mathematics to the realities of ranching and beyond. After getting trapped in a crater of nuclear waste by raiders, she swore to not waste her life upon escaping and, miraculously, not dying of cancer and radiation poisoning. She's a cynic towards both the Enclave and the Northern Commonwealth as a whole- the death of everyone she ever knew to old age has left her in a world she's not so sure is worth fighting for anymore."
  MCA_eric_pelletier_name:0 "Eric Pelletier"
  MCA_eric_pelletier_desc:0 "§4"Value is relative, and you're not valuable."§!\n\nSome say he knows how to cut through bullshit and that he can ensure anyone we trust to hold a gun will be able to hold a gun. Some say he values the creation of Americans through old-fashioned methods instead of cloning and that he does not believe in the sancticity of marriage. All we know is, is that he's Eric Pelletier."
  MCA_andrew_fleming_name:0 "Andrew Fleming"
  MCA_andrew_fleming_desc:0 "§4"Mutants know their place."§!\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has sent a man westwards to keep an eye on the settlement of veterans, ensuring they do so safely. To that end, Fleming has been empowered to deal with already-existing peoples to ensure that Americans aren't forced to huddle together in MacArthur AFB, Missoula, and Bozeman. After all, it'd sting if his own family were to suddenly get gutted by locals who refuse to accept liberation."
  MCA_army_chief_iii_name:0 "Morgan Blackson"
  MCA_army_chief_iii_desc:0 "§4"...I believe America needs this."§!\n\nBlackson was another survivor of Navarro, and wielded his Plasma Caster to great use in order to save the Colonel's followers many times. Ultimately, he chose to continue on to Chicago, and has done admirably in a command position since. He'd hoped to return to MacArthur one day, but probably never in quite this fashion."
  MCA_high_command_iii_name:0 "Rachel Murphy"
  MCA_high_command_iii_desc:0 "Murphy is one of the most prominent auxiliaries in the Enclave. Educated and trained as part of Project ONEIDA, Murphy rose swiftly through the auxiliaries' ranks. Although she is unlikely to ever become a woman of note in Chicago, out west she's had a chance to prove herself; and she still sees her family in Missoula on leave sometimes!"
  MCA_enclave_pilot_advisor_3_name:0 "Alistair Campbell"
  MCA_enclave_pilot_advisor_3_desc:0 "§4"There's better options that won't break us. Hell, they won't break Chicago!"§!\n\nAirman Campbell personally flew the Vertibird that was Ellen Santiago's personal command center during the trek eastwards, and it was his maps that brought to light MacArthur Air Force Base as an option. Having never seen Chicago, he is quite content to spend his days making sure the lean aerial operations of MacArthur could continue to see success, without being crippled by the needs of the Secretary of the Interior. Now could Team October stop wrecking their Vertibird's paint job?"
  MCA_blair_name:0 "Harold Blair"
  MCA_blair_desc:0 "§4"I know what the Colonel's up to. Not a fan."§!\n\n Blair is, in some ways, an exemplar of the typical Enclave officer. Uncompromising in his willingness to work with Wastelanders, reassignment to MacArthur led to a bit of a culture shock in how the First Families worked hand in hand with Americans. Rather than poison the water or plan to kill them all, Blair has instead chosen to ensure his fellow Americans are not lost in the line of duty. Every life is precious, but some are more precious than others."
  MCA_mccormick_name:0 "Alex McCormick"
  MCA_mccormick_desc:0 "§R"When we think of the poor Wastelanders, destroyed, murdered, bitten by serpents, visited by plagues, decimated by famine, butchered by each other, swallowed by the earth, frightened, cursed, starved, deceived, robbed and outraged, how thankful we should be that we are not the ones under the protection of the Brotherhood. No wonder that they long for slavery under the Enclave, and remembered with joy the glorious day when they exchanged masters. Compared with the Brotherhood, the Enclave is a benefactor, and the tyranny of the Enclave is freedom to those who suffered under the Washington Brotherhood and the Cause. It is impossible to conceive a more thoroughly despicable, hateful, and arrogant organization than the Brotherhood of Steel. They are without a redeeming feature. In the Wasteland of the post-War world they have no parallel. They, only, are never touched by agony and tears. They delight only in blood and pain. Human affections are naught to them. They care neither for love nor music, beauty nor joy. False friends, unjust judges, braggarts, hypocrites, tyrants, hateful, jealous, vain, revengeful, false in promise, honest in curse, suspicious, ignorant, changeable, infamous, hideous...."§!"
  MCA_jeffrey_sun_name:0 "Jeffrey Sun"
  MCA_jeffrey_sun_name_desc:0 "Originally responsible for water purification in Montana, Jeffrey is responsible for economic reconstruction due to personnel shortages. Criticized at times for wasting resources on Wastelanders, he and his team have made sure that the Enclave and America have enough men to fight on. Perhaps one day, he'll be able to see Old Glory flying proudly from sea to shining sea."
  MCA_graham_name:0 "Aaron Graham"
  MCA_graham_name_desc:0 "One of the only members of the Enclave's State Department, Graham is relied upon to engage in diplomacy with the outside world. Graham's exposure to the Wasteland has given him a more tolerant view than most, and his willingness to compromise makes him a bit of an outlier. Pushed to MacArthur due to a turf war with the Department of the Interior, who also asserts dominion over all relationships with the American Wasteland, Graham may yet prove useful to the Enclave."
  MCA_female_high_command_name:0 "Ally Bleu"
  MCA_female_high_command_desc:0 "§4"Believe it or not, we could defend ourselves before the Enclave showed up."§!\n\nAlly Bleu's mother was a Jackson, and she hasn't seen her since they left Missoula. Taking umbrage when her mother left with the rest of her kin, she coped by learning the trials and tribulations that Missoula had gone through since the Great War. So little had changed over the years that a lot of the methods of self-defense were just as relevant today as they were at the end of the 21st century, a factoid that has baffled her since."
  MCA_female_army_chief_name:0 "Janet Castillo"
  MCA_female_army_chief_desc:0 "§4"The anwer's as simple as it's ever been, Martha: shoot the bitch."§!\n\nJanet is the scion of one of the First Families, and thus became as close as sisters to Martha when they were growing up. Rather than join Team October however, Janet has instead had a knack for high-level preparation that has proven indispensible. This often takes the form of encouraging the most aggressive and swift approach, intending to take the opponent by surprise and refusing them any chance to react. Sometimes, this seems more like she has a death wish ever since her parents were turned into a kite by the Storm Mongers."
  MCA_maria_canavan_name:0 "Maria Canavan"
  MCA_maria_canavan_desc:0 "§4"We know what MacArthur needs, and we know what Chicago needs. It's all a simple balancing act, sweetie."§!\n\nCanavan arrived to act as an on-site advisor to MacArthur on when and how much more can regularly be shipped back to Chicago. Upon arrival, she recognized how strapped for capability MacArthur was, and that Chicago itself could make investments to get far more out of the North than they were currently getting. Ultimately, she isn't able to bargain for as much as she hoped, but it has come in handy. Not bad for a stuck-up who wishes to return east."
  MCA_enclave_pilot_advisor_2_name:0 "George Motier"
  MCA_enclave_pilot_advisor_2_name_desc:0 "George's family claims their heritage back to the days of the American Revolution. Raised in those ideals, he dreams of rebuilding the Great Experiment. But he harbors his own questions about the Enclave, even as he rose swiftly through their ranks... for George's family are one of the few in its ranks who still read the Bible. A dangerous, superstitious book, or one that will help save the Wasteland? For it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
  MCA_economic_advisor_2_name:0 "Sgt. O. Willis"
  MCA_economic_advisor_2_name_desc:0 "Some may mock Willis, but they learn the error of doing so when their rations arrive late and spoiled. Willis is one of the quartermasters for MacArthur, and plays a crucial role in keeping the Enclave's forces fed and supplied. His ability to haggle with the ranchers and farmers of Montana is nothing to sneer at, and he knows how to make a damn fine brahmin stew."
  MCA_journalist_name:0 "Thomas Cordova"
  MCA_journalist_desc:0 "§4"Get me pictures of Team October!"§!\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief of the Montana Patriot founded the paper when he was just a teenager whose parents had a rare working tractor freeing him from the farm. He has since expanded operations dramatically, sometimes with the help of the Colonel, and sometimes in direct opposition to her. Whatever his stance truly is, he's always willing to make sure Team October doesn't look bad."
  MCA_historian_name:0 "Jakob Kjølaas"
  MCA_historian_desc:0 "§4"The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy."§!\n\nHailing from the Twin Buttes, Kjølaas chose to study methods of mass defense (or, as others call it, the fate of warfare). Ultimately, Jakob has done his part well enough to ready others to defend themselves... even if his own library rarely speaks of things like Power Armor."
  MCA_advisor_fuel_ai_name:0 "Germanotta's Volkswagen"
  MCA_advisor_fuel_ai_desc:0 "§R"Born down in a dead man's town\n\nThe first kick I took was when I hit the ground\n\nYou end up like a dog that's been beat too much\n\n'Til you spend half your life just covering up, now...."§!"
  MCA_germanotta_rides:0 "The President's Car Rides"
  MCA_ecoomic_advisor_lack_of_resources_name:0 "Rancher Tanenbaum"
  MCA_ecoomic_advisor_lack_of_resources_desc:0 "§4"We didn't become better than those around us for nothing."§!\n\nThe Tanenbaums are one of the First Families of Missoula, and have been reaping the benefits of Enclave cooperation ever since that incident with Heaven's Gate in the 60s. Officially, Hudson Tanenbaum will only discuss how there is more and more meat, grain, and caps flowing through the Rockies. Behind closed doors, he comments on how he's not so worried about the raiders to the east in the plains, and that perhaps there should be preparation for a threat closer to home."
  MCA_geoff_cajigas_name:0 "Corporal Cajigas"
  MCA_geoff_cajigas_desc:0 "§4"For the last time, I know exactly what you've been up to. Fess up, or you'll be cleaning toilets with a toothbrush!"§!\n\nCorporal Cojigas has a reputation of a blowhard amongst MacArthur, getting annoyed at the slightest things not mentioned in a report. Unfortunately, Cojigas has found himself as the one coordinating a majority of radio communication operations in MacArthur, meaning he hears and sees way more than is healthy for anyone. If he wasn't so good at coordination, Santiago (both of them) would have sent him back to Chicago long ago, minus the Power Armor."
  MCA_vincent_advisor_name:0 "Vincent Kennedy"
  MCA_vincent_advisor_name_desc:0 "Not every scientist from the University of Chicago wants to develop biological weapons or new Power Armor. Researcher Kennedy is one such washout, a fool who volunteered to go west. Kennedy finds the Colonel's easygoing ways a welcome change from Chicago, and seeks to grow Pre-War riches in an artificial environment. They say he dreams of reviving the greatest and most legendary of all fruits.\n\n\n\nDurian."
  MCA_naval_advisor_name:0 "Captain O'Keefe"
  MCA_naval_advisor_name_desc:0 "They say that in the vast depths of the ocean, the Enclave still has some Pre-War vessels that can destroy cities. And then there's O'Keefe: a man who proves that even 200 years after a nuclear war, it is still possible to assign naval officers to Montana if they get drunk and crash into a cargo ship."
  MCA_pilot_advisor_name:0 "Michael Page"
  MCA_pilot_advisor_desc:0 "§4"Missile locked... and negated. Always nice to hit the target while strafing to the side."§!\n\nPage has had a strong record in both getting the most out of Vertbird fuel via clever maneuvers and making sure targets on the ground are unable to fire back. Back in Chicago, he wrote a lot of the user manuals and instructions on piloting Vertibirds, but put in a request to transfer west and work under an old friend, Colonel Santiago. It probably wasn't a coincidence that he separated from his wife at the time, but hey, he kept custody of the kids, and he'd rather they play in the snow outside Bozeman than in the streets outside of Chicago."
  MCA_scientist_advisor_name:0 "Sarah Michelle"
  MCA_scientist_advisor_desc:0 "§4"I can not only make your Power Armor better, I can make YOU better. Now call me Sam, dammit."§!\n\nSarah Michelle has worked on the improvement of Advanced Power Armor ever since seeing a set of X-01 Mark VI on a green terminal. Since then, the engineer has found a whole new environment where even that isn't necessarily a standard, and is now under the challenge of a lifetime to churn out Power Armor that a soldier can operate effectively on a much lesser budget. It's a wonderful distraction for Michelle, who prefers wearing a full body-covering protection suit even outside the workshop. Possibly related is there has been a regular request to change her legal first name to Sam, but it's been continuously denied by Chicago."
  MCA_jackson_advisor_name:0 "Mr. Neil Jackson"
  MCA_jackson_advisor_desc:0 "§9"Time has passed, and the fire within us was all-consuming. The memory of our slaughter wtill haunt us, fueling our determination to build forgiveness. We will never forget the bloodshed, and we will ensure that no one else does either."§!\n\nThe Jackson clan did not expect mercy from MacArthur, but the [MCA.GetName] and [MCA.GetLeader] will not go back on their word. The Jackson family will spend the rest of their lives trying to heal the damage they did on the plains east of the Rockies, a labor that few would be happy with. It is fortunate then that Neil and the rest of his clan accept this wholeheartedly. Missoula has now been left better than they found it, and even if their personal estate was not as pleasent as it once was, they can go home again. The Jacksons never stopped fighting, and they never will, but that drive is good for far more than mere raiding."
  mca_markham_economic:0 "Abigail Markham"
  MCA_markham_economic_advisor_desc:0 "Abigail came to Montana from the Chicago Enclave. She started her career as a line worker in a truck plant, working her way up to become an operations manager.

  mca_horrigan_iii_desc:0 "Surely you didn't think Special Agent Johnson was the *only* patriot from Chicago?"
  mnca_johannes_name:0 "Playwright Johannes"
  mnca_johannes_desc:0 "§0Me thought I saw my late espousèd Saint\n\nBrought to me like Alcestis from the grave,\n\nWhom Joves great Son to her glad Husband gave,\n\nRescu'd from death by force though pale and faint.\n\nMine as whom washt from spot of child-bed taint,\n\nPurification in the old Law did save,\n\nAnd such, as yet once more I trust to have\n\nFull sight of her in Heaven without restraint,\n\nCame vested all in white, pure as her mind:\n\nHer face was vail'd, yet to my fancied sight,\n\nLove, sweetness, goodness, in her person shin'd\n\nSo clear, as in no face with more delight.\n\nBut O as to embrace me she enclin'd\n\nI wak'd, she fled, and day brought back my night.§!"
