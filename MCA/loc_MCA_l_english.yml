  MCA_invite_eagle_rock:0 "The Lost Air Wing"
  MCA_invite_eagle_rock_desc:0 "Eagle Rock's rulers were once content to sit on their Pre-War riches, maintaining airships for profit. But their new ruler could find a use serving the Enclave, surely."
  MCA_eagle_rock:0 "Eagle Rock of the Ages"
  MCA_eagle_rock_desc:0 "While we are unlikely, at this time, to encourage Eagle Rock to join the Northern Commonwealth, they could be a valuable trading partner. Why not encourage their airships to ply the northern skies?"

  MCA_eyebot_reliance_desc:0 "To secure the vast wastes of the north, we need robotic little helpers. Chicago is glad to provide them, at a cost of course."

  MCA_ncr_ties:0 "The Other Great Democracy"
  MCA_ncr_ties_desc:0 "We've heard tell of another great republic to the south and west, devoted to our ideals- equal respect, representation, and protection under the laws of a just republic. Although the Enclave left them with a bad impression, perhaps it is time to reach out and make amends?"

  NCN_southern_outpost:0 "Salt Lake Salvage"
  NCN_southern_outpost_desc:0 "We thought our scouts were joking at first, but it seems that much of Utah is overrun by savages, raiders, and Mormon survivalists. Fortifying Salt Lake City is an crucial to ensuring the Enclave's interests are protected. You have your orders, Colonel."
  MCA_utah_buffer:0 "The Utah Incursion"
  MCA_utah_buffer_desc:0 "Embarrassingly, some of our troops have gotten lost in Utah. But they've revealed that the land has a surprising amount of raw materials, lightly defended. Perhaps it is time to go forth and see if there is anything of value?"

  MCA_lions_in_winter:0 "The Lions in Winter"
  MCA_lions_in_winter_desc:0 "Not everyone in the North wishes to rule through firepower or the ancient ways. It seems that this Old Country has a few heroes left, after all. Rather than work solely with the Wardens, let me tell you of an American who's been fighting since the Great War for Truth, Justice, the American Way. Even if his skin is falling off."

  MCA_hire_wardens:0 "Our Western Wardens"
  MCA_hire_wardens_desc:0 "Somehow, the remnants of a private military company survived the Great War- although their history suggests they are, frankly, well, terrible (like all ghouls), they may of yet be useful. Shall we pursue a treaty with them?"
  MCA_kill_midwest:0 "§PLET THIS BE OUR FINAL BATTLE§!"
  MCA_kill_midwest_desc:0 "It's time to face the Midwestern Chapter. We will help Chicago crush those abominations once and for all. Eventually. I mean, not today, obviously, the map hasn't been expanded yet."

  MCA_human_resources_desc:0 "One of the advantages of the North is its isolation. To that end, Chicago requests access to certain biological samples for further refinement. While there may be casualties among the Wasteland population, in the long run, the survivors shall thank us."

  MCA_nit:0 "Holding High Chapel"
  MCA_nit_desc:0 "Do you want to deal with cleaning up Utah? No? Neither do I. All the more reason to secure this region as a buffer zone."
  MCA_stampedeii:0 "Spokane Salvage"
  MCA_stampedeii_desc:0 "We must decide what to do with Spokane- but really, this will depend on who runs the territory. After all, we have nothing against Wastelanders who recognize the dangerous threat that mutants and ghouls pose."
  MCA_give_advisor:0 "Tales of the Granite Company"
  MCA_give_advisor_desc:0 "We've heard rumors that even out west, the dream never dies. Somehow, a survivor from Navarro has made his way west with a group of mercenaries, inspired by the promise of the Enclave."
  MCA_give_advisor_tt:0 "A salute to the brave boys who keep the Enclave active across the Wasteland, and welcome Corporal Callahan to the fold."
  MCA_fight_for_Freedom_forever:0 "The Dream Never Dies"
  MCA_fight_for_Freedom_forever_desc:0 " The Enclave claimed to be the last Americans, and they may well be the successors to the United States government. But the spirit of America is not found in a chain of succession. The spirit of America is found in those who will never give up on the nation's promise."
  MCA_nuka_break:0 "Standing Apart"
  MCA_nuka_break_desc:0 "The Enclave, The Canadians, and many other threats menace our new nation. If we are going to ensure we're left alone, we must find a way to deter any attackers."

  MCA_seat_on_board:0 "A Seat on the Board"
  MCA_seat_on_board_desc:0 "With the Brotherhood's destruction, we have an opportunity to explore our newfound access to the MIssouri. This will make our involvement in the Midwest much, much easier."

  MCA_airfield_havre:0 "P-25 Restoration"
  MCA_airfield_havre_desc:0 "Havre Air Force Station was a general surveillance radar station before the war, and home to some airfields designed for emergency landings. Although they've been largely stripped at this point, we can always use what's left."
  MCA_air_support:0 "Air Support!"
  MCA_air_support_desc:0 "Given our largely unopposed control of the skies, American troops can hold out when raiders and savages would pretend they are 'surrounded'.

  MCA_not_by_blood_alone:0 "Not By Blood Alone"
  MCA_not_by_blood_alone_desc:0 "There are those out east who think mutations are a matter of DNA and chromosomal damage. They are fools. Clearly, some fine Americans can be salvaged from the Wasteland, proven by their service to the state."
  MCA_rail_guns:0 "The Good Stuff"
  MCA_rail_guns_desc:0 "Gauss rifles are not as good as plasma weapons, perhaps; but they are easier to maintain in the wilderness and are still well above typical Wasteland fodder. And now we have enough, pursuant to negotiations, to deploy them more widely."
  MCA_apa_yay:0 "A Proper Uniform"
  MCA_apa_yay_desc:0 "Well, Brigadier, perhaps you've earned this after all. At this point, who could doubt that you're a real member of the Enclave, devoted to the cause?"

  MCA_origin:0 "Rebuilding America, Today!"
  MCA_origin_desc:0 "Once there was a nation that held that all men were created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\nThat nation was mauled in the Great War. But we in the Enclave will never stop fighting for the American people."
  MCA_the_base:0 "From a Base Into a Home"
  MCA_the_base_desc:0 "Once a string of bases across America connected the United States government together, and many of these held out until the fall of Navarro. These embers of patriotism were kindled by Santiago into a new light, which shall guard the Wastes while it burns."
  MCA_the_families:0 "The First Families"
  MCA_the_families_desc:0 "The bombs glanced Missoula during the Great War, so while the city starved, its buildings survived. Today the city is dominated by the First Families, survivors of those who planned properly for the bombs."
  MCA_advanced_special_forces_focus:0 "The Best Forces West of the Mississippi"
  MCA_advanced_special_forces_focus_desc:0 "Even without their Power Armor, MacArthur's forces are to be reckoned with. It wasn't the suits of armour that gave them victory at Sheboygan, after all."
  MCA_firearm_tech:0 "Study the Schematics"
  MCA_firearm_tech_desc:0 "Even if we can't build more Power Armor, there's much to learn from Chicago's technology."
  MCA_missoula_market:0 "The Missoula Market"
  MCA_missoula_market_desc:0 "Missoula's market is already the best in Montana. With some further renovations, it could be the largest as well."
  MCA_gibbonsville_outpost:0 "The Gibbonsville Outpost"
  MCA_gibbonsville_outpost_desc:0 "Gibbonsville has been abandoned since the Great War, but it still guards the routes from Idaho. With proper fortifications in the region we can cut Heaven's Gate off in the passes."
  MCA_macarthur_arsenal:0 "A Shipment from Chicago"
  MCA_macarthur_arsenal_desc:0 "Chicago will be glad to send more assistance out west, but that may come with an understandable request for more assistance with the Great Work. But aren't all Americans in this together?"

  MCA_sharecropper_refugees:0 "Down on the Farm"
  MCA_sharecropper_refugees_desc:0 "One of the best uses for our refugees is to work on the farms and ranches outside Missoula. We can help provide them a new life as employees of the First Families."
  MCA_cars_of_our_own:0 "Fund The Crow Trucking Company"
  MCA_cars_of_our_own_desc:0 "The heroes of Montana are the Crows, whose trucks connect the North's settlements. The Garage in Missoula produces a handful of trucks a month, but with proper investment, and Enclave engineering, we could double, or perhaps triple, that!\n\nThis will help not just the people of the North; it will also cement the Colonel's rule."
  MCA_anti_slavery_patrols:0 "Never Stop Fighting for the American People"
  MCA_anti_slavery_patrols_desc:0 "It is one of the greatest tragedies that so much of the Northern Commonwealth tolerates slavery. Whether they're 'servants' of Heaven's Gate, serfs of the Khan, or the Canadian proletariat, thousands outside our borders choke under bondage. We must open our hearts and settlements to them!"
  MCA_drill_the_army:0 "The Last Professional Army"
  MCA_drill_the_army_desc:0 "One advantage of §M[MCA.GetNameWithFlag]'s§! military force is that it is, by and large, still a trained military force. This gives us a rival over the rabble that surrounds our oasis of stability."
  MCA_old_depots:0 "The Survivalist Bunkers"
  MCA_old_depots_desc:0 "While some wonder why Colonel Santiago knew how to find the old survivalist bunkers, none can deny their value to the fighting men and women who keep watch over the region."
  MCA_bozeman_museum:0 "The Old Museum"
  MCA_bozeman_museum_desc:0 "Bozeman was once hold to the American Computer & Robotics Museum. At the time, these were obsolete artefacts. Today, these old devices are the Wasteland's cutting edge- and beyond."
  MCA_granite_company_home:0 "The New Home for Old Men"
  MCA_granite_company_home_desc:0 "A detachment of Enclave soldiers remained on the west coast as mercenaries, but perhaps it is time to call them home rather than waste their time serving the Salvatores or the Van Graffs. After all, we can think of no better men to garrison Granite Company than these fine fellows."
  MCA_advanced_construction:0 "To Rebuild the Old Ways"
  MCA_advanced_construction_desc:0 "There is no reason the people of Montana and Idaho must remain mired in poverty. And with proper incentives, that will change."
  MCA_mills:0 "Grain Mills"
  MCA_mills_desc:0 "The best way to promote the local economy is to encourage agricultural productivity. By establishing mills in in key towns, this can be the heart of industrialization and development."

  MCA_paper_please:0 "The Montana Patriot"
  MCA_paper_please_desc:0 "The Montana Patriot was established in Missoula a decade before the Enclave's arrival, but came to serve a valuable role giving the truth straight from the Colonel's office. With funding grants, we could expand their hard-hitting exposes on the atrocities of the cultists and raiders outside our lands, even if the push-and-pull arguments between the Colonel and the Editor-in-Chief will become legendary."
  MCA_papers_please_tt:0 "\n\n§gThe Montana Patriot will keep you appraised of events in Montana. §RBut be careful, for a hostile newspaper is to be more feared than a thousand bayonets.§!§!"

  MCA_water_water:0 "Flood Irrigation"
  MCA_water_water_desc:0 "The first settlers of Montana relied on flood irrigation, but electric pump and mechanized sprinklers can work for certain farms. The machines that once strip mined Montana can now be used to help our farms grow all the crops we will ever need."

  MCA_marshalls:0 "The Marshals"
  MCA_marshalls_desc:0 "Led by Sheriff Heather, the Marshals serve as 'civilian auxiliaries' to MacArthur and enforce the Colonel's authority in Missoula and beyond. Increasing their ranks will bolster the United States Army's limited manpower out west."
  MCA_formosa_franks:0 "Formosa Frank's Firearms"
  MCA_formosa_franks_desc:0 "Some say Frank's family were held in Camp Little Guangdong when the bombs fell, but the way he tells it, they were loyal citizens. Whatever his family's backstory, he's long been the best weaponsmith in Missoula."
  MCA_electrify_lower_rattlesnake:0 "Light Up the Rattlesnakes"

  MCA_little_reno_desc:0 "The Salvatores came east from Reno with us after the fall of Navarro. Now one of them seeks to set up a charming little club to give people a taste of the flavours of the West."
  MCA_mac_machine_shop:0 "McSweeney's Machine Shop"
  MCA_mac_machine_shop_desc:0 "McSweeney's faux Scottish accent (derived from holotapes and prewar recordings) is annoying, but none can deny that he runs the best machine shop in Missoula. Or the only one, if we're being honest."
  MCA_guitar_factory:0 "The Guitar Factory"
  MCA_guitar_factory_desc:0 "Bozeman was home to a mighty guitar factory before the War, and craftsmen continue this tradition to this day. Although some of the songs are surprisingly... unorthodox, none can deny the sweet sounds they play."
  MCA_highway:0 "Refurbish the Highway"
  MCA_highway_desc:0 "Montana's great highways have fallen into disarray, but [MCA.GetLeader] will spare no expense to improve the lives of her citizens. That this will help the Army travel is, of course, a nice benefit."
  MCA_bozeman_energy:0 "Harness the Bozeman Hot Springs"

  MCA_defend_against_brotherhood_desc:0 "We stand now at the precipice. The Brotherhood of Steel, in their arrogance, seek to replace your safety and freedom under the Enclave with tyranny and oppression. Let them come! Wave upon traitorous wave will crash against MacArthur's walls! The Brotherhood of Steel will fail! God bless the Enclave! God bless America!"
  MCA_canada_spy:0 "Our Eyes in Canada"
  MCA_canada_spy_desc:0 "The Enclave, they say, is everywhere. And that includes up north, where Agent Sigma stands on guard against communists, monarchists, and whatever other garbage the Canadians are up to. Perhaps we could send him some resources"
  MCA_victory_brotherhood:0 "The Fate of Traitors"
  MCA_victory_brotherhood_desc:0 "The Brotherhood is descended from scum who abandoned our people in their hour of need. Fortunately, it is well established that 'Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death.'"
  MCA_brotherhood_atrocities:0 "Support the Brotherhood's Enemies"
  MCA_brotherhood_atrocities_desc:0 "People of Montana, we are all that stands between you and the destruction of our great state. Do you want mutants occupying your homes?

  MCA_greatfalls:0 "The Great Falls Restoration"
  MCA_greatfalls_desc:0 "Great Falls' position on the Missouri River provides ample hydroelectric power for use in a variety of industrial projects.

  MCA_concessions_to_first_families:0 "First Family Investment"
  MCA_concessions_to_first_families_desc:0 "Sadly, the Jackson's "Rebellion" destroyed much of Missoula's leadership, and left deep scars on the area. If we want to restore the town's prosperity, it might be best to encourage the First Families to help."
  MCA_power_plant:0 "Expand the Dam"
  MCA_power_plant_desc:0 "Say what you will about the Storm Mongers' levies, they did manage to restore the dam that once powered Great Falls. With our superior American engineering we can continue their work!"
  MCA_great_falls_university:0 "Great Falls University"
  MCA_great_falls_university_desc:0 "Although Montana's centres of higher learning did not survive the Great War, some old Manifest facilities could give us a chance to start something of value in Great Falls.

  MCA_machine_shops:0 "Refugee Machine Shops"
  MCA_machine_shops_desc:0 "Many of the captives taken by the Storm Mongers that weren't sacrificed were enslaved and forced to work in their machine shops, tending to their planes. Now that they're under our control, we can give them their old equipment to open workshops in Great Falls."
  MCA_tiki_bar:0 "Salvatore's Tiki Bar"
  MCA_tiki_bar_desc:0 "It seems Salvatore wants to open yet another bar, this one inspired by an old Pre-War Hawaiian establishment. Although a silly idea, he hopes to turn it into the anchor of a new market for the region. Who are we to stand in the way of progress?"
  MCA_markham_plan:0 "Markham's Plan"
  MCA_markham_plan_desc:0 "Markham hopes to use [653.GetName] to introduce some of Chicago's efficiency to the West. She's asked permission to run several workshops by algorithms and data, taking human bias out of the equation. Just like Chicago, in a way. \n\nWho can complain?"
  MCA_steeltown:0 "Steeltown!"
  MCA_steeltown_desc:0 "Under the Enclave's rule, Great Falls has turned from a savage raider stronghoold into a thriving hub of commerce. We're dubbing it Steeltown to relfect not just the mountains of scrap still being smelted down, but its purpose as a new trading hub and the industrial heart of §P[MCA.GetName]§!'s economy."
  MCA_horrigan_ii:0 "Our Colleague"
  MCA_horrigan_ii_desc:0 "Not all the research from the Rig was lost. The Secretary of the Interior sent a soldier modified based on the research used on Frank Horrigan. The end is near- For America's enemies!"

  MCA_loot_brotherhood_stockpiles_desc:0 "Although the Secretary of the Interior would prefer to gain all knowledge and information we have on the Brotherhood, we could make use of those resources here. Doing so, of course, will annoy the Secretary of the Interior, who is our superior officer."

But most of them don't know the tale of the men and women who kept the dream alive in the darkness that followed. The Richardsons served America after the Great War, preserving its dream and protecting its citizens, whether or not they knew it. An enclave of the best and the brightest, who would keep the torch of freedom lit until it could burn again. They were close too, you know. The last Richardson had a plan to save the Wasteland, a weapon that would kill the Super Mutants, feral ghouls, and dangerous mutants who held back recovery... until it all fell apart.\n\nNobody knows what happened to the Rig. A Brotherhood of Steel commando raid? Remnants of the Unity? Perhaps it was the Desert Rangers, cloaking their hatred of America in their sweet lies of liberty. Certainly the NCR had no problem pouring north with tribals, Brotherhood Paladins, and others in tow. The Enclave killed many, but we had to leave. With the chain of command in disarray, Colonel Ellen Santiago took charge for just a few hours, and started the flight east.\n\nLet us honor her, and how she worked to save America in the West."

Thundering gun battles echoed across the Great Plains as they carved through the Brotherhood's despotism to reach Chicago. But Santiago, and those who followed her after she relinquished her temporary command? In the name of fighting a 'rearguard action,' they ended their trek at MacArthur Air Force Base, knowing full well where they stood vigil was the frontier of the United States of America. With support from the Secretary of the Interior, they acted as the western flank of the Enclave. Gone was the President, Navarro, and the Oil Rig; in its place was a land lightly touched by radiation and home to happy, healthy children. A land where old soldiers never died- they just faded away.\n\nFor something odd happened in the region. To survive, MacArthur began to trade with the surrounding towns and ranches. As relationships followed trade, soldiers turned into ranchers, medics into doctors. When Missoula asked for help against Heaven's Gate in 2268, she was protecting her retired veterans as much as she was the people of the town."

But in every society some are more equal than others, and Missoula was no exception. The First Families, descended from the scavengers who returned after the War, controlled the best lands, the best forests, and the best mines. Colonel Santiago's detachment only increased the division, for who but the rich could afford the Army Corps of Engineers? Moreover, the increased security Santiago brought turned the region into a magnet for refugees fleeing Heaven's Gate and the Khans. The lucky ones found jobs in sweatshops or farms. The unlucky ones? Well, there was a winter every year. \n\nOne of Santiago's more considered decision was the use of auxiliaries, trained with local equipment. Some favoured drawing forces from the First Families, but others counseled that the refugees would be reliable to whoever offered a better life."

Robert Peele, one of the First Families, defended the officer at the trial. He instructed the jurors, selected from the people of Missoula, to look beyond the officer's origin, and look to what happened that night. Peele noted that the mob gathered in response to a purely private, commercial dispute- that it was an accepted right for a Montanan to hold a firearm, they were entitled to stand their ground under threat- and that, based on several eye witnesses, the mob advanced despite warnings. Therefore, the jury found Officer Hardgrave not guilty. \n\nAlthough he may have gone free, the Enclave's officers were still furious. If one officer could be charged, where would this end? But for Mr. Peele, the day would be long remembered as a cornerstone of Montana's salvation.

The Jacksons were expelled for challenging the Colonel's rule and pushing for the people of Missoula to have a say in how Montana was run! For their request, the Colonel destroyed their ranch, seized their assets, and drove them east. There on the plains the Jacksons' turned their business acumen and organizational skills to raiding because it was the only way to survive. Put another way, one of the greatest threats to Montana could be viewed as the Colonel's fault!\n\nNow the Montana Patriot has the story and is threatening to publish it.

But perhaps there is no escaping the past, for Team October tracked down Wind-That-Tangles as he was wanted for killing a dozen civilians and sacrificing them to the Storm Father.\n\nNow Martha Santiago must decide- will she spare the man who turned a dozen fathers into kites?

Production quotas and low salaries lead to tired, hungry workers. People who dreamed of a better life for their children die as they see their futures. Markham's plan for Steeltown is a trap, and at long last, the workers have risen up. To quote Salene Crow, leader of the strikers: "No more sixteen hour shifts, no more locking us in the factory so we can't see our family, and most importantly, Markham, no more you!

"You know you can't get drunk on that, right?"\n\n"Nothing real around here," he said. "But we all pretend anyway, don't we? Why not me too?" The old man paused, his eyes creasing. "So, is this a visit on behalf of the Colonel? Or just the local?" He took a step back, a smile on his face... and knocked over his Mr. Handy in the process. "Shit!" he shouted. "Damn thing will have to be repaired now."\n\nThe Corporal sat down, brushing away some crumbs from the table to do so as she waited for the old man to join her. "Some families asked me to check on their husbands and sons. You know, make sure they're okay, quash those Brotherhood rumors. I see you handled resource conscription, but the files don't say where, exactly, you and they went." Martha paused- the old man's hands were trembling. A reminder seemed to be in order as she hardened her face. "You owe me for Three Forks, Lionel."\n\n Lionel sighed. "I'm a washed-up old man, Corporal. What's in it for me to talk?""

The rendezvous for the riches of the North: the so-called free town on the River League, Saint Louis.\n\nThey flew over Wyoming, above the empty lands and stopped a ways east of Oahe Dam for rest and a short meal, having avoided the Plaguelands. Something about the paperwork and rumors were odd to Martha as she reviewed what she had over a Happy Pie- why did the Wastelanders need inoculations?\n\nStill, the information Team October found so far was innocuous. The rumours that conscripts were sacrificed to tribals, for instance, were false. And so it came to pass they flew towards Saint Louis, knowing full well they would have to stop well outside and covertly infiltrate the city (though at least one member was ready to hide a bomb in a Brotherhood vehicle).

The few she spoke to said they were fine and well fed, with the best medical care they'd ever seen. They lived in a barracks with heat and electricity, both hot and cold water running through clean plumbing. They'd be rich to have that back home!\n\nUnfortunately, this was not all of the missing folk. There'd been a few more, one worker mentioned. They'd been taken away for a cancer treatment to fix what RadAway couldn't cure. Was the Enclave not so thoughtful? They'd been taken to Saugutuck, up north, to recover.\n\nThe Corporal played with her Pip Boy later as she ate in one of the dive bars that accepted Ring Pulls instead of Dollars.

But Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori, eh?" \n\n"I'm dying and Chicago still looks down on me, babbling in a language as dead as China," the General thought aloud. "There's nothing to be done? We can design the Great Work, Horrigan, and goddamned Wanamingos, and you can't cure cancer?"\n\nThe good doctor looked at the results, making a note to add some tranquilizers to the General's coffee. The poor veteran worried too much, even now that her duty was done. "Perhaps if you were to resign, and go to Chicago? You've served with honors, is it not time to give it a rest?"
