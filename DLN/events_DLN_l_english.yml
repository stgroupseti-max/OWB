  nf_dln.1.d:0 "The Duchy of Langenburg came into being over one and a half centuries ago, when our ancestors pledged their loyalty to the newly proclaimed King of Winnipeg, Gunn I. With the Kingdom of Manitoba being proclaimed shortly thereafter, our lands prospered, the royal borders stretching all the way from the Shieldwall to old Codette. Sadly, all good things come to an end sooner or later. Unable to brunt the inevitable march of time, The Great Unifier eventually abdicated. The crown was passed onto the King's long-time friend, the Duke of Brandon, who over the course of his reign would succeed in unifying much of the South, today dubbed as "The Crownlands." Over the generations, the once esteemed line grew ever-more complacent and decadent, as did all those at the helm of the realm's duchies, plunging the Kingdom into chaos. All - except us. Our ancestors stood true to our values, toiling the fields day and night as the royal court drained the coffers in the name of lavish dances and neverending banquets.\n\nIn time, the cracks began to show. The first disaster came with the loss of the Kingdom's southernmost territories, held by the Duchy of Warwick, to a bloody revolt that would eventually lead to the formation of the Métis Congress. The second came shortly thereafter with the secession of Winnipeg and the neighbouring territories, which culminated in the devastating War of the Republican Coalition. The Electorals seized on this crisis, annexing large portions of the Duchy of Absalon while the bulk of the army was occupied down South. The remote Duchy of Angers was swiftly carved up by mercenaries and scoundrels, while the Duchy of Dawfin was forever crippled by a devastating surprise attack on its Royal Port during the tail-end of the conflict. One after another, they all fell - by the time the dust settled, only a remnant of their trades lived on through us."

  nf_dln.2.d:0 "In the early morning of the second day of the War of the Republican Coalition, the Métis leader Atoine Beausoleil marched onto the outskirts of the city of Yorkton, flanked by over 25,000 of the Congress's finest soldiers. On The Langenburgian side, unbeknownst to the enemy, stood Marshal Leif Yorkton. He was concealing an army less than half the size, one spawned by an uneasy alliance between the Duchy's military and exiles from Regina who had taken up residence in Fort Cap Hell. Assisting them was a coalition of the Kingdom's most elite Knights, hailing from the legendary Orders of The Archangel, Saint Peter, Saint George and Justus.\n\nThe battle begun with an artillery barrage targeting the city walls. To Atoine's surprise, fire was instantly returned from a nearby forest, obliterating his position. Despite the ensuing chaos among the Métis lines, Atoine was able to consolidate his ranks before the Langenburgian troops could descend on them, ordering a hasty retreat. The move would prove disastrous; seeing an opening, the marshal launched into a horseback charge alongside a squad of Knights. The subsequent pursuit would break the Métis lines for good, earning the Duchy an unlikely victory.\n\nThe marshal could not deem his victory absolute. Atoine had managed to scurry away, and Yorkton's daring charge had claimed the lives of some of his most elite Knights, including that of Torgir Weybrun, Grandmaster of the Order of the Archangel. Nevertheless, a crucial battle had been won on that day - one that would allow the marshal to march East and face the bulk of the Republican forces."

  nf_dln.3.d:0 "Leif Yorkton's father, Joran, was the first of his House to serve as the Duchy's marshal. He would leave this earth having established a reputation for fierce mental elasticity, thanks to a methodical and introspective approach to battlefield planning. His descendeants were determined to live up to that legacy.\n\nLeif sought to mitigate the drawbacks of hia father's approach, combining Joran's knack for extensive pre-planning with a more personal approach to combat that emphasised the marshal's role on the battlefield. Eleanor, Leif's daughter, instead saw untapped potential in her grandfather's baseline ideas. She argued the importance of even more long-term planning initiatives such as intensified special training and the teaching of military history.\n\nIn the end, one of these perspectives would come to influence the brass most."

  nf_dln.6.t:0 "He Came to Me on a Cold Night"
  nf_dln.6.d:0 "The Lord awoke in the dead of night, a royal courier donned in black awaiting him at the front door. Yorkton felt his heart sink as the man handed him a letter marked with the ducal insignia. No words needed to be exchanged. Both knew the messenger had arrived too early in the week to be delivering the State of the Duchy. \n\nThe man and the Lord left for the Capital that very same night. As he galloped, Yorkton's mind wandered. In his head, pictures of a great white shore were forming, an incadesceant ball of flames setting on the horizon. He was young. He was crying. The Duchess of Absalon did not want to play hide and seek with him. He had gone to hide away in the store room. But Sophie tracked him down. He knelt next to him, and embraced him, patting him over the head:"You know Leif, you can be the juiciest fruit in the orchid - but some people just don't like fruit. And that's ok! Life goes on. Have you asked the Duke of Dawfin if he'd like to play?" That was the first of many lessons. Then came the schooling. The fencing classes. The council shadowing. The hike trails, the - \n\nYorkton's thoughts were interrupted as a gust of cold wind washed over him. The rest of the ride was quiet. Neither him nor the courier wanted to dwell on the knowledge that she had taken her final breaths."
  nf_dln.6.a:0 "After that, the marshal came to appreciate the solitude of night."

  nf_dln.7.t:0 "The Duchess is dead..."
  nf_dln.7.d:0 "Bells were tolling across the city as they arrived, for the people had been informed of the tragedy that had just befallen the Duchy. The Lord dismounted as he approached the Capital's boulevard, before making his way to the ducal palace on foot. Sophie's loyal butler, Tobias, watched him emerge from the sea of mourners that had gathered at the foot of the gates. The Lord held his head high, though Tobias recognised it for the act that it clearly was - his eyes betrayed the knot that had formed in his throat. The crowd parted as he advanced, some offering words of condolence to him as he passed by. For some, little more than a formality - for most a cathartic act of grievance.\n\nTobias pulled open the palace gates, allowing Yorkton to squeeze through. They entered the immaculate halls and approached Sophie's resting place. The Lord's hand laid on the handle. Expecting his dismissal, the butler made to leave - instead, Yorkton asked him to stay. Without turning to face him, he muttered:“This is their fault, Tobias. It is because of them that she has left us. Left me...” Tobias remained silent, unsure of whom he spoke of. Yorkton's next words, however, revealed the subject of his venomous ire:“That rotted corpse of a King. The corrupt nobles. The traitorous bastards of Winnipeg. They weakened her, sapped her of all her strength and determination. On this, I swear - they all shall pay.”\n\nTobias held his tongue, for Lord spoke of treason against the crown itself. It was then that he entered her room, and paid his final, heartfelt respects to the woman that had raised him as her own. There, he remained to grieve, until the sun's glow began to wane, and the shadows cast long. Finally, as the Lord said his final goodbye, Tobias presented him with the Duchess's will. The butler watched him as he read it, the marshal's eyes widening and narrowing as they darted back and forth across the document. He turned to look at Tobias, and spoke in a tone as cold as the frigid lakes:“Gather the Ducal Cabinet. There is much work to be done.”"

  nf_dln.8.t:0 "History Awaits"
  nf_dln.8.d:0 "“My Lord, the time has come,” exclaimed Tobias: "we will have to make our move soon. There is no time to dwell until we see the conflict through. Say the word and I will have our riders sent out to rally our loyalists to your banner." Yorkton kept gazing out the palace window, the heavy rain clattering against the thin layer of glass: “How many will answer the call?”\n\nTobias replied: “Individually, My Lord? Few. But with enough work, a worthy coalition can be mustered.” The butler pulled out a notepad, before adjusting his spectacles: “As you will recall, most veteran Knights were posted across the Duchy followng the disbandment of the Orders. The memory of your deeds lives on in their hearts - I doubt many will hesitate to rally at your side. The same is true for our regulars.” Tobias glanced over to the marshal: “Alone, they will hardly do. The Fort Cap Hell enforcers, the exiles, the remnants of House Dawfin in the North... I am afraid some level of compromise is called for.”\n\nYorkton remained quiet for a time, taking in the man's words: “Do you think we stand a chance Tobias?” The royal butler immediately caught onto the slight quiver in the marshal's voice: “Are you afraid of failing Sophie, My Lord?” The marshal finally turned, a newfound look of steeled determination washing across his face: “Get my coat, we are moving out.”"

  nf_dln.9.t:0 "The Archangel Returns"
  nf_dln.9.d:0 "Leading the search for the Knights in exile was Alecander Weyburn, son of the fallen Grandmaster of the Order of the Archangel. The young man's presence was instrumental in convincing some the more despondent veterans out in the far-flung reaches of the North to make their return. Many agreed on one condition - that Alecander take up his father's mantle and officially restore the Order following its dismemberment at the hands of the cowardly Manitoban nobles.\n\nAnd so, in a day filled with pomp and ceremony, Alecander raised the sacred Standard last seen trampled at the Battle of Yorkton. There, in the ducal chapel, he gave the Pledge of the Archangel before the Order's remnants, solemly offering his heart for the people of Manitoba. He would protect the rightful King until the day God took him from this earth, be it from enemies without... or within."

  nf_dln.10.t:0 "Last Will and Testament"
  nf_dln.10.d:0 "Lord Yorkton emerged onto the balcony of the ducal palace overlooking the solemn cobblestone front yard and the curious masses of the capital. City officials had summoned them to the palace gates for reasons undisclosed.  He leaned into the microphone placed on the podium before him: “Loyal subjects of the Royal Duchy - I thank you all for coming. As you may be aware, I have been presiding over the lands of Langenburg as Regent since the passing of Her Grace...” He paused for a moment, letting the fond memories of the Duchess's reign wash over the masses: “During this time, I have seen it to carrying out the measures listed in her will. You may have seen an influx of land surveyors throughout your neighbourhoods, as well as more frequent armed patrols roaming the capital.”\n\n“But the reason I have brought you here today, is to announce her final request.” He paused again. This was it: “Her Grace has entrusted me, Leif Yorkton, with the rule of the Realm”. Murmurs and chatter filled the yard: “As most of you will be aware, the Duchess had no direct descendants. It would have been easy for her to allow the realm to fall into the hands of the King, as custom would dictate in these circumstances.” He raised his finger in the air: “But Her Grace recognised the danger facing the Duchy. She recognised the decadence, the contempt, and the infighting, that have brought ruin to the Kingdom. She knew that the realm could not prosper under a hollow King.” He paused, letting his vitriol settle into the crowd: “Even in death, she seeks to protect you - and has entrusted me to carry out that most noble of goals. And as I have done once several moons ago, I will strive to succeed in that endeavour once more”.\n\nHe stopped. Seconds went by, interminably. Eventually, from the back of the crowds, a faint chant reached him: “..ton”. Then louder: “Lord Yorkton”. Then louder still: “LORD-YORK-TON”, until the yard erupted into one unified cry “LORD-YORK-TON, LORD-YORK-TON, LORD-YORK-TON”. He raised his arms for the crowd: whether it was the Duchess's legacy, or his own record on the battlefield, he had done it. The dice was cast. Within days, word would reach Brandon. Within days, the powers that be would muster the forces to crush this new threat to their bloodline - and within days, he would cross the Assiniboine to put a stop to them."
  nf_dln.10.a:0 "“Print out the will and spread it to the neighbouring settlements.”"

  nf_dln.11.t:0 "The Duchess Deal"
  nf_dln.11.d:0 "Over the course of several weeks, Yorkton travelled from settlement to settlement across the land in the hopes of mustering support from some of the minor counts and title holders within the Duchy of Langenburg. He had saved the most troublesome for last: Duchess Bellores, of the fallen House of Dawfin.\n\nThe titular settlement was once the source Manitoba's naval prowess, boasting a large Old World port connected to the greater Lake Winnipegosis through a narrow river strait.  During the course of the War of the Republican Coalition, hubris got the best of Bellores's father, who failed to recognise the trap he was being lured into by the insurgents. In one fell swoop, the Kingdom lost the vast majority of its navy, leaving the Royal Port of Dawfin vulnerable to a devastating attack which crippled Manitoba's hold over the waters and cost the duke his life.\n\nThe chaotic struggle for inheritance that followed left Duchess Bellores landless, forcing her and a small cabal of loyalists into exile within the lands of Langenburg. As a token of gratitude for Sophie's magnanimity, the fallen noble has spent every moon since fighting back against the monstrous horrors spilling across the Duchy's Northern frontiers from the neighbouring Blighted Woods.\n\nThe good Duchess came with a lot of baggage, Yorkton thought to himself as he considered requesting her support ahead of what was to come. Her men had been through hell and back, no doubt - they would prove a formidable asset. The prospect of restoring ownership of House Dawfin to the rightful heir should be enough motivation for the Duchess to offer her heart for the time being - But once the dust had settled, what else could such a powerful ally hold over his head?\n\nYorkton continued to ponder this dilemma as he sent for Alecander, who marched through his chamber minutes later: “You called My Lord?”. The marshal turned to his right-hand man:"

  nf_dln.12.d:0 "He was informed they would be awaiting in the courtyard. Yorkton expected a dozen. Couple dozen perhaps, if he was lucky. But when he emerged out of the ducal palace, Langenburg’s proud coat of arms could be seen stretching on beyond the gates.\n\nThey all heeded his call. Remnants of the disbanded Knights’ Order. Up-and-comers cast out by jealous and insecure brass. The unsavoury types who were not afraid to bend the rules to get results.\n\nThe eldest of the group stepped forth: “Not one man recoiled when the herald came to us. We are yours to command.” Yorkton placed his hand on his shoulder: “In standing with me today, you have just secured a better tomorrow. Let us fight to our last breath to ensure it is not squandered.”"
  nf_dln.12.a:0 "“Yes, My Lord!”"

  nf_dln.13.t:0 "Fort Cap Hell"
  nf_dln.13.d:0 "Within the Duchy of Langenburg, there remained one more major faction with the power to stack the odds in the marshal's favour: The exiles of Fort Cap Hell. Originally acting as enforcers for the House of Warwick in the city of Regina, they were displaced following the Métis uprising that brought an end to the family's rule over the Southern duchy.\n\nIn the decades that followed, they kept a largely low profile, living out quiet lives in the Western outskirts of the Duchy of Langenburg, keeping watch over everyday low-lives and renegades. That was until the War of the Republican Coalition. Once the Métis armies were driven back, Yorkton had to practically negotiate with the exiles’ leaders to dissuade them from undertaking a revenge tour throughoout Regina. On that day, their lingering hatred for the insurgents was made plain for all to see. And so too did the extensive stockpile of weapons they had retained since their initial escape. Interestingly, neither Sophie nor Gunn II ever moved to requisition the weaponry. Perhaps they thought the exiles' zealousness could eventually be put to good use - and it would appear that that day had come at last.\n\nThey say it is best to let sleeping dogs lie – but this one had fangs unlike any Yorkton had seen before. Promising an eventual march into Regina should be an alluring enough proposition to secure the exiles' support. But what then? Once let loose, Yorkton would struggle to prevent them from unleashing vengence on every man or woman with ties or loyalties to the Métis Congress. That would send a clear message no doubt... but is this the kind of bloody precedent the marshal wanted to set for his new realm?"

  nf_dln.14.d:0 "Yorkton swung open the doors of the ducal armory, the smell of gunpowder and cold steel immediately assaulting his senses. On site were a handful of guards, dragging in the last of the crates from outside. One of them sprinted over to the marshal: “Please my Lord, we have not had the opportunity to fully inspect the shipment yet and...” Yorkton dismissed him, approaching the dozen or so containers that had been dragged to the back the room.\n\nHe grabbed a nearby crowbar and cranked open one of the sealed crates - rifles and ammunition boxes. Just like all rest. Nothing exactly flashy or state-of-the-art. But sturdy, efficient and most importantly – easy for anyone to wield.\n\nOne of the patrols had found the crates scattered in front of the palace gates in the dead of night, the marshal's mysterious benefactor using the cover of the blizzard to go by undetected. Whoever they may be, they must sit within the marshal's inner circle. Someone aware of Yorkton's plans for the Duchy. Whatever the case, the Sword of the North was not about to let this investment go to waste."

  nf_dln.15.t:0 "The Day Long Awaited"
  nf_dln.15.d:0 "Lord Yorkton swung open the immaculate wooden doors of the Kingdom's throne room, slowly taking in the sights of the decadent royal hall as memories of his youth came flooding in. It was here where the rightful King had first issued him with the monumental task of defending the land from the insurrectionists gnawing at the realm from all directions. And it was here where a cabal of cowardly aristocrats plotted to take what he had rightfully earned on the field of battle from under him. Ever since the takeover of the rancid Gunn II, the Kingdom had faced steady decline - but it seemed as though the rot had done nothing to sully the splendour of these halls.\n\nHis reminiscing was interrupted by an unexpected sight - the crown of the Kingdom, as enchanting as the walls that contained it, discarded on the cold floors. The timing could not have worked out better - As the elite detachment of Knights accompanying the marshal entered the hall following their external sweep, the first thing they laid eyes on, was a man raising the most important jewel of the land over his head. The soldiers dropped to one knee in reverence - but before their Captain could utter a word, Lord Yorkton was quick to set his priorities straight: “Launch a search of the palace and its surroundings for Gunn and his ilk. I want him before me over the coming days.” He then turned to the Knights' second-in-command; “you, issue a message to platoon leaders stationed across the major settlements. Tell them to inform the local Counts that I shall be in touch soon to discuss...” He paused for a moment: “... upcoming administrative adjustments.”\n\nWith that, the Knights quickly got back on their feet, and scrambled out the hall. Lord Yorkton began pacing around the room - he had just bought himself some time. There was only one matter left to resolve before he could consolidate his rule: cutting off the head of the snake."

  nf_dln.16.t:0 "Their Day Has Come"
  nf_dln.16.d:0 "Yorkton quickly straightened back into his throne as a procession of Knights and palace guards marched into the halls of the tribunal. Both Judge and Jury, sitting to his left and across the hall from him respectively, turned to watch as the armed men shoved King Gunn II and Queen Katherine into the centre of the room, a bright spotlight casting down from above their heads. The Knights had found them huddled in a corner of a hidden set of chambers, the man's visage buried deep in the weeping Queen's arms. It had been days, yet Lord Yorkton could still spot the trails of expensive eyeliner encrusted onto the woman's cheeks. His eyes darted over to the fallen King, his visage hollow and unmoving. Was this all he had pictured himself triumphing over for years? A husk of a man on the verge of clinical insanity and his profligate spouse?\n\nThe trial carried on for hours, the Judge painstakingly listing out each and every one of the administrative failures, abuses of power and reckless warmongering that had taken place under Gunn's stewardship. As the day carried on, Yorkton's daughter Eleanor, who was stood at his side alongside the King's personal guard regiment, appeared increasingly restless. As the trial began drawing to a close, she inched closer, softly tugging at his sleeve: “Father, a word?”. Yorkton glanced over to the Judge, lightly raising his hand, who in turn bellowed out: “The Jury will withdraw to deliberate.”\n\nEleanor led Yorkton to a side room, closing the door behind them: “Father, I understand why you may feel that letting the King live is a risk too great but...” she looked down at the floor: “Please, spare Queen Katherine. Even as Consort, she has always done well by the people, I have witnessed it! She does not deserve what is coming to Gunn.” Yorkton corked an eyebrow: “Oh? A few months in his court and you already start making friends? And besides, it is for the Jury to decide...” Eleanor snapped back: “The Jury YOU picked out? I recall playing Knights with half the people in that tribune when I was a child.” Yorkton opened his mouth in protest but was cut off: “Please, just... lock her away if you have to. This bloodshed, it's... it's unnecessary.” She moved closer to him: “Father - what kind of leader do you dream of becoming?” She looked away, dejectedly: “The Sword of the North I grew up hearing stories of would know.”"

Ever since the initial calls for entry weeks prior, hordes of engineers, scientists, and - let's be honest - garden-variety inventors from across the realm had made the pilgrimage to the royal palace, in the hopes of earning their spot in the showcase. This was on top of the already numerous official submissions made by the King's team of scientific advisors. What started out as a novel idea to bolster the Kingdom's technological reputation across the North had quickly spiralled out into an administrative nightmare that was distracting Yorkton from more urgent state affairs.\n\nBefore the Chief Royal Scientific Advisor could make his way out of the throne room to bring in yet more submissions, the King grabbed him by the collar and yanked him to a corner of the hall: “I am beginning to suspect that a more clinical approach may be in order here.” The bureucrat let out a nervous smile: “What did you have in mind, My Lord?” Yorkton scratched his chin, pensively: “Let us begin by setting a clear theme for this year's showcase. It may help us carve out a niche for ourselves...” And probably save us the paperwork, the King thought to himself. The Crown Servant responded, enthusiastically: “That is a brilliant idea, My Liege. No doubt it would catch the eye of specialists from across the region.”\n\nThe King nodded: “Very well then...”"

  nf_dln.18.d:0 "As Yorkton passed from village to village across Langenburg, all he was met with was the smiles of his subjects, and the prosperity of his settlements. He had asked Alecander to join the Knight's latest patrol of the Duchy, a special, bi-annual ceremony designed to both survey the region and showcase the army's upkeep to the people. By now a routine event to the residents of Langenburg, the King's presence on this occasion appeared to have drawn just about every sightseer out into the freezing cold of Manitoba.\n\nA thought struck Yorkton as he took in the view: of all the work that he had done since his takeover, of all the sweat he had poured into holding the Kingdom together - he had barely had to give the Duchy a thought. And why should he have? The foundations had already been laid decades prior, Sophie's long reign having brought on countless public works, technological revolutions, and new economic opportunities. All he had done, really, was simply ensuring that these systems continued to run as intended - and where possible export them to the wider Kingdom.\n\n“This was your will all along, was it not, Sophie? This is why you have chosen me.” He thought to himself. Even in her last moments, she knew that Yorkton's limitless ambition would be the best vessel for her vision. And at least for now, history had proven her right. Her legacy was safe - but it would not be truly secure until the lights and hopes of Langenburg shined across the North and into the starry night sky above.\n\nAnd for that... more work would need to be done. All Yorkton could hope for, was that she would continue to watch over him for what was to come."

In his younger years, he would travel there with Father and Sophie during the frequent high-society parties masquerading as state dinners. The Court itself was gone - and yet the dinner chairs stuck out of the rubble, defiant.\n\nThe seat of the Anger family, the wealthiest of them all, and by their side that of the Duke of Dawfin, a House renowned for its lake-faring prowess. Just opposite was the seat reserved for the Warwick line, masters of the machine... theirs had remained vacant the longest. Next to it, the chair honouring the storied Duchy of Absalon, and in the middle the most lavish of them all, the King's throne.\n\nThe silence was deafening. Halls once bursting at the seams with cheer and joy now merely giving way to the creaking of rotting wood planks and the squeaking of rats. Yorkton's resolve felt tested, his frustration with the Monarchy's decadence and excesses struggling against memories of the old Duke of Dawfin smuggling him candy - or the young Duchess of Angers taking him boating - or Lord Absalon showing off his toys.\n\nThe warm memories were washed away by the monochrome ruins once more as a soldier bellowed out:"My Lord, please come out of there it's about to give!"

Yorkton glanced over his shoulder and let out a smile as he watched his spouse waving to the countrymen she had once feared being denied for the rest of her life: “Taking in the sights?” He asked jokingly. She leaned over, giving him a light peck on the cheek: “Quite”.\n\nThe convoy soon reached the Royal Port. It was a sight to behold. In just a few months, the royal couple had turned the wharf from little more than a decaying landing bay into a bustling shipyard, a true jewel of the Kingdom.\n\nDocked next to the beautiful cobblestone streets was a seemingly endless row of everything from mighty galleys to modern, state-of-the-art speedboats. And even in the dead of night, workers could be spotted dashing to and from the nearby warehouses, their bosses perhaps hoping to get ahead of their competitors on monthly quotas.\n\nThe King glanced back over to Belloress, the glint in her eye betraying her stoic demeanour: “Are you sure you are well?” He inquired. She responded, the lump in her throat clearly audible: “It's just... I wasn’t expecting that we would be able to turn things around so soon.” In that moment, Yorkton swelled with pride. This was it, all that he had fought for, all that he had suffered for over the past years: to restore the glory of this once great Kingdom and the smile of those within. He responded: “Then you better set your expectations higher my lady”.\n\nContent in what he had witnessed that night, he ordered for his regiment to start making its way back, firmly clasping Bellores's hand as he galloped into the night."

He ordered his second-in-command to follow the lead while he took care of... personal business.\n\nAs he galloped to his destination, memories of King Yortkon's last words to him came flooding back: “Alecander my boy, the opportunity is finally at hand; for you finally reclaim what your bloodline is owed.” That was all the young warrior needed to hear.\n\nAfter a few minutes, he had finally arrived: under the pouring rain, there stood the remains of the ancient Weyburn hamlet, passed down from generation to generation; until travesty hit. He had heard stories of that day; of the mobs at thegate; of their defiance; and of the charcoal and ruins they were rewarded with.\n\nAlecander weighed through the rubble, making his way through the rotten archway before eventually stumbling onto the remains of the grand fireplace situated in the atrium. It still laid atop the mantlepiece - the family coat of arms, encased in a layer of thick, protective glass. He smashed open the casing, before slowly lifting out the cloth, clasping it against his chest.\n\nHe looked around; he had a lot of work ahead of him. But on that day, the fragmented pieces of House Weyburn would finally begin to come together again. And with them, the legacy that had once brought peace and prosperity to those lands."

As the city's pacification efforts dragged out into a prolonged, bloody guerrilla war, he figured the men could do with a morale boost in the form of a battlefield visit from the Sword of the North.\n\nYorkton was greeted by the leader of the battalion, a stocky, bearded man boasting an eyepatch and a weary look: “Welcome My Lord. Please, let me show you around...” As the King marched through the camp, men would come out from their tents, dropping to one knee in reverence. Yorkton saluted as many as he could, his heart growing heavier with every butchered limb and grievous injury he rested his gaze on.\n\nHe was eventually led to the centre of the camp, where gallows had been erected. Hanging from them were men and women in civilian clothing, wooden signs draped around their necks reading: “TRAITORS”. Yorkton took the soldier to one side: “What are you running here? A military camp or a butcher shop?”. The man was taken aback: “My Lord... we are setting an example here.”\n\nYorkton glanced back over to the gallows... no. Not like this: “Tone it down. Limit executions to only the staunchest loyalists. We are bringing back the old ways, not ushering in bloody new ones.” The commander, looking somewhat dismayed, responded: “Yes, My Lord”.\n\nYorkton spent the next few hours speaking with injured soldiers and getting to know some of the new recruits. In the back of his mind was one prevailing thought - everything would be alright. Soon. They just needed to hang on for a little bit longer. Just a little bit longer..."

He only had to say the word and the men would “suggest” to those inside that Queen Katherine could not be held accountable for the sins of her husband. Regardless, he could not imagine a future where letting a member of the recently deposed monarchy breathe would not come back to haunt him...\n\n“...My Lord?” Yorkton snapped out of his thoughts:"

The man pushed his reading glasses back as he skimmed through the document: “... Very well”. He glanced over to the Jury, nodding.\n\nA man in the tribunes stood up reading out from a booklet: “After careful consideration of the evidence presented the Jury finds Gunn II guilty on all counts”. Without hesitation, the Judge turned to the accused: “For your crimes against the realm, I sentence you to death by hanging. The execution will be carried out at dawn.” He nodded to the Knights stood on guard: “Take him away”.\n\nThe Knights dragged Gunn out the hall, the man's hollow visage remaining motionless throughout the entire ordeal. Katherine dropped to her knees, quietly sobbing to herself.\n\nAfter a brief moment, the Jury representative resumed his statement: “As for the former Consort... Whilst the Jury acknowledges her complicity in the crimes of her husband, it also recognises her efforts in stemming the worst excesses of the previous administration. Thus, we move for a lighter sentence.” The Judge nodded: “For you crimes against the realm, I sentence you to fifteen years in gaol.” Katherine looked over to the man, teary eyed, before collapsing to the ground once more.\n\nYorkton glanced over to Eleanor, gratitude washing over her warm, hazelnut eyes. The two exchanged a weak smile. The new King would ensure that Katherine's prison quarters be as hospitable as possible. Beyond that... all he could hope for was for this clemency to not come back to haunt him."

  nf_dln.25.d:0 "The Judge grunted, as he shuffled through a stack of papers scattered across his desk: “We move on to the final agenda item for the day... the privatisation of the Hudson's Bay Company.”\n\nOh, right - the Hudson's Bay. An interesting case, that one. According to the ancient texts, it existed as a fur-trading enterprise centuries before the bombs even dropped. Before the Great War, it had evolved into a proper commercial empire whose influence spread from coast to coast. No surprise it retained enough influence to continue operating as a de-facto governing authority in the decades leading up to the formation of the Kingdom. And even then, the old regime was too cowardly to put it in its place, allowing it to effectively carve out a Duchy of its own in the North - until today anyway.\n\nYorkton had no love for faceless rulers. In the chaotic aftermath of his immediate takeover, he instructed a small squad of Knights to discreetly apprehend the Company's board and seize its assets. All they had left to their name was a small, bespectacled man representing them in court. But the Company's fate had already been decided. All he could do, was report to his superiors that..."

If we were to meet them halfway, make them subjects of the crown in all effects - that could be corrected. And besides, an experienced hand steering the lands of the Kingdom's wild frontier would not be unwelcome.\n\nBut could the King put faith in a cabal of men who had turned their backs on him in the moment of need? Nothing prevented them from doing so once more. Not to mention he would effectively be endorsing borderline vigilantism to keep the peace - would not exactly go down well back in the capital."

As he lifted his hood over his head and started making his way to the high street, he heard Tobias call out to him: “Please sire do make sure to return within an hour or so. And holler if you run into any trouble!”. Yorkton waved him off. It had been hard enough to convince Alecander to let him to take a stroll in public unsupervised - and even then, he had to agree to go incognito. He wasn't about to validate those concerns.\n\nAfter moseying through Dawfin's busy marketplace for a few minutes, Yorkton finally reached the Royal Port. It was a sight to behold. In just a few months, the King had turned the wharf from little more than a decaying landing bay into a bustling shipyard, a true jewel of the Kingdom. Docked next to the beautiful cobblestone streets was a seemingly endless row of everything from mighty galleys to modern, state-of-the-art speedboats. And even in the dead of night, he could spot workers dashing to and from the nearby warehouses, their bosses perhaps hoping to get ahead of their competitors on monthly quotas.\n\n“Hey - outta the way ol' man.” a scruffy-looking worker blurted out as he brushed past Yorkton. Good, the King thought to himself - that was the kind of spunk needed to restore the might of the realm. Content in what he had witnessed that night, he began making his way back to the carriage, lightly whistling to himself."

At the opposite end of the town square stood the gallows, in all their Old World glory. In times of peace, they had been used to make an example of the settlement's most heinous criminals - but those days were long behind the Kingdom.\n\nInstead, on that early morning, Winnipeg's cold breeze greeted those that had dared turned their backs on their countrymen so long ago - the Republican, the Oligarch, the Man of God. All three stood on stage, surrounded by the city's most loyal soldiers, ready and eager to deliver the justice the traitors had long eluded.\n\nIn the crowds stood all sorts of subjects, from the young hungering for a show to the old taking in the cathartic display they had long dreamed of. And yet across the generations, the seething disdain and contempt was palpable, rotten fruit and excrements flinging out from across the front rows. Yorkton wished he could join them, wished he could personally wrap his fingers around the necks of those who had robbed him of his future.\n\nAnd yet, he served a grander purpose. His cheek sinking into his fist, he waited patiently for the executioner to finish listing out the innumerable crimes committed over the course of decades. The hooded man eventually glanced over to the King. Yorkton flicked his wrist - as did the executioner.\n\nThe floor dropped from underneath the traitors, their bodies wriggling and contorting for a few seconds as the nooses tightened around their wind-pipes, the deafening cheers of the crowds filling the town square. Seconds. All it took was a few seconds for the stain on Manitoba's legacy to be washed away forever. They could look to the future once more."

Among the cabal found within - they were the lucky ones.\n\n The men pushed further into the facility, the waves of abominations thinning as the air grew lighter. Eventually, the Knights turned a corner, only to be greeted by an unusually pristine corridor. At the end of it, a large hall adorned with giant monitors, each displaying the figure of a young lass draped in unusual garments.\n\n"Howdy Folks! Destiny's the name." a digitised, distored noise filled the room:"Come to say hi to your pals?" The cruel AI taunted the Knights for minutes on end, vaguely threatening that they would be join the ranks of their comrades before long. But derision soon turned to anger. And anger, to pleading. It became evident that the machine had no tricks left up its sleeves. The Knights, on the other hand, were keen to let loose, smashing up the servers and displays one-by-one, until the woman had been relegated to a sole, flickering screen:"Wait - err... you might wanna keep my memory card on hand. Plenty o' useful research on file. Your boss is gonna wanna see 'em, trust me on this!" The squad leader walked up to the AI. Not exactly a computer whiz, but a stupid man he was not.

Yorkton was sitting at the end of a long and immaculate pre-war conference table, his most capable Knights thoroughly scanning the men of the Confederacy from head to toe: “Ah your majesty; sit, please, we have much to discuss.” Howling Wolf glared at Yorkton, his icy cold stare betraying a glint of fear and uneasiness. Yorkton waited for a few seconds before continuing: “... Or stand, as you wish - I shall make things quick regardless.”\n\nYorkton held all the cards - both him and Howling Wolf knew that. Whatever was to leave his lips in that moment, so it would come to pass. The King had long contemplated the outcome of this meeting. Coming to an agreement with the tribals in exchange for a small land concession would save his men a potentially torturous - and certainly expensive - campaign in the frigid Northern reaches of the region. And yet, what was the value of the word from a sufficiently desperate people?\n\nYorkton sat up from his chair:"

He rolled it open, revealing a map of the Kingdom split into its various administrative regions, each bearing red circles of varying sizes. The former Duchy of Absalon’s featured the largest: “As you can see here, over the past year or so, the lands in and around Hudson Bay city have seen the largest net influx of migrants. Some of these fine folks have made for the frontier, settled down, blah blah... but the highest share work for... you guessed it – us!” The man’s grin widened.\n\nSlightly irked by the representative's showmanship, Yorkton inquired: “What is your point?” The man recollected himself: “My point is, business is booming! We have never had this much work on our hands, and yet we simply lack the facilities and staff capacity to make the most of it. With a small loan from the royal coffers, we should be able to expand some of our existing departments.” He, paused, raising his finger: “However - throw a little more our way, and you'll start seeing sister locations cropping up all over the North like fungus.” The man hesitated, perhaps realising the unpleasantness of his metaphor: “ 'Course, we'd need a slight... adjustment period, but after that –“ His eyes widened as a he blew out some air: “Just think of the opportunity my liege.”\n\nYorkton scratched his chin. It was true that the Hudson Bay Company had proven itself the most reliable business - and employer - in the North. But if there is one thing the people fear more than monstrous abominations, it's economic monopolies. Turning the request down would probably go down well with small business owners in the region...\n\nThe King rose to his feet:"

I would like to present our findings if you please.” Yorkton motioned him to proceed.\n\nThe royal advisor then flung himself into an-hour long presentation primarily consisting of dry accounting and statistical analysis. Just as the King’s focus was beginning to slip however, a passing mention caught his ear: “Come again,” he interrupted. The royal advisor shuffled through his papers and readjusted his spectacles: “Over the past year or so, the lands in and around Hudson Bay city have seen the largest net influx of migrants among our urban settlements – most are employed by the Company.”\n\nYorkton inquired further: “What of our staffing?” The royal advisor flipped through the pages of the report: “Wel, err, truth to be told sire, we are at capacity, even among contractors.” He glanced over to the King: “I was just about to get to this actually. Profits have been steady, but at the current level of public spending, they will likely plateau.”\n\n“What do you propose?” Inquired Yorkton. The man continued: “A large one-off investment could help us expand operations. Think new offices – not just in the city, itself, but the surrounding towns too. Profits would slump for a while to accommodate relocation, but we are confident it could pay off long-term.”\n\nYorkton scratched his chin pensively."

Yorkton let out a deep sigh, summoning every ounce of patience left in him. As he turned, he was met with the pearly-white smile and fiery locks of his cousin: “Hello Eric. It has been some time.” Eric sat in front of the marshal's desk, kicking his heels over the surface: “Tell me about it”.\n\nLeif sighed: “Done bleeding the Yanks dry already?” Eric placed his hands over his chest, playfully frowning: “Hey, all I have to offer are my services. If the customer decides they aren't the right fit, that's on them.” Leif sat back at his desk massaging his temple: “What do you want Eric? Also could you please put your feet down, I just had this brought in”. The cousin complied, leaning closer to the marshal: “Look, long story short, I need a new gig. They uh... I'm not exactly welcome back East no more. And I hear you're making some big moves”. Eric winked. Leif leaned back in his seat: “Right...”\n\nAs the marshal began compiling a list of excuses to send his troublesome cousin on his way, he stopped to reflect. At the height of its power, the Kingdom of Manitoba kissed the banks of just about every major river in the region. Trade was, as a result, one of its largest assets. Those days had come and gone but maybe... just maybe... he could be the man to recapture this lost legacy down the line. And once that was accomplished, he would need people who could manage the buying and selling of goods up and down those treacherous waters. Eric might have been a swindler on the side, but his experience in that field was undeniable.\n\nThe marshal groaned: “I might have something for you in the future, but you are going to have to be patient for the time being.” Eric bolted up: “YES, never doubted that I could count on you cousin, I knew those town guys down at the pub were full of it.” With that, he turned around and made his way out of the marshal's office, lightly whistling to himself."

To that end, I will introduce an elected chamber to host representatives from throughout Manitoba’s regions.”\n\nThe brows of the men at the table furrowed; just how far would she push it?

Arms and coffers, you have it.” He walked up to the Viscount: “I trust you can keep a record of your expenses, yes?

I would like to begin this morning’s gathering by posing a question.” She leaned forward: “Most everyone of the attendees was in service during the outbreak of the War of the Republican Coalition – tell me: what stoked the fires of that conflict?” Murmur and chatter filled the room, the unprecedented hint of royal introspection leaving the advisors at a loss.\n\nEleanor quickly caught onto the threads of the lively discussion taking place within the room: “No one answer will suffice. What we fell victim to are the countless manifestations of institutional malaise. Greed, corruption, complacency; the creeping poison of all peacetime regimes.”\n\nShe paused for a moment, letting her cryptic vitriol sit with her audience for a moment; for her, this had been a long time coming: “The Republicans yearned for political representation, the Old Believers for a piety that was not forthcoming, the Métis usurpers an escape from what was, in their minds, rule with an iron fist.” The cabinet was stunned – In another time, Eleanor’s words would have bordered on conspiracy against the crown “The lands they once occupied – and beyond - are back in our possession. How many generations removed from the next charismatic revolutionary are we exactly?”\n\nShe stood from her seat: “What I said during my coronation were not empty promises, as I am confident so many of you assumed. The second you leave this room, every single one of you will be put to work on the Manitoban Project. Power decentralisation, regional representation, state accountability – these are the only measures available to us to guarantee the Kingdom’s future for the centuries to come.” Her eyes darted from side to side, as a heavy silence fell onto the room."

He staggered over to the windowpane overlooking the palace courtyard, gazing into the dark waters of the lake on the horizon as he recovered his breath. It was that dream again. Of the Imperial Palace crumbling; of the Kingdom’s cities set ablaze in scorching hellfire; of Eleanor – He shook his head violently, perishing the thought.\n\nThe Sword of the North had lifted the heavens in the pursuit of his ambitions. He had proven the naysayers wrong, all of them – and yet for every day that passed, for every day he was not giving his all in leading the realm, he was inching his subjects closer to ruin.  How could he not when the North continued to be home to scoundrels and opportunists looking to pick at Manitoba’s carcass?\n\nHe glanced over to his trembling hand, clasping the windowsill. His time was running out. He could feel it. If he was to secure his children’s future, he would need to act now. Reinstating mass-conscription, mustering arms, marching on their lands, and salting the earth until -\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted as the doors of his chambers swung open. Eleanor called out to him: “Father!” He must have made more of a ruckus than he thought. She dashed over to him, walking him back to bed: “I sincerely hope you haven’t been skipping your dosages again.” Yorkton did not answer, instead looking up to his daughter as she lowered him down, running his hand down her cheek.\n\nEleanor – his pride, his starlight, the hopes of the Kingdom made flesh. A person who, for all her brilliance, the ailing King did not yet deem ready for matters of statecraft, the naïveté and trusting nature of youth clouding the sort of ironclad political judgement the harshness of the North called for. And yet, someone who would one day inevitably inherit all that he had built. Was the Kingdom truly equipped to embrace a ruler with such unshakeable vision?\n\nAs Eleanor started making her way out of the royal chamber, Yorkton hollered: “Eleanor -” She turned."

For everyone else, a royal call for gathering within the various town bars would have to suffice.\n\nScreens across the Kingdom flickered for a moment before casting the figure of Leif Yorkton sat upon the royal throne, the slight tilt of the camera emphasising the man’s imposing stature: “Subjects of the crown – I thank you for offering the next few minutes of your time for the sake of the realm. I want to take a moment to invite those of you, for whom memory allows, to close your eyes and cast your minds back to merely one decade ago. What do you picture?”\n\nHe paused for a second, letting the minds of his subjects wander: “Yes... do you see it? Crumbling hospitals, fractured roads, brigands roaming the lands with not one soldier of the crown in sight. Enemies on all sides, gnawing at our frontier, to pick at a body paralysed by the cowardice of those at the top. Please, do open your eyes once more – look around.” He paused again. “It is beautiful, is it not? For your children to be allowed to run free once more under the watchful eye of our dutiful men-at-arms, opportunities behind every corner, our most dangerous enemies crushed under the boot of red-blooded Manitoban men and women. But I would be lying to you if I said the work is done – and I think you know that better than me.”\n\nHe rose from his throne. It was time: “Today, I am proclaiming the rebirth of the Britannian Empire, with our Kingdom at its heart. For only we have spilled the blood needed to reclaim the legacy of the Old World legend we were all raised on the tales of. For only we have the mandate and power to bring civilization back to the desolate wastes brimming with low-lives and abominations, none of whom would hesitate before striking us down and undoing all that we have fought for.”\n\n“We stand at a critical juncture. All I ask of you, is to offer your hearts for the most glorious chapter of our reign. You will live on forever in the minds of your descendants – as the generation that marked the course of history.” He raised his fist in the air: “Long live Manitoba. Long live Britannia.”"

To her left stood Alecander in ceremonial armour, holding the crown of Manitoba. To her right, Leif Yorkton, seen in public without the bejewelled headwear for the first time since the fall of the old regime. Eleanor was the first to speak, cementing her authority in the room: “Subjects of the crown – I thank you for taking time out of your day to heed my words. Earlier this month, my father came to me to inform me of his decision to abdicate the throne. His reasons are his own – although rest assured, the choice was deeply rooted in his desire to do best by you all. As the next living heir of House Yorkton, it falls to me to inherit the crown.” She paused for a moment, letting the news simmer.\n\n“Before I proceed, I wish to be fully transparent with you. All that we have done up to this point had the aim of securing the future of the Kingdom. We sought to bring it back from the brink which so many of you experienced on your own skin. All of you have poured blood and sweat in order to help us reach this point. It shall not go unrewarded.” She stood: “From this day forth, the Kingdom of Manitoba will undertake an ambitious programme of reform – to build upon what we have achieved, and to empower those who have helped us achieve it. I shall work tirelessly, day and night, to build a society that shall avoid repeating the mistakes of the past... while working towards a brighter future”.\n\nShe turned to Alecander, nodding. The Knight turned to face her, slowly lowering the crown of the Kingdom onto her head. The camera held the angle for a few seconds, the hymn of the realm blaring in its entirety as the broadcast slowly zoomed out to encompass the royal hall in all its splendour, before eventually cutting out. As the cameras stopped rolling, the new Queen turned to her father, who shrugged his shoulders: “Should leave them hanging between words for a little longer if you ask me – you will get the hang of it eventually.” Eleanor smiled as Alecander concealed a small chuckle.

Yorkton lowered his eyelids as he allowed the warm embrace to coarse through him.\n\n“That’s the last of them milord!” Alecander exclaimed, snapping Yorkton back to reality: “Good,” responded the emperor as he readjusted his coat, the night winds slashing at his cheeks: “Not a peep from these cities Alecander. Their children shall never know the hammer and sickle. Do I make myself clear?” Alecander slammed his fist against his chest, marching off to deliver the orders."

In exchange, it has offered the entirety of Calgary’s digital reserves OR a set of encrypted schematics.\n\nYorkton stared at Alecander for a moment before inquiring: “And why can it not hand over both?” The Knight glanced down for a moment, squinting his eyes: “The... processor, I believe it was, cannot handle such intense decryption work in close succession.” Yorkton opened his mouth to protest before being cut off: “We have put it through the ringer milord, worry not – it speaks the truth.”\n\nYorkton leaned back in his seat. As the Empire grew more powerful, so too would its defensive assets have to follow closely.  But a rogue AI being allowed to run free just beneath his people’s feet... could he truly take the risk?"

Perhaps that is why the good admiral figured it a sound idea to drag the little twerp everywhere he went – toughen him up, really show the world what the kid was made of.\n\nAnd yet a coward he remained – until the very end. The men found him huddled in a corner of his chamber, every man woman and child in his domain placed between himself and righteous justice. Down on his knees, head hanging low, in the freezing cold of Battleford’s main square. Yorkton did not wait for the crowds to form. As soon as he finished spewing his vitriol, he gave a nod to the executioner, who dawned his axe without a moment’s hesitation.\n\nIn the meantime, a squad of knights had been sent to recover the latest raid caches, all to be returned to the royal coffers.

Good, Yorkton thought – less chatter, less fanfare, straight to the point.\n\nThe Couple entered the crumbling building accompanied by a small personal regiment. Both gave a small bow as they lowered themselves down next to the makeshift wooden table brought in from a neighbouring village. John Lockheart spoke first: “Emperor Yorkton, you honour us with your presence.” Amy-Lee Sundell interjected: “Had you given us notice, we would have set up a reception befitting a man of your stature.” John spoke again: “But of course, it is your discretion that sets you apart.”\n\nYorkton cleared his throat: “Yes well... I think you know why I am here.” The Couple glanced at one another, letting out a smile: “Indeed... Your Highness, how familiar are you with the customs of our people?” Yorkton paused for a moment: “Enough to know of your mettle.” Amy-Lee responded: “Charmed.”\n\nJohn resumed: “The Great Stampede only bows to the greatest warriors in the land – now, your reputation may... precede you.” The man scanned Yorkton from head to toe: “But we are yet to test that on our skin.” Amy-Lee interjected: “Indeed.” John continued: “A fight – tempered. A gentlemanly duel between our peoples to decide the fate of the North. One only our best troops shall partake in.”\n\nAmy-Lee interjected once more: “But my love - Is that truly what the legend sitting across from us yearns for?” John gave her a knowing look. “True warriors never hold back after all.

The Knights immediately charged to Yorkton’s side – he halted them, wiping the blood off his face: “What to do with you...” he muttered, a broken, toothy smile spreading across Hawkmoon’s visage.\n\nMost of the men had faced the Electorals on the battlefield before, witnessing friends and colleagues butchered by the legendary commander before their very eyes. What better way to bolster their spirits than letting them experience payback first-hand? And yet... a more secluded execution would make reconstruction less of a headache.\n\nYorkton shoved Hawkmoon’s head back, walking over to the leader of the firing squad.

Now you may or may not share that sentiment – frankly, you are a good man, devoted to his people. And that is all that matters.”\n\n“But I think there is at least one area where a Godly Man and a Good Man can see eye-to-eye: forgiveness.” Just what was Jan getting at? “You might have heard from some of the old-timers, but this isn’t the first time we’ve had a run-in with uh... well she calls herself Leshy. When the Order disbanded, and my brothers and I were driven West, we came to blows. Few made it back - even fewer on their own two legs. As God would have it – I was among them.”\n\nYorkton looked on into the middle distance: “She could have done it my liege... at any moment. Another bit of sustenance for her to make it through the winter season. And yet... she spared me. Made sure I’d know it too.” He chuckled.\n\n“We are the ones who came to her on that day, as we are doing now. I know not that she will be willing to extend mercy once more... but perhaps we could.

A lesser man might have. And yet, along with the curse came a gift; knowledge that a weaker ruler would have used to usher in a self-congratulatory golden age.

He walked up to it, caressing the visage of the man before him. Could not be him – could it? No. Cheeks were too sunken. Eyes too bulbous. A portrait perhaps. Poor form. Would have to dock the squire’s wage. What was his name again?\n\nA knock. A guard walked in: “Sire? We heard a noise from within... are you well?” Yorkton glanced out the window. Ah. Dark. Could have sworn he had breakfast just a few hours prior.\n\nWithout a word, Yorkton waved the man off. He lowered himself back into bed. Would need to be ready to ride at the early hour. Insurrections in the frontier. Was it West? Or South. Curse Alecander, the boy could never get straight to the point.\n\nHe had not seen Eleanor in a while.\n\nHe fell into a deep slumber."

  nf_dln.66.d:0 "Leif Yorkton walked out onto the palace balcony – Eleanor was already there, taking advantage of a brief gap in her schedule to marvel at the sight of the capital city on that unusually clear-skied morning. Leif tightened his scarf, as he shuffled over to his daughter’s side: “Might want to stop by the armoury later, I think some of the newer squires are getting a bit too comfortable with their lunch breaks.” She smirked at him: “Duly noted.”\n\nHe leaned onto the handrail, staring off into the middle-distance for a moment before turning back to his daughter: “They will come for us sooner or later.” Eleanor replied calmly: “When they do, they will find their match.” He shook his head, letting out a small chuckle: “Not if those rifles don’t get polished.” She lightly grabbed Eleanor by the shoulders, looking up and down at her from head to toe. She laid her hand on his, her smile widening.\n\nLeif stepped back, waving his finger at her: “Do not let your head get too big. You have rocked the boat – too vigorously if you ask me.” His visage grew harsher: “Love never trumps fear Eleanor – it will do you good to remember that. Especially on the day I am no longer here to remind you.” The Queen replied, inquisitively: “Until then?” Leif responded: “I will help you carry the burden – no matter what.” He waved his walking stick: “Already got enough legs to stand on as is.”\n\nThe twangs of the town square bell echoed in the distance – it was a brand new day in the Kingdom."

  nf_dln.67.d:0 "Yorkton galloped ahead as soon as he spotted the trail of smoke emanating on the horizon, leaving his personal guard behind. As soon as he emerged from the clearing, he saw it: bonfires littering every corner of Regina, the corpses of men and women alike covering every inch of the immaculate cobblestone roads, the metallic smell of blood thickening the air.\n\nJust at the foot of the valley stood Colonel Reynolds and Colonel Daniels, two high-ranking members of the Fort Cap Hell exiles. He watched as they rounded up another batch of civilians, lining them up underneath the archway leading into the city. Reynolds was the first to spot him: “My Lord, there you are! We are just about wrapped up here.”\n\nYorkton walked up to him. He wanted to say something. Blow up in his face. See him court martialed, even – and yet, he could not. He had agreed to give him and his men a blank cheque in exchange for their support on that faithful uprising. And the last thing he needed at the moment was a pack of roguish psychopaths on the run from authorities this far from the capital.\n\nFor a moment, he locked eyes with a young man in ragged civilian clothing. He looked cold. Scared. In his eyes, a cry for help. Yorkton looked away: “I want the city secured by sundown. Do I make myself clear?” Reynolds cackled: “But of course sire... just let us get on with things and we’ll get that squared away for ya.”\n\nWith that, the King made to leave, the sound of gunfire fading away as he galloped back to camp."

  nf_dln.68.d:0 "Destiny, Hope, the Spectral Cabals, and the horrors they spawned – they were all but breadcrumb trails leading to the real treasure trove. Deep beneath the rubbles of Hawkeye, there resided the final MANIFEST facility. Yorkton would not be taking any chances – flanked by a dozen of his most elite Knights, he moved to storm the laboratory in the early hour of the morning.\n\nBut once inside, the emperor’s caution faded away in an instant. He rushed ahead, a mesmerising glimmer at the back of the dark corridors beckoning him. He was deaf to his men’s calls – as were they to his insatiable ambitions. A weapon perhaps? Advanced armour schematics? What else could possibly justify the madness unleashed onto the North? The deaths of countless of his own countrymen?\n\nHe soon emerged into a bizarrely well-lit room, a vast kaleidoscope of monitors adorning each wall. A loud metallic noise broke the silence. He turned to find the door behind him slammed shut. He was alone... or was he?\n\nThe screens flickered for a moment, the tangled wires beneath his feet emanating a buzzing, incandescent aura. The displays came on one after the other, each the piece of a larger mosaic displaying the figure of a lupine creature – the one Hope warned him of: “Fenrir...” Yorkton whispered underneath his breath. The eldest of the MANIFEST AI siblings, a freak experiment intended to catapult the scientific progress of the Old North into the far-flung future – no matter the cost.\n\nFenrir’s eye narrowed in on the emperor, an ear-piercing digital screech filling the room. Yorkton fell to his knees as he wrestled against the debilitating assault, before being flung towards the back of the room by a sudden jolt of blue lightning emitted by a stray wire. With the wind knocked out of his lungs, the ailing regent struggled to rise back to his feet."

  nf_dln.69.d:0 "Yorkton lightly knocked against Duke Anger’s office door, waiting patiently as the sound of ruffling papers grew ever closer. Eventually, a light gap creaked open, a lone eye scanning the Marshall: “Oh – greetings, Leif. Excuse me for a second.” The door closed for a moment, before suddenly swinging open. The man on the other side appeared weary, his face sunken.\n\n“What can I do for you?” Muttered the duke as he waded past piles of manuscripts scattered across the floor on the way to his desk. Yorkton carefully treaded around them; a mixture of nautical maps, archival records recovered from Anger’s ducal library, old blueprints of the Shieldwall to the East.\n\nCutting straight to the chase, the Marshall pulled out Sophie’s Will from his coat pocket, handing it over to the duke: “Read the final paragraph.” The fallen noble unfolded the document, scanning its final few lines with an increasingly apprehensive look in his eyes: “Just what on earth are you planning? Have you summoned His Majesty to Langenburg yet?” Yorkton’s stern expression spoke for itself. The duke’s gaze fell.\n\n“You are still holding on, my friend. I am here to lighten the burden. No need for it to remain a pipe dream.” The duke pulled away from his desk, sinking his head into his palm: “Still no word from the colonies, I take it,” Yorkton pressed. “None,” responded the duke, an audible knot forming in his throat.\n\nHe looked away for a moment: “What would you have me do, Leif?” Yorkton responded without hesitation: “When the day comes, there is no other man I would rather keep watch over the coastline – and hold the line if need be.” The duke remained silent for a moment, his anguished looks slowly turning muted: “Do you promise Leif?  To check on them? Of what remains?”"
