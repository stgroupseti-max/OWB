  DLN_duchess_sophie_name:0 "Duchess Sophie"
  DUCHESS_SOPHIE_DESC:0 "Sophie Asmanthine has ruled the Grand Duchy through bad and good, having risen to the throne at the meager age of 17 with the death of her father after prolonged times of illness. When she originally inherited the Duchy, it stood at only half its current size, with poverty and crime being rampant across its settlements. To bolster her influence and strength, she established a direct alliance with the House of Yorkton, the family heading the Duchy's second largest city. This alliance elevated them to Counts of Manitoba. Thanks to Sophie's knack for public administration and Joran Yorkton's military mind, chaos was quickly reined in.\n\nIn the years that followed, the Duchy prospered, putting the rest of its peers across the Kingdom to shame. During this time, Sophie oversaw both the founding of the University of Langenburg and the blossoming of Langenburg and Yorkton into true jewels of the realm. By the tenth anniversary of her rise to power, poverty and destitution had become a thing of the past in the Duchy.\n\nAlas, all miracles must come to an end; for Sophie and Langenburg it came with the secession of Winnipeg and the subsequent War of the Republican Coalition. With the Kingdom assailed on all sides, bloodshed inevitably spilled into the Duchy. The hopes of Langeburg's sons and daughters fell onto the shoulders of one man - Joran's son Leif Yorkton. With the enemies at the gate, The marshal gathered an unlikely ragtag coalition that would ultimately annhilate the numerically superior foes, saving the realm.\n\nIn the aftermath of the conflict, Langenburg would be left to pick up the pieces, assimilating the remnants of the numerous duchies that had either fallen or been annexed as a result of the War. Its land size now rivalling that of the very Kingdom which it served, Langenburg found itself as the last Duchy of Manitoba. But the period of relative peace that followed could not overshadow Sophie's ailing figure and lack of heir-apparent..."

  DLN_leif_yorkton_name:0 "Leif Yorkton"
  LEIF_YORKTON_DESC:0 "Leif Yorkton is a living legend within Manitoba, having cemented his status by securing the most unlikely of victories against the Métis armies in the early days of the War of the Republican Coalition. Again and again, he has walked from away from impossible battles unscathed, leaving a trail of broken enemies in his stead. Now, the Sword of The North stands at the precipice of history, determined to restore the kingdom's glorious legacy - no matter the cost."

  DLN_eleanor_yorkton_name:0 "Eleanor Yorkton"
  DLN_eleanor_yorkton_advisor_desc:0 "§Y“War has changed - we should change with it.”§!\n\nBrilliant, determined, and always looking towards the future - Eleanor is her father's daughter after all. And yet, she possesses something The Sword of the North does not - the ingenuity of youth. She studied the events of the War of the First Republican Coalition thoroughly, and from the cool-headed perspective that Manitoba's grieving and resentful veterans simply could not muster. Eleanor ultimately concluded that the Kingdom would be doomed to fall if it failed to both drastically overhaul its technological capabilities and develop more agile battlefield tactics. Gunn did not heed her warnings - would her father see things differently?"
  DLN_ELEANOR_DESC:0 "With her father's very body and mind ailing, Eleanor knew that she would one day inherit all that the Sword of the North had built - and she would not come unprepared. Having spent much of her adulthood embroilled in the politics of court life, it did not take long for the young heir apparent to pick up on the institutional malaise crippling the Kingdom from within. Now armed with the power to see her ambitions through, she readies herself to lay the foundations for a more secure Manitoba. A Manitoba capable of shattering the cycle of violence that has long ensnared the Kingdom."

  DLN_eric_yorkton_name:0 "Eric Yorkton"
  DLN_eric_yorkton_desc:0 "§Y“Hey, give a guy a break.”§!\n\nEric Yorkton never quite gelled with the pomp and excesses attached to the lifestyle of Manitoban nobility, making for the River League early in his adult life in search of fortune and adventure. It took a couple of bad calls and a few powerful enemies for the roguish young man to make his way back home. By that point however, Eric had acquired the experience and connections to be a valuable asset to the Duchy’s merchant class, itself ever hopeful of restoring the Kingdom’s trading monopoly across the far-flung rivers and lakes in the region."

  DLN_tobias_name:0 "Tobias"
  DLN_tobias_desc:0 "§Y“Where she goes, I follow.”§!\n\nTobias's role as Duchess Sophie's loyal butler is only the latest in a long and illustrious career as a servant of the crown. Throughout the decades, the man worked as a public administrator within both the Ducal and Kingdom state apparatuses, fostering a reputation across the land as a competent steward and jack-of-all-trades. No matter the ministry or institution he is posted to, all breathe a sigh of relief whenever they see Tobias step in through the front door."
  TOBIAS_DESC:0 "The Butler"

  DLN_winter_name:0 "Captain Winter"
  DLN_winter_desc:0 "§Y“Someone's gonna have to get their hands dirty.”§!\n\nA direct subordinate of Marshal Leif Yorkton, Captain Winter's upbringing could not have been any more different than his blue-blooded superior. An orphan from the unassuming town of Norquay, he joined the army at a young age, desperately seeking direction and discipline in life. Through the right combination of natural acumen and deferential outlook, he quickly climbed the ranks of the armed forces, eventually transitioning to nurturing up-and-coming talents himself. Now approaching retirement, Captain Winter searches for one last opportunity to prove himself, his limitless ambition only matched by his respect and admiration for the Sword of the North."

  DLN_earl_grey_name:0 "Earl Grey"
  DLN_earl_grey_desc:0 "§Y“Life is a business - and anyone who tells you otherwise just isn't at the top.”§!\n\nSteward, tactician, business magnate - The Earl of Grey had done it all. The man stands out from the decadent minor nobles of Manitoba, having had the foresight to invest his small inheritance into a thriving management consultancy dealing with clients from across the private and public sphere. Whether it's whipping military camps back into shape or overseeing ambitious infrastructure projects, the Earl of Grey has his finger in most pies - and is always on the lookout for the next big score."

  DLN_sylvi_name:0 "Sylvi"
  DLN_sylvi_desc:0 "§Y“Learn the art and set it to one side.”§!\n\nSylvi got her start as a commissioned scavenger, venturing into Old World ruins to secure rare and valuable technologies on behalf of the Duchy. This grew into little more than a side-gig however, after the day Lord Yorkton caught her intonations ringing through the halls of the ducal armoury. Ever the fan of French Opera, the marshal pulled a few strings - and coin purses - to ensure that Sylvi's singing talents would be nurtured and fit to show off to members of Langenburg's high society. To this day, she remains beloved among the political class thanks to her contributions to the Duchy - be it in the form of Pre-War treasures or spellbinding melodies."

  DLN_trader_joel_name:0 "Trader Joel"
  DLN_trader_joel_desc:0 "§Y“With neighbours like these, who needs enemies?”§!\n\nJoel founded Northern Routes during the height of the Kingdom's rule over Manitoba, the shrewd businessman recognising the growing demand for a stopgap servicing merchants making their way coast-to-coast. The subsequent fracturing of the realm, combined with wider regional destabilisation, has since rendered the North a far less attractive destination for traders, leading to declining traffic and forcing the entrepreneur to drastically downscale the company's operations. Now kept afloat in large part thanks to the activities of the neighbouring Rivers League, most cannot deny that the hub's glory days are far behind it."

  DLN_grand_rector_name:0 "The Grand Rector"
  DLN_grand_rector_desc:0 "§Y“Anti-intellectualism sows the seeds of societal collapse.”§!\n\nHaving just graduated as class valedictorian prior to the outbreak of the War of the First Republican Coalition, the Grand Rector was among the few young Manitoban men at the time to avoid the frontlines. Instead, he was handpicked by the King to serve in his cabinet as a crown servant, climbing the ranks to eventually become Chief Scientific Advisor. The fall of the regime did not impede his career progression - men with the right combination of smarts and experience are hard to come by after all. Today, the Grand Rector leads the University of Langenburg with tact and discipline, his years as an administrator manifesting themselves in the form of higher student intake and test results."

  DLN_farmer_david_name:0 "Farmer David"
  DLN_farmer_david_desc:0 "§Y“Never forget who puts food on the table.”§!\n\nThe Langenburg Farmers Union is undoubtedly the most influential lobbying group in the Duchy, one that David leads with aplomb. Under his tenure, the LFM has continuously succeeded in securing ever-higher subsidies and wages, while promoting the funding and widespread adoption of cutting-edge agricultural technologies. The grumbling brass takes good care not to air out their misgivings in public - for they know the Duchy is one well-timed farming strike away from a devastating winter of discontent."

  DLN_colonel_reynolds_name:0 "Colonel Reynolds"
  DLN_colonel_reynolds_desc:0 "§Y“These parasites will get what's comin' to 'em.”§!\n\nIf Colonel Reynolds had even an ounce of clemency left in his bones, it had evaporated with age. The fear he strikes into the hearts of Langenburg's criminals is matched only by the respect he commands among his fellow exiles, earned after leading the escape from Regina amid the Métis uprising. Years after being driven out of their home, Reynolds continues to hold onto the hope of one day leading the march South himself - and delivering righteous justice onto those who had robbed his people of their birthright so long ago."

  DLN_colonel_daniels_name:0 "Colonel Daniels"
  DLN_colonel_daniels_desc:0 "§Y“Tic-tic-tic...”§!\n\nAn enforcer among enforcers, Colonel Daniels tends to enter the scene whenever a troublemaker needs reminding of who's in charge, specialising in unconventional forms of torture involving fire, gunpowder, and explosive chemicals. Having carved out this macabre specialism, it didn't take long for the ducal armoury to employ his services as a consultant, allowing Langenburg to develop some of the most refined demolitions equipment across the Kingdom. Despite this, Daniels's loyalty rests first and foremost with his fellow exiles, and eagerly awaits the day when he is offered the opportunity to test out some of his newer toys on the Métis usurpers."

  DLN_alecander_name:0 "Alecander Weyburn"
  DLN_alecander_desc:0 "§Y“Your wish is my command.”§!\n\nThe Weyburn line is among the most storied and well-respected throughout the Kingdom, a family of battlefield legends composing the backbone of the Knights' Order, Manitoba's elite fighting force.  That was until the aftermath of the War of the First Republican Coalition, where the soldiers' bloody sacrifice was rewarded with the organisation's dismemberment at the hands of the Brandon elites threatened by Marshal Yorkton's successes. It was Yorkton himself who would go on to nurture the young Alecander, after his father, the head of the Order, fell in the struggle. Now in the prime of his youth and with a lifetime of regimented training behind him, Alecander stands as the Sword of the North's loyal right hand. There is not a man in he would not be prepared to point his blade at if it meant restoring the family name and carrying out the will of he who made him the person he is today."

  DLN_Goderick_name:0 "Goderick"
  DLN_Goderick_desc:0 "§Y“I forge - that's what I do.”§!\n\nGoderick was just one of the several veterans forced to step back from the battlefield following a debilitating injury incurred during the War of the First Republican Coalition. Following a lengthy period of soul-searching - as well as some timely assistance from the Duchy's social services programme - he moved to harness his experience as a field aide to secure a position as ducal armor-smith. Goderick stands out from his peers, his experiences on the frontlines having provided him with the first-hand insight to address some of the most grievous oversights found in the designs of the soldiers' standard-issue equipment."

  DLN_joshua_name:0 "Joshua"
  DLN_joshua_desc:0 "§Y“A good plan never survives first contact.”§!\n\nA former member of the Knights' Order, Joshua was always the first one in, and the last one out, specialising in reconnaissance and covert operations. After the organisation was disbanded, he roamed the North as a mercenary, offering up his skills to even the most unsavoury of clients for the sake of making a quick buck. But rumour has it that trouble is brewing in Manitoba - and he is not one to pass up an opportunity. There aren't many more tricks left for this old dog to learn, but a few he could certainly teach."

  DLN_bellores_name:0 "Duchess Bellores"
  DLN_bellores_desc:0 "§Y“One day, we shall be welcomed back as heroes.”§!\n\nDespite the difficult life she has lived, Duchess Bellores continues to hold onto the hope that a bright future is ahead - for both herself and her House.  In her heart of hearts, she is convinced all these experiences will one day enable her to restore her home and the Royal Port within to their former glory. Until then, she dutifully serves the Duchy of Langenburg as a shield against her enemies - be they at land or sea."

  DLN_duke_Anger_name:0 "Duke Anger"
  DLN_duke_Anger_desc:0 "§Y“What lies beyond the horizon?”§!\n\nIn the before times, the Duchy of Angers's strategic location within the Kingdom made it the ideal launchpad for Manitoba's colonial ventures to the East. The titular Duke holds onto those dreams of yonder, undeterred by reports of the horrors that lie beyond Lake Winnipeg. Whilst some have labelled his ambitions as foolish, they have nevertheless pushed the noble to become one of the most knowledgeable men within the Kingdom when it comes to sea-faring endeavours, earning him the respect of several of its peers."

  DLN_eliza_name:0 "Eliza"
  DLN_eliza_desc:0 "§Y“Whoever said the sky is the limit?”§!\n\nEliza first got her wings in Eagle Rock, working as a courier and mechanic for the hub's Northern division. One critical engine malfunction and crash landing later, she found refuge in Sophie's court, the matriarch looking to keep the young woman close should her talents ever prove of interest to the Duchy. Stranded in a flightless society, Eliza has kept herself busy with odd-jobs throughout Langenburg, spending her free time gazing at the clouds above, and dreaming of one day piercing through to the clear-blue skies beyond."

  DLN_johannes_name:0 "Marshal Johannes"
  DLN_johannes_desc:0 "§Y“You would be surprised what a few push-ups on a large enough scale can accomplish.”§!\n\nJohannes is among the few living remnants of Absalon's reign, a former Duchy of the Kingdom lost to the Bloody Electoral and the scarlet blizzard. Even during the noble family's rule, the marshal spent much of his working life in Yorkton's shadow, the man's prospects crippled by his insecurities and rigid methodicalness. In many ways, the fall of the Duchy proved a blessing for Johannes, allowing him to carve out a reputation as a competent, if slightly unambitious leader unburdened by the expectations the world had set upon him."

  DLN_poet_jack_name:0 "Jack"
  DLN_poet_jack_desc:0 "§Y“90 minutes for a buck and a warm bed.”§!\n\nOne of the few everyday celebrities found in the Duchy, a visit from Jack is a treat for any tavern owner in the periphery. The wandering busker leads an ever-growing trail of devoted fans wherever he travels, leading to some of the largest crowds the more minor settlements of Langenburg have seen. His performances have earned him the admiration and love of the Duchy's subjects - as well as the respect of many of its higher ups, thanks to his frequent recounting and embellishment of the army's most glorious campaigns."

  DLN_stable_master_name:0 "Aksel"
  DLN_stable_master_desc:0 "§Y“All I need is a week, a gun and a few cans of soup.”§!\n\nIf there is one thing Aksel learned over the course of countless skirmishes is that battle is a numbers' game: if one has the resources to outlast the enemy, they will always come out on top.  It was this mind for logistics that earned him a place of prominence in the ducal armoury, and a seat at the royal table whenever the details of a new campaign were being hashed out. Despite his quick rise to prominence, he never shied away from the frontlines, granting him the battlefield experience and respect of his peers to become one of the Kingdom's most versatile soldiers."

  DLN_luke_name:0 "Luke"
  DLN_luke_desc:0 "§Y“If I don't, who will?”§!\n\nLuke's friends and family long held that the young man was destined for career stardom in the military, his natural talent and fierce intellect plain for all to see. But as the number of abominations flooding out of the blighted woods grew in recent years, so did his motivation to stay behind to protect the ones he loved. Now boasting years of experience leading the Porcupine Hill militia, Luke is deemed one of the Duchy's most valuable assets in the frontier - one that will keep fighting on until the dwellers of the North can sleep soundly at night."

  DLN_sobrek_name:0 "Sobrek"
  DLN_sobrek_desc:0 "§Y“If it shoots, it *hick* shoots.”§!\n\nSobrek might never be allowed anywhere near a position of influence within the ducal armoury, but that is not to mean his talents go unappreciated by those at the top. The man is never more focused than when inebriated on the assembly line, putting together basic rifles in a trance, and at a speed unparallel with that of his more clear-headed colleagues. A couple barrels may come out crooked here and there, but that is a small price to pay for the sake of an industrious military complex."

  DLN_couple_name:0 "The Couple"
  DLN_couple_desc:0 "§Y“We shall serve - for as long as it takes.”§!\n\nThrough a suprising series of events, John and Amy-Lee found themself as the helm of Alberta under the stewardship of Emperor Yorkton. In spite of the bloody exchange that preceded their regency, the Couple has already made quick progress in rebuilding their domain from the grounds-up."

  DLN_hope_name:0 "Hope"
  DLN_hope_desc:0 "§Y“I'd love to help!.”§!\n\nAmong the children of MANIFEST, Hope stands as the odd-one out. Ever upbeat and always willing to lend a hand, she has already been playing a critical role in the development of Britannia's military technology. It is the Emperor's hope that the AI's knack for warfare will prove a reliable path to peace."
