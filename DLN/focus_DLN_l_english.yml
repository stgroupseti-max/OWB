  dln_last_duchy:0 "The Last Duchy, Langenburg"
  dln_last_duchy_desc:0 "Langenburg is the last standing Duchy of the Kingdom of Manitoba, having survived attempts by both the Republicans and Electorals to relegate us to the history books."
  dln_miracle_on_border:0 "The Miracle on the Border"
  dln_miracle_on_border_desc:0 "The War of the Republican Coalition appeared doomed from the start. Winnipeg's rebellion deprived the Kingdom of its industrial heartland, forcing it to stretch its resources beyond the breaking point once the Métis Congress and the Electorals entered the conflict. Amidst the fighting, Langenburg appeared easy prey. And yet the Duchy would, in the end, prove to be their burial ground."
  dln_yorktons:0 "The Yorktons"
  dln_yorktons_desc:0 "The Yorktons have served Langenburg's ducal family faithfully since before the inception of the Kingdom. They are, in all effects, the backbone of the Duchy's court. Hailing from a long line of primarily educators and judges, the family's role has had to evolve in recent years to ensure Langenburg's continued survival in the increasingly uncertain Northern wastes."
  dln_state_of_the_duchy:0 "The State of the Duchy"
  dln_state_of_the_duchy_desc:0 "The yearly State of the Duchy address is upon us - a chance for the Duchess to give her subjects a glimpse of what's ahead! The marshal is to receive the written statement by royal courier ahead of the ceremony, as per tradition."
  dln_investments:0 "New Investments"
  dln_investments_desc:0 "While our economy has slumped in recent times, Eleanor's mission to the royal capital has bore fruit. All it took were a few well-placed handshakes and a handful of minor concessions for us to secure some of the largest investments the Duchy has ever seen!"
  dln_university:0 "Re-opening the University"
  dln_university_desc:0 "The doors to the Grand University of Langenburg were sealed during the War of the Republican Coalition, with the vast majority of students ending up conscripted. But with tensions cooling in recent years, the stage is set for the grand re-opening!"
  dln_new_opportunities:0 "New Opportunities & CO."
  dln_new_opportunities_desc:0 "In an effort to manage our growing portfolio, a new royal company will be founded, New Opportunities & CO., to act as an intermediary between the Duchy and private entities seeking investment."
  dln_reforms:0 "Reforming the Bureaucracy"
  dln_reforms_desc:0 "While Sophie is our de-facto ruler, the Duchy still employs a large and complex network of bureaucrats to run the day-to-day operations of the state. In recent years, the number of Crown Servants has bloated beyond manageable levels - some targeted reforms are called for."
  dln_anti_corruption:0 "New Anti-Corruption Measures"
  dln_anti_corruption_desc:0 "Embezzlement is a crime punishable with a life sentence."
  dln_legal_code:0 "Amend the Legal Code"
  dln_legal_code_desc:0 "Langenburg's legal code has been largely neglected ever since the outbreak of the War of the Republican Coalition. As a result, the current laws are unequipped to deal with the leaps and bounds made by the Duchy since. We shall set out an ambitious plan of reforms to fix that!"
  dln_military_reforms:0 "Yorkton's Military Reforms"
  dln_military_reforms_desc:0 "Langenburg's recent military successes are not about to make the marshal complacent. The ducal armoury is hard at work producing the equipment needed to give our army a leg up in its demolition capabilities."
  dln_new_rifles:0 "Standardization of New Rifles"
  dln_new_rifles_desc:0 "Standard Langenburgian doctrine holds that if it fails to kill the target on the first bullet, fire again until the target in question is neutralized before reporting the faulty rifle."
  dln_recruitment:0 "Recruitment Districts"
  dln_recruitment_desc:0 "One of the Duchy's greatest sources of vulnerability has always been its low population, making for a relatively leen standing army. In an effort to mitigate this, marshal Yorkton has moved to propose the introduction of recruitment districts to more accurately track eligible conscripts."
  dln_long_reign:0 "The Duchess's Long Benevolent Reign"
  dln_long_reign_desc:0 "Our Benevolent Duchess has weathered all kinds of storms, be they of Republican or Royal nature. Among the ashes of the past, only her Duchy stands firm in the tides of history. Long May She Reign! And Long Live Langenburg!"
  dln_time_stops:0 "Time Stops, and Once Again Marches Forward"
  dln_time_stops_desc:0 "The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference..."
  dln_race_against_history:0 "A Race Against History"
  dln_race_against_history_desc:0 "...but only if he is prepared to sacrifice everything."
  dln_expand_armory:0 "Expand the Yorkton Armory"
  dln_expand_armory_desc:0 "During the War of the Republican Coalition, Yorkton's Armory established itself as the Duchy's primary arms producer and supplier. In light of Langenburg's limited manpower, Sophie failed to see much point in expanding its manufacturing capabilities following the conflict. With the dark clouds accumulating on the horizon, that will need to change..."
  dln_industrial_backbone:0 "The Marshal's Industrial Backbone"
  dln_industrial_backbone_desc:0 "For us to come out victorious in a prolonged war, we will require an industry to rival that of the Kingdom. Time is of the essence - I shall have to call in some favours with the Earl of Grey."
  dln_relocate_guns:0 "Relocating The Guns"
  dln_relocate_guns_desc:0 "If there is one thing the Kingdom has more than enough of, that would be guns. So overflowing with rifles is the Royal Armory, that anyone would be hard pressed to notice if a dozen or-so crates' worth of equipment went unregistered..."
  dln_buy_medicine:0 "Medicine Acquisition"
  dln_buy_medicine_desc:0 "It will not take long for the royal authorities to start questioning the suspicious volume of major workplace accidents filed by the Duchy over the past couple of months. By the time they come knocking however, it will be too late."
  dln_knights_plot:0 "The Knights' Plot"
  dln_knights_plot_desc:0 "To the Knights, this was a day long awaited. By Yorkton's orders and Alecander Weyburn's hands, the Banishment of the Knights decree shall be rendered void in Langenburg. The veteran warriors and their descendants are already flocking to the capital, eager to fight alongside their Lord once more."
  dln_old_loyalists:0 "Yorkton's Old Loyalists"
  dln_old_loyalists_desc:0 "At its prime, the Order Of The Archangel was a truly terrifying force. Any one Knight was capable of cutting down an entire squad of men all on their lonesome. Clad head-to-toe in the Kingdom's finest armour, their mere presence on the battlefield was capable of swinging the tides of battle on morale alone. With many of those same men under our command once more, we stand ready to reclaim the days of glory."
  dln_minor_reforms:0 "Minor Reforms"
  dln_minor_reforms_desc:0 "The Kingdom's forces dwarf ours in manpower alone. If we are to level the playing field, we will have to take what we can get - and fast. A quick and dirty recruitment drive in the frontier is a good start."
  dln_citizen_militias:0 "Citizen Militias"
  dln_citizen_militias_desc:0 "Langenburg's Northern frontiers are treacherous, and our resources can only stretch so far. In response, citizen militias have started cropping up in some of the more remote settlements. Not exactly a formidable fighting force by any means - but in the time available to us, they will have to do."
  dln_new_reforms:0 "New Military Reforms"
  dln_new_reforms_desc:0 "We cannot cut corners when it comes to readying our troops for what is ahead. The more rigorous training exercises will be time-consuming no doubt - but they could spell the difference between victory and annhilation."
  dln_marshall_men:0 "The Marshal's Men"
  dln_marshall_men_desc:0 "Several retired veterans have made their way to the capital in recent months to pay their respect to the late Duchess. It did not take much convincing for most to stay."
  dln_last_will:0 "Last Will and Testament"
  dln_last_will_desc:0 "The guns have been mustered, the knights have been readied, and the men have been riled. But before we can march onto Brandon, hearts and minds alike would have to be won."
  dln_revise_doctrine:0 "Revising Our Doctrine"
  dln_revise_doctrine_desc:0 "It did not take long for the veterans to shake off the rust. Mere weeks into the campaign, they are already coming to me, eager to share some of their insights."
  dln_w_campaign:0 "The W Campaign"
  dln_w_campaign_desc:0 "Press releases, recruitment posters, and the occasional parade - the internally dubbed "W Campaign" has proven a smashing success thus far. When the people wander their towns, asking themsleves questions about the conflict - we will be sure to get to them before anyone else does."
  dln_call_arms_manufactors:0 "Call In Favours with Arms Manufacturers"
  dln_call_arms_manufactors_desc:0 "We still have unclosed tabs among some of the black market's largest arms dealers. It is about time we paid them a visit."
  dln_wartime_recruitment:0 "Wartime Recruitment"
  dln_wartime_recruitment_desc:0 "Five whole acres to any able-bodied man willing to serve until dismissal. Hardly a better deal than that in the periphery."
  dln_count_king:0 "The Count That Became King"
  dln_count_king_desc:0 "The settlements have been encircled, the capital's battlements have fallen, and the last of the King's men have laid down their arms. It is time to reap the rewards."
  dln_fate_monarchy:0 "The Fate of the Old Monarchy"
  dln_fate_monarchy_desc:0 "The clock strikes midnight for the aristocrats and their corpse King. Soon the record shall be set straight, and every debt will be repaid in kind."
  dln_reorg:0 "Reorganizing The Manitobian Army"
  dln_reorg_desc:0 "In an effort to rebuild the Kingdom's shattered army as quickly as possible, I have elected to offer pardons to all military personnel outside the top brass willing to remain enlisted. Very few have opted for the gaol for the sake of the rotten nobility."
  dln_realm:0 "Reinvigorating The Realm"
  dln_realm_desc:0 "War is never cheap, but when waged among states, the victor can expect to make up at least some of the losses. Not so much the case for internal scuffles. Over the next few months, we will have to engage in an extensive reconstruction effort - lest the people begin yearning for the old regime."
  dln_kingdom:0 "A New Age For The Kingdom"
  dln_kingdom_desc:0 "With the army whipped back into shape and the claimants dealt with, my rule over the Kingdom of Manitoba is secured. But that was always going to be a relatively straightforward affair. Only now, does the Kingdom have the tools needed to correct years of mismanagement and incompetence by those at the top - and I will make sure the people are aware of that."
  dln_offensive:0 "Manitoba on the Offensive"
  dln_offensive_desc:0 "At the height of its rule, the Kingdom of Manitoba was a true jewel of the Wasteland, boasting far-flung Duchies that fuelled its rich and diverse industries. Decades of war and mismanagement have unravelled much of this prosperity, shrinking the realm's size and power. Nevertheless, history has given me a unique opportunity to restore our glorious legacy - and I intend to grab it with both hands."
  dln_lessons:0 "Lessons of the Rebellion"
  dln_lessons_desc:0 "If there is one thing that our victory over Gunn's crumbling regime has proven is that even a patchy, tenuous, and hastily assembled coalition can best a mightier opponent. This will be critical to bear in mind as we move to assimilate the disparate tribes hugging our borders."
  dln_where_no_one:0 "Where No One Goes Anymore"
  dln_where_no_one_desc:0 "The Northern frontier has long held the most treacherous lands across the Kingdom, the horrors roaming the neighbouring Blighted Woods frequently wandering into our settlements to wreak havoc. It is time for us to take some responsibility and fight back against these abominations. That journey begins by laying the groundwork for the battles to come."
  dln_worst_loss:0 "The Worst of Our Loses"
  dln_worst_loss_desc:0 "Winnipeg's secession nearly killed the Kingdom, and were it not for the blood and sweat of my men, it would have. If the rebels thought for even a moment that that clobbering would be the end of it - they have got another thing coming."
  dln_red_fern:0 "Cracking the Red Fern"
  dln_red_fern_desc:0 "Red Fern is understood to be an especially powerful narcotic stimulant. In its pure form, it is resolutely banned from circulation within the Kingdom. Recently however, our scientists were able to extract a hitherto hidden medical compound found to counteract even the strongest of infections. It may be vital to our success in the Blighted Woods."
  dln_wicked:0 "The Wicked Forest"
  dln_wicked_desc:0 "No one is quite sure of the full extent of the depravity hiding out in the Blighted Woods, creatures made twisted by unforgiving environments and perverted science. Only the most loyal among the Knights volunteered for the campaign. Those that shall return home will be celebrated as heroes for the rest of their lives. Those who do not shall be remembered as such for as long as the Kingdom stands."
  dln_madness:0 "The Madness MANIFEST Reeks"
  dln_madness_desc:0 "The further we push, the more resistance we meet, the more blood we spill. We cannot - will not stop. We will uncover the source of the horrors that blight our lands and put a stop to it. No matter the cost."
  dln_remains:0 "What Remains of the North"
  dln_remains_desc:0 "The Scarlet Blizzard, the Frostlurks, the endless thickets... some men would argue that staking a claim over this hellscape is little more than a fool's errand. Some men would say it would be best to be content with what we already have.\n\nSome men would rather go down in history as mere footnotes."
  dln_fate:0 "The Fate of the Old MANIFEST Facility"
  dln_fate_desc:0 "At heart of the Blighted Woods, behind waves of freaks and monsters, lies the abandoned MANIFEST facility, the sound of metal and generators spilling beyond its walls. Someone - something - had re-awakend the dormant laboratory. It fell to us to put it to sleep for good."
  dln_center:0 "Striking at the Center"
  dln_center_desc:0 "Bohdan... A farcical holy man and his band of zealots feasting on the carcass of the Kingdom's breadbasket. They will soon learn that in these lands, there is only One they ought to be bowing to."
  dln_banners:0 "The Reclamation of Winnipeg"
  dln_banners_desc:0 "Our current forces will not do. Officers across the Kingdom are scrambling to mobilise all able-bodied reserves. Their cry is being heard up and down the settlements of Manitoba:\n\n§GYour time is now, King and Country needs You!§!"
  dln_avenge:0 "Avenge the Republican Wars"
  dln_avenge_desc:0 "From East to West, from the Northern lakes to the capital city, a cacophany of clanking metal and patriotic tunes. The time has come. The lion roars.\n\n§GThe Lord Awaits!§!"
  dln_return:0 "The Return to Winnipeg"
  dln_return_desc:0 "The guns fall silent at last. Peace reigns over my homeland. Never again shall blood be spilled on Manitoban soil. I will make sure of that..."
  dln_republicans:0 "The Republicans and Oligarchs"
  dln_republicans_desc:0 "No one has ever made history by skirting around the toughest choices."
  dln_pests:0 "The Pests on the Lake"
  dln_pests_desc:0 "Lake Winnipegosis's Eastern coastline is home to all sorts of wretched scum, ranging from garden-variety raiders to semi-autonomous rump settlements propped up by the old regime. Clearing out the riff-raff will make our waters safer while strengthening our position against our enemies in the region."
  dln_golden_age:0 "A New Golden Age"
  dln_golden_age_desc:0 "The Kingdom has been restored to its former glory. I should be on the field, celebrating with the men... and yet, I feel a little woozy. I shall get an early night in - when I wake, it will be a new day for Manitoba."
  dln_jewel:0 "The Jewel of the Old Empire"
  dln_jewel_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to our younglings, the original capital of the Kingdom of Manitoba was not Brandon, but Winnipeg, King Gunn I deeming it perfectly positioned to hold the seat of power. As such, the Imperial Palace and its court reside in the settlement to this day, albeit in disrepair following years of Republican negligence... yet another legacy of the War to be corrected."
  dln_imperial_palace:0 "Restore the Imperial Palace"
  dln_imperial_palace_desc:0 "In The North-end of Winnipeg lie the ruins of Imperial Palace, the rubble left for all to see as a pathetic Republican propoaganda stunt. And yet, here we stand again - while they hang from the light posts. Let us scrub what little is left of their memory."
  dln_academy:0 "The Academy of Royal Science"
  dln_academy_desc:0 "Conventional weaponry alone is not enough to win wars, especially in times like these. If we are to hold onto what we have fought for, Manitoba is to seize its place on the cutting edge of military innovation. And that process begins by giving our next generation of scholars a place to thrive in."
  dln_winni:0 "Winnipegian Industry"
  dln_winni_desc:0 "Being the beating heart of the Kingdom since its inception, Winnipeg has been home to many of my predecessors' industrial concerns. Under the republicans, this honoured tradition came to a halt. In order to restore what was lost, we shall pour everything we have into the city."
  dln_home:0 "We're Home"
  dln_home_desc:0 "It took an intense industrial shock therapy to bring the capital back to what it once was, but the resulting splendour is undeniable. Come one, come all; Manitoba's banner flutters proudly over the storied city once more."
  dln_resettle:0 "Resettle Absalon"
  dln_resettle_desc:0 "The resettlement of the former Duchy of Absalon is now in full swing. Already, some of our most ambitious pilgrims are adapting tried and tested farming techniques to these once accursed lands, laying the foundations for a fresh start in the Kingdom's frontier."
  dln_resettle_city:0 "Resetteling the City"
  dln_resettle_city_desc:0 "Although quickly abandoned amidst the chaos brought on by the MANIFEST facility, Hudson Bay City still holds the remnants of some of the Kingdom's most developed trade and commercial infrastructures. As soon as word of the Knights' successes and exploits reached the capital, hundreds of subjects caught the scent of opportunity and made for the ruins of the settlement in search of fortune."
  dln_investment:0 "Seek Investment for the Resettlement"
  dln_investment_desc:0 "A home lacking the right foundations is destined to collapse in on itself."
  dln_settle_country_side:0 "Settle the Country Side"
  dln_settle_country_side_desc:0 "Few settlers were initially compelled to venture into the deepest recesses of the woods, perhaps understandably concerned that some of the horrors brought on by MANIFEST yet lingered in the shadows. Nevertheless, promises of cheap land and generous grants proved sufficient incentive for some of our braver pilgrims."
  dln_open_for:0 "Absalon Open for Business"
  dln_open_for_desc:0 "The businesses are chugging, and the people are eager. That is all a land needs to thrive."
  dln_last_rec:0 "The Last of the Imperial Lands"
  dln_last_rec_desc:0 "The bulk of the Kingdom's former lands are home to red-blooded Manitobans once more.  But can they sleep soundly knowing traitors and enemies continue to hug our frontier? I certainly cannot."
  dln_scars:0 "The Last Scars of the Republican Wars"
  dln_scars_desc:0 "Whilst admittedly one of the more minor affronts of the Republican War, the freaks to the West continue to hold onto some of our former lands. Individually, they are weak - yet it is their bond that makes them a truly terrifying thing, one that risks bogging us down in a never-ending, bloody stalemate. Some apt diplomacy may assist us in resolving the matter quickly and painlessly."
  dln_settler:0 "The Nomads"
  dln_settler_desc:0 "The natives of the Iron Confederacy have a history of being chased out of the lands they settle for one reason or another. A worse neighbour than one with nothing to lose you could not find."
  dln_colonies:0 "The Colonies Beyond the Shieldwall"
  dln_colonies_desc:0 "In the golden years of the Kingdom, several colonies were established along the shores of Lake Winnipeg in an attempt to settle Eastern Manitoba. The lines of communication fell apart long ago, and efforts to re-establish them were not forthcoming. Just what on earth is going on out East?"
  dln_integrity:0 "The Integrity of the Kingdom Restored"
  dln_integrity_desc:0 "We have gone beyond simply matching the splendour of days past, carving out buffer zones and securing our far-flung frontiers for our subjects looking to make a new start away from the bustling inner regions. The young are being flooded with new opportunities - and the old can rest easy knowing their children's future is secured."
  dln_manitoba_back:0 "Manitoba Is Back!"
  dln_manitoba_back_desc:0 "We have seized our place within the halls of history. But what is keeping us from surpassing the feats of empires past? Nothing I say. Go and spread the flag of Manitoba across the land my children; our story is yet to be written."
  dln_manitoba_dam:0 "The Manitobian Dam"
  dln_manitoba_dam_desc:0 "Under the stewardship of the brigands to the North, the Grand Rapids Dam has unsurprisingly fallen into disrepair. By overhauling this key asset, we stand to generate plenty of new jobs, drawing in eager and ambitious workers from across the Kingdom and beyond."
  dln_return_law:0 "The Return of Law and Order"
  dln_return_law_desc:0 "With our restoration efforts winding to a close, we can afford to scale back on the size of our standing army. Several soldiers will be redeployed to settlements across the Kingdom large and small, to live out quiet lives keeping their loved ones safe from everyday brigands and ruffians."
  dln_man_res:0 "The Grand Manitobian Restoration"
  dln_man_res_desc:0 "As we begin rebuilding the Kingdom of Manitoba, it will be crucial to ensure that we are working with sound foundations. By succeeding on the home-front, we will pave the way for smoother and better resourced campaigns. To this end, whilst many of our storied Duchies continue to exist in name only, they present useful administrative boundaries for a methodical reconstruction effort."
  dln_duc_bra:0 "The Duchy of Brandon"
  dln_duc_bra_desc:0 "For all of Gunn II's missteps and ailing grip on the realm, Brandon has remained the Kingdom's seat of power for years. As could be expected, the majority of Manitoba's most impressive minds, buildings and commercial activities reside here. They will lay the foundations for our rebirth."
  dln_land_clear:0 "The Grand Land Clearing"
  dln_land_clear_desc:0 "With Brandon garnering something of a hub status in recent years, the surrounding provinces have either been neglected or been relegated to tacky sightseeing sites for wealthy tourists. The region is well overdue for targeted development, something we are well equipped to provide."
  dln_ref:0 "Welcome Refugees Home"
  dln_ref_desc:0 "As our successes over the course of the war for the Kingdom mounted, subjects in the regions made for the capital in search of refuge from the advancing frontlines. With the conflict at an end and Brandon's infrastructure stretched beyond capacity, the time has come for our citizens to return home."
  dln_forgotten_city:0 "The Forgotten City"
  dln_forgotten_city_desc:0 "With Brandon securing more and more under-the-table subsidies over the years, the city of Strathclair faced steady decline. Businesses migrated South, leaving the settlemnt to devolve into little more than a ghost town. Yet another wound inflicted by the noble class - yet another rotten legacy I shall undo."
  dln_royal:0 "The Royal Road"
  dln_royal_desc:0 "The Royal Road was a project first conceived half-a-century ago by the Brandon family. Its initial intent was to connect the cities of Brandon, Langenburg and Dawfin to bring the West's economy up-to-speed with the industrial heartland of Winnipeg. Alas, the project was foolishly never deemed a high-enough priority to receive adequate funding. But I know better - a house divided against itself will never stand."
  dln_open_door:0 "An Open Door for Our Old Subjects"
  dln_open_door_desc:0 "The war for the Kingdom has claimed many lives, lives which we desperately need at this critical juncture. Thankfully, a most obvious solution was brought to my attention. By adopting a “forgive and forget” policy towards the subjects of our breakaway territories, we should be able to encourage immigration from neighbouring lands. This will strenghten our economy while crippling that of our foes."
  dln_home_bra:0 "The Home of the Dukes of Brandon"
  dln_home_bra_desc:0 "Brandon is the most storied Duchy of the Kingdom, having been the home of many-a Manitoban rulers since the formation of the realm. My takeover has undermined this dynastic status-quo, even more so than Gunn II's. In demonstrating our commitment to the wellbeing of the Duchy, we have breathed new life into its economy, while putting the concerns of old loyalists to rest."
  dln_duc_ang:0 "The Duchy of Angers"
  dln_duc_ang_desc:0 "The raiders and mercs that had set up shop on the lake's shores left behind all sorts of rickety, half-built vehicles clearly intended for cowardly hit-and-run tactics - typical. Nothing that could not be repurposed for more noble ends however..."
  dln_royal_ins:0 "The Royal Institute of Medicine"
  dln_royal_ins_desc:0 "While much of the flora found in the Blightwoods is both incredibly hostile and dangerous, their medicinal properties are truly awe-inspiring. With enough money and research, we could be looking at a scientific breakthrough for the ages. To this end, I have instructed that a new medical university be built at the heart of Hudson Bay City."
  dln_linger:0 "The Memories of the Past No Longer Linger"
  dln_linger_desc:0 "The horrors of MANIFEST and the Blighted Woods have been put to bed. The burden of the memories sit with those who hold the power to take action, should the need arise once more. But for everybody else, the time has come to start a new chapter. And that process begins by scrubbing away the perverted legacy left behind by the abominations."
  dln_trade_flow:0 "Let the Trade Flow"
  dln_trade_flow_desc:0 "By reclaiming and securing the lands of the former Duchy of Absalon, the Saskatchewan has become open to us once again. It did not take long for our traders to establish contact with everyone from the nomadic tribes of the far North to some of the newer settlements of Alberta. The royal coffers have never looked fuller for it."
  dln_duc_warwick:0 "The Duchy of Warwick"
  dln_duc_warwick_desc:0 "Amid the fires and destruction of the war for Regina and the surrounding lands, some of the once lush and pristine forests remain standing. The trees within used to boast some of the finest wood this side of the Great Lakes, going on to inspire the Duchy's unmatched lumbering industries and robotics. Alas, we could only recover a fraction of that technology."
  dln_fell:0 "The Ones Which Fell First"
  dln_fell_desc:0 "The territories of the Métis Congress were among the first to break away from the Kingdom, the rebels successfully driving our men back across the Assiniboine following a bloody insurgency. To many of our subjects, this marked the beginning of the realm's decline. Having recently reversed this historic debacle, those same subjects may be convinced that the worst is now behind us."
  dln_weyburn:0 "Restore the House of Weyburn"
  dln_weyburn_desc:0 "The Weyburn line once held domain over a key settlement within the former Duchy, fiercely defying the Métis rebels until the bitter end. Their loyalty shall at last be rewarded - the Archangel will finally be able to return home."
  dln_regina:0 "The Future of Regina"
  dln_regina_desc:0 "The Capital of the illegitimate Métis government has fallen. Winning the war was not quite the challenge I envisioned - winning the peace here will be the true test of leadership."
  dln_mech:0 "Mechanics Universalis"
  dln_mech_desc:0 "By promising amnesty to the engineers, technicians and scientists working under the Métis Congress, we have equipped the Kingdom with the know-how to deploy combat-ready robots. In doing so, we shall ensure that the flesh of our brave sons and daughters is shielded behind layers of impenetrable steel."
  dln_duc_abs:0 "The Duchy of Absalon"
  dln_duc_abs_desc:0 "We have successfully resettled much of the former Duchy of Absalon and restored the bulk of its old commercial activities. It will not take long for these once god-forsaken lands to become among the Kingdom's most profitable."
  dln_merc:0 "The Fate of the Merc Settlers"
  dln_merc_desc:0 "You would not exactly want these gentlemen as your neighbours."
  dln_lake:0 "The Pearl of Lake Winnipegosis"
  dln_lake_desc:0 "Breathtaking, well-developed, and perfectly positioned to become a hub for our Kingdom's Eastern frontier. With just a bit of elbow grease, the small fishing settlemnt could become a true jewel in our crown."
  dln_seats:0 "The Seats Are Now Empty"
  dln_seats_desc:0 "Lonesome nights leave a desire to relive the past, something ancient which can no longer be grasped. I keep telling myself... and yet the memories linger."
  dln_began:0 "The Duchy of Langenburg"
  dln_began_desc:0 "Our ancestors fought and bled to lay the foundations that would elevate us to the throne. There is only one Duchy whose name shall go down in history for bringing Manitoba back from the brink. Langenburg. The Duchy that never fell."
  dln_arms:0 "Expand Yorkton's Arms Industry"
  dln_arms_desc:0 "Under Father's stewardship, the city of Yorkton grew into one of the North's leading luxury arms manufacturers. With just a small investment and a more... hands-on approach, we could expand production to cater to even the lowliest of footsoldiers."
  dln_university_re:0 "The University of Langenburg"
  dln_university_re_desc:0 "The University of Langenburg holds the honour of being the first of its kind within the Kingdom to open its doors. Sadly, the onset of the War of the Republican Coalition would ultimately force them shut. With our grip on the region strenghtening, we would only stand to gain from reversing this historic embarrassment."
  dln_arms_hands:0 "Arms From Yorkton in Every Hand"
  dln_arms_hands_desc:0 "The first few crates of the latest-model infrantry rifles from Yorkton are already making their way to the armory. Sturdy, accurate, and light as a feather - I expected nothing less."
  dln_expand_langenburg:0 "Expand the Capital"
  dln_expand_langenburg_desc:0 "Our gaze has shifted South over the course of the reconstruction effort, and the storied city of Langenburg is long overdue for some love. The latest round of investments aims to offer more employment opportunities across a wide range of sectors. The rest will fall into place..."
  dln_royal_sci:0 "The Royal Science Exhibition"
  dln_royal_sci_desc:0 "In an effort to promote the Kingdom's technological prowess to the world, the Royal Scientific Advisors have proposed we host an exhibition in Langenburg."
  dln_last_line:0 "The Last of Her Linage"
  dln_last_line_desc:0 "Are you watching over me, Sophie?"
  dln_duc_daw:0 "The Duchy of Dawfin"
  dln_duc_daw_desc:0 "Having gained full control of the Greater Dawfin coastline, it did not take long for our Crown Servants to begin overhauling the Kingdom's chronically underfunded naval programme. It would be key to restoring our military and economic influence over Lake Winnipegosis."
  dln_restore:0 "Restore the Royal Port"
  dln_restore_desc:0 "The Royal Port of Dawfin and its surroundings had fallen into disrepair following the devastating attack on the city of Dawfin during the tail-end of the War of the Republican Coalition. The subsequent years of administrative incompetence did not help matters. We will need get things back and up and running again if we wish to restore our naval capabilities to any serious extent."
  dln_worthy:0 "A City Worthy Its Story"
  dln_worthy_desc:0 "Our investment into Dawfin has not gone unnoticed. In recent weeks, thousands of workers and their families from across the Kingdom and beyond have flocked to the city, looking for new opportunities in its newly flourishing naval industry. They shall be welcomed with open arms."
  dln_stroll:0 "A Stroll Through the Streets of Dawfin"
  dln_stroll_desc:0 "I think I have earned a bit of sightseeing..."
  dln_arm_fu:0 "An Army of the Future"
  dln_arm_fu_desc:0 "In the back-when times, Manitoba's banners would induce fear and admiration on the battlefield. Decades of nepotism and corruption at the upper echelons of the Kingdom's military have since tarnished that reputation. But with Langenburgian commanders at the fore, we stand ready to recapture that which was lost."
  dln_roy_air:0 "The Royal Airforce"
  dln_roy_air_desc:0 "For the longest time, the outcome of warfare in the North would be determined by whoever wielded the bigger stick. But times are changing, our enemies growing cunnier and more resilient. Finally introducing a proper standing airforce will give us the leg-up we sorely need."
  dln_exp_arm:0 "Reform the Brass"
  dln_exp_arm_desc:0 "I have lost track of the amount of raw talent passed over for promotion for the sake of appeasing some petty noble in the regions. Moving forward, senior leadership positions will be locked behind rigorous state exams and independent boards. It is the only way to separate the wheat from the chaff."
  dln_rest_knights:0 "Restore the Knights' Glory"
  dln_rest_knights_desc:0 "Under the leadership of Gunn II, the Knights and their institutions had been effectively dismantled, those at the helm viewing its high-ranking officials' undying loyalty to me as a threat to their influence. With the old guard out of the way, the Order can finally thrive once more. Alecander has already proposed a number of reforms to restore the Kingdom's most formidable fighting force to its former glory."
  dln_dec_fleet:0 "A Decentralized Fleet"
  dln_dec_fleet_desc:0 "Towards the close of the War of the Republican Coalition, the bulk of our fleet was taken out in a single, devastating strike on the Royal Port of Dawfin. On that day, it became clear to me that the Kingdom could not afford to station most of its naval assets in one location. Scattering production across the former Duchy will strain operational coordination - but it will also make our supply chain more resilient."
  dln_imperial_city:0 "Rely on the Imperial City"
  dln_imperial_city_desc:0 "The Royal Port of Dawfin has been the source of Manitoba's lake-faring prowess since the Kingdom's inception. The city has taken decades to evolve into a well-oiled machine of naval production, each one of its industrial assets tying back to the wellbeing of the fleet in some way or another. Levelling-up the settlement and its surroundings will only enhance this graceful dance of cylinders and pistons."
  dln_banners_knee:0 "The Banners That Brought Down Manitoba"
  dln_banners_knee_desc:0 "Our latest reforms are already bearing fruit. We only stand to gain by taking things one step further. The more skilled squad leaders will be afforded greater autonomy on the battlefield, letting our best men's ingenuity determine the outcome of battle."
  dln_learned:0 "For All That I Have Learned"
  dln_learned_desc:0 "When a commander falls, the men must stand ready to fulfill his duties at once. They can mourn the loss once the battle is won. So it is written, so it shall be."
  dln_lifetime:0 "A Lifetime of War"
  dln_lifetime_desc:0 "From Battle to Battle, We March in Service of King and Country.\n\nWhere the Crown's Will is Backed by Blood and Iron.\n\nFrom West to East, the Lord's Army Stands Without Equals."
  dln_air_quality:0 "The Quality of the Kingdom"
  dln_air_quality_desc:0 "Manitoban engineers have long been defined by their knack for quality above all else. By allowing them to take their time with the new designs, I am confident their craft will carry over to this new chapter of the Kingdom's military history."
  dln_air_inspiration:0 "With Inspiration From Winnipeg"
  dln_air_inspiration_desc:0 "It appears the Republicans have not been loafing on their behinds over the years. Winnipeg's airfields will provide the foundations to the greatest air force the North has ever witnessed!"
  dln_skies:0 "The Skies Belong to Us!"
  dln_skies_desc:0 "With air production in full swing, it will not take long before our squadrons obscure the very sun itself."
  dln_take_skies:0 "Take to the Skies With Us!"
  dln_take_skies_desc:0 "Birthed from nothing but an idea and can-do spirits, the Royal Air Force has quickly established itself as the dominant power of the Northern skies. Not only have we filled a critical gap in our defenses - we have set out a new legacy for Manitoba's best and brightest to pass on to the generations to come."
  dln_royal_harbour:0 "Expand the Royal Harbours"
  dln_royal_harbour_desc:0 "Our initial efforts to overhaul Dawfin have, among other things, equipped us with the foundations to further expand the boundaries of the Royal Port for a relatively cheap price. I approved the plans on the very day they were put before me - every dockyard we build puts us one step closer to securing our homeland."
  dln_dominance:0 "Dominance at Sea"
  dln_dominance_desc:0 "Wealthy counts and investors from across the Kingdom have taken note of our efforts to overhaul Dawfin, having supplied the Royal Treasury with generous loans to kickstart mass-scale naval production.  Combined with the funds we had already allocated to the programme, this will enable us to expand our lake-faring capabilities to levels never before seen in the history of the Kingdom."
  dln_mare_nostrum:0 "Mare Nostrum"
  dln_mare_nostrum_desc:0 "Dozens of ships undocked from Dawfin and made for the narrow strait into the Winnipegosis in honour of the first Royal Naval Showcase. The exercise was key for identifying any technical faults in the latest batch of ships.  More importantly, it sent a clear message to the Kingdom's rivals that yet resided on the Lake's shores: Manitoba was back and was here to stay."
  dln_eleanor_queen:0 "A New Age for Manitoba"
  dln_eleanor_queen_desc:0 "Father will forever be remembered for bringing our nation back from the brink of collapse. But with the immediate threats to our survival dealt with and the economy humming along once more, it is only right that we make the most of this newfound prosperity to secure a safer and more peaceful future – for both ourselves and the North."
  dln_modernity:0 "The Path to Modernity"
  dln_modernity_desc:0 "I have asked Alecander to assemble the Royal Cabinet. It is best that my intentions be made clear from the outset..."
  dln_the_greatest_matter:0 "The Greatest Matter"
  dln_the_greatest_matter_desc:0 "Some had questions after all. I was more than happy to answer."
  dln_codify:0 "Codify Universial Education"
  dln_codify_desc:0 "Over the years, I have built an extensive network of contacts across the Kingdom’s education scene. No lobbying or under-the-table deals needed here – I will make sure Manitoba sees the dream of free public schooling realised."
  dln_old_estate:0 "The Old Estate"
  dln_old_estate_desc:0 "Some matters have always sat directly with the Crown. I shall see to them personally."
  dln_parlament:0 "A New Parliament?"
  dln_parlament_desc:0 "“...Decentralisation, Your Highness?” inquired the Royal Regions Advisor, sheepishly."
  dln_powers:0 "Powers of the Monarch"
  dln_powers_desc:0 "“But you are beloved by your subjects Your Highness, groomed to rule from birth,” protested the Royal Cabinet Advisor: “Who best to shape the future of our Kingdom but you?”"
  dln_court:0 "Highest Court in the Land"
  dln_court_desc:0 "“What of the Supreme Court Your Highness? Judges from the regions are ineligible for appointment,” noted the Royal Judicial Advisor."
  dln_minority_right:0 "Ratify Minority Rights"
  dln_minority_right_desc:0 "The practice of Royal Assent is destined to falter, be it a year or decade from now. But until that point, it shall serve at least one more noble purpose. That of entrenching the rights of our regional minorities. Whether to protect the cultural wealth of the natives to the North, or the legal rights of the Métis people to the South – I will not stop until all Manitobans are equal before the law. It will cost what it will cost."
  dln_equal:0 "All Equal Beneath the Law"
  dln_equal_desc:0 "Whilst it is too soon to tell what the long-term impact of the latest round of reforms will be, the feedback from the regional governors has been glowing. With just one stroke of the pen, we have taken one giant leap forward in our pursuit of national cohesion."
  dln_constitutionalism:0 "The Road to Constitutionalism"
  dln_constitutionalism_desc:0 "Having addressed all major concerns in the room, only one glaring question mark remained. Eventually, Tobias spoke up: “Your Highness, your efforts to empower your subjects are deeply admirable - but if I may be so daring as to ask:"
  dln_art:0 "Connoisseurs of Art"
  dln_art_desc:0 "In times of conflict and instability, the Crown was regrettably forced to neglect the Kingdom’s thriving art scene. With the immediate threats to the realm put to bed, I have taken it upon myself to redirect a small portion of our military spending towards cultural endeavours across the settlements. It is my sincerest hope that our children will never be to choose the rifle over the paintbrush."
  dln_knight_council:0 "The Knights Council"
  dln_knight_council_desc:0 "For as formidable a fighting force as it is, the Knights’ Order has always lacked a forum to enable regional commanders to share their latest battlefield experiences and insights with one another. That ends today."
  dln_ins_tech:0 "Royal Institute of Technology"
  dln_ins_tech_desc:0 "The reacquisition of the former Duchy of Warwick, combined with the technology salvaged from the MANIFEST facility, has drastically strengthened our capabilities in the fields of robotics and electronics. We shall treasure this knowledge, and ensure it be passed on."
  dln_uni_arch:0 "Winnipeg's University of Architecture"
  dln_uni_arch_desc:0 "As the largest pre-war regional settlement, Winnipeg was also home to some of Manitoba’s most ambitious architecture. What better place to teach future generations how to replicate this grandeur in their hometowns?"
  dln_gentle:0 "A Gentler Manitoba, for a Gentler Future"
  dln_gentle_desc:0 "On that cold winter morning, Father came to me."
  dln_legend_never_ends:0 "The Legend Never Ends"
