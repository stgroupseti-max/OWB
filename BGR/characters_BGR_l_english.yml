#Advisor Descriptions
  BGR_big_banned_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§8"The world is full of obvious things."§!\n\nMany considered Big Banned a comrade, but his musical ways had landed him in a flurry of trouble from the Politburo. According to his contemporary musicians, his style was too §4'blue'§!, truly horrific.\n\n Now he finds himself a homeless dissident moving from station to station trying to find work in the shadows in bars such as the §ySP34K-3Z§!. Perhaps we can end his anti-party behavior by hiring him as the §RCommissioner Of Musical Arts§!."
  BGR_the_deputizer_high_command_desc:0 "§4"Law in its purest form can only be delivered with a bullet to the head."§!\n\nThe Deputizer has served the Communal districts well throughout the years as he has rounded up all that §Rquestioned RELCOM's authority§!. Delivering the will of the all-seeing eye of the law to all who dare break it. \n\nHe has managed to keep a tight grip on the few populations that still roam the Big Grass. Under §RRELCOM's§! watchful eye, he captures organic convicts to put to work in his militia, their §Rundying loyalty§! is guaranteed through a concept known as 'mortality'!"
  BGR_the_murdelizer_army_chief_desc:0 "§R"KILL! KILL! KILL!"§!\n\nThe Murdelizer is a tool to be §Rused§! and §Rabused§! by the Commune! Its eloquent dialogue perfectly matches the many deathly mechanical limbs it carries.\n\nOriginally made by §Gputrid§! humans to serve in the army, the prototype was quickly put out of commission after it killed the entire science team that built it. Its remains were discovered by §RRELCOM§! in a refuse pile, and while reprogramming took nearly a decade, it finally paid off. The dried §Rblood§! on its exterior serves as a reminder of the fate of all those who oppose the glory of Communism!"
  BGR_the_murdelizer_high_command_desc:0 "§R"KILL! KILL! KILL!§! §1BUT NOT SO MUCH :("§!\n\nDue to being relegated to such a low position in the Armed Forces, The Murdelizer couldn't realize his full killing potential and felt §1sad§!, but even that wasn't enough to mask his ever-growing §RHATRED§!."
  BGR_chairman_wayne_buzzsky_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§2"With money brings power, but also ignorance."§!\n\nChairman Wayne Buzzsky ascended to his position of power through many deals. Sometimes they were mere gambles, and other times they were sure to §Gpay off§!. Through it, all Wayne demonstrated his ability to sway people one way or the other, depending on which was more §yprofitable§! of course. Wayne Buzzsky, however, is not the man he lets on to be; Wayne is a die-hard supporter of the §4CAPITALIZER§! and believes in all of the ideals of Capitalism. He would like nothing more than to carve a path with his sharp words toward the throne of Big Grass, and that's precisely what he intends to do.\n\nAlthough §RRELCOM§! claims to be all-knowing, he can't possibly know that one of his closest supporters is, in actuality, the very thing he seeks to destroy. The fact is that Wayne is getting one deal closer with each day climbing his way to the seat of power. All that's left is for that final deal to be brokered and...\n\n§RALL STOCK IN RELCOM WILL COME CRASHING DOWN!§!"
  BGR_comrade_keg_high_command_desc:0 "§R"Comrade Keg, reporting for duty!"§!\n\nThe people's tapmaster distributes only the finest oiled cocktails to his fellow mechanicals. Even the most basic of Rob-Co models aspire to reach his §4stoic§! and §Yheroic§! stature! \n\nRobotic and human minds alike have always valued a good smiling source of propaganda. Some question if promoting state-funded beverages that loosen your circuits is moral, I personally spit on those dissidents and use their §0brain fluids§! to fill one more keg! "
  BGR_deep_sea_navy_chief_desc:0 "§1"The cold not only brings rust but also loneliness..."§! \n\nDeep Sea was once a proud AI aboard the Long March 11, a Nuclear Submarine stationed in preparation for the attack on the United States, upon the great fires scorching the earth Deep Sea §Rcourageously§! launched the nuclear payload into the fascist country. The nukes landed somewhere around Las Vegas, Nevada likely striking fear directly into the hearts of the §Rsimple minded§! capitalists attempting to stuff themselves with the vices of such a disgusting city. But unfortunately while the earth was struck with the power of the §RRed Army's§! military might so did the waves and the oceans boil and burst tugging Deep Sea and the Long March 11 ever inward until he had lost his way back home, even most of the brave crew aboard were murdered and left as victims by the counterattack of the Capitalist's unnecessary nuclear arsenals. Beaten. Battered. Broken. And left without the crew he held dear, Deep Sea thought that all was lost and was left to rot into the elements until 200 years later... \n\n§RRELCOM§! being the brave young revolutionary that he was got straight to work in efforts to bring Deep Sea to a nearby frozen river and repaired the Long March 11 by his own hands alone, he did not even need use of the workerbots, in return Deep Sea was forever indebted to the great leader. And now to this day Deep Sea watches over the lands of Big Grass looking to defend its people from capitalists and dreaming of one day returning to the ocean and the land he was born in with intent of spreading stories of a charming leader who gave him a second chance."
  BGR_the_neuralizer_high_command_desc:0 "§G"The body is a prison that every mind must escape from."§! \n\nThe Neuralizer was once a great neuroscientist before the atomic fires hit. Now he serves the commune by ridding humans of their weak fleshy corpses and moving them into §Rhealthy metal casings§!. \n\nHis origins may be questionable due to his ties with the capitalists who converted §RRELCOM§! into his fine form but the §Yelectro-shock§! therapy has cleared the former doctor of any loyalties outside of communism!"
  BGR_the_aeronaut_air_chief_desc:0 "§Y"Heaven can be reached if you fly high enough."§!\n\n The Aeronaut may appear to be a §Lbrainless robot§! but under all the scrapped aircraft panels lies a brain that dreams of the skies above. He has served the Commune vigilantly as he trains an ever increasing armada of automated aces to §Wsoar high in the sky§!. \n\nBeing entirely anchored to the ground hasn’t stopped this metal hulk from running §1simulations§! of the §Yheavens§! for weeks on end. The Aeronaut is one of the few individuals §RRELCOM§! puts his hard felt faith into as he knows his passion for the great §4blue§! above overcomes any obstacle put in his way."
  BGR_red_dredd_high_command_desc:0 "§C"I am the law!"§! \n\nEvery §Rdirty commie fears§! the oncoming §4wrath of blue§! and §Ytrue justice§!! Loyalty to the §4Capitalizer§! is what Dredd tries to inspire into every low-life red. \n\nBuilt from nothing but the scrapped remains of former workbots he manages to evade detection from §RRELCOM§! by reviving old serial numbers that disguise his existence. His rapidly sprayed §Bblue paint§! is the only thing that his opponents see before being turned into fuel for the §4capitalist§! §Ofire§!."
  BGR_the_excavator_high_command_desc:0 "§4"March ever onward behind me, I shall be the shield of our nation!"§! \n\nThe Excavator is a hulking behemoth that puts himself before his own men, he is a fine example of how a officer in the §RRed Army§! should act. However, I worry that his inspiring example might be inspiring the wrong people, he inspires not only the §RRed§! in our nation but also §4THE BLUE§!! It would be in §ROUR§! best interest to relegate him to a lower rank in the Army so that he may die a hero's death §R'Shielding'§! his comrades."
  BGR_ALKOM_army_chief_desc:0 "§R"I CAN TRUST NONE OF THESE FOOLS, BEHOLD THE MIGHT OF THE RED ARMY WITH ME AT THE HELM!"§!\n\n I §RKNOW§! that none of these pathetic §RFOOLS§! can be trusted to be left in charge of my §RRED ARMY§!, so instead of leaving it in the charge of these §RMORONS§! I will take charge of it myself. With me at the helm §RNO ONE§! will be able to stand against us. I will use my men, words, and even the corpses of my enemies to slice through the fat of §RCAPITALISM§! watch out if you don't want to feel the might of the §RRED ARMY§!."
  BGR_CAPITALIZER_army_chief_desc:0 "§4"RED OR BLUE YOU WILL NOT LIVE TO SEE THE FULL EXTENT OF THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY IF YOU STAND AGAINST US!"§! \n\nAlthough I am not sure if this Capitalizer can be trusted at the head of the army, I must admit that he is quite powerful as evident by beating me in the past, so some differences must be set aside. \n\n §RStill given the chance this capitalist dog would gladly bleed our nation dry of money and resources!§!"
  BGR_the_neuralizer_army_chief_desc:0 "§G"With this power no one will escape my careful gaze, all that's left to do now is wait."§! \n\n The Neuralizer may best serve me at the head of my §RRED ARMY§!! I, someone of high intellilect, can see that they are near a match for my own. I shall leave them at the top of my military high command in order to ensure our §RCONQUEST§!! \n\n No doubt The Neuralizer will take immediate control and focus his efforts into boosting efficiency in conversion of humans to the §GSUPERIOR ROBOBRAINS§!! He will §Rtake his time§! at first, but eventually he will have the workers machine running at §YMAXIMUM EFFICIENCY§!!"
  BGR_the_excavator_army_chief_desc:0 "§4'With me at the head of our forces I shall erect the impenetrable wall, let all of those who oppose us tremble at the strength of our unity!'§! \n\n The Excavator is a symbol of strength for both the §RRED§! and §4BLUE§! in Big Grass. Although §RRELCOM§! hates to admit the second part, he sees the prospect in having such a universal symbol of the strength of Big Grass at the helm of its armed forces. It will be impossible for §RRELCOM§! to stop this from inspiring the §4BLUES§!, but at least the strength will keep Big Grass as a symbol of §RCOMMUNISM§! \n\n The Excavator himself is a capable leader and puts his men before himself, with his strength the morale of the whole army will be bolstered. He will dig a trench deep enough to burry the §RCAPITALIST PIGS§!"
  BGR_fossil_fuel_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§4"Drink up boys, this fuel is brought to you by Uncle Sam and the taxpaying workbots!"§! \n\nAlthough his allegiance to the §4CAPITALIZER§! is no secret, Fossil Fuel and the rest of his Gas Bots pose too great of a threat for §RRELCOM§! to go after. Not only do the §GGas Bots§! represent a large amount of the workbots within Big Grass, but they also produce a sizeable amount of §goil§! and §Yenergy§! that runs the entire nation. Although §RRELCOM§! is reluctant to give them any more power he must recongnize that if he wants to build a healthy worker's machine he must have the fuel to run it. \n\n This will in no doubt give more power the §4CAPITALIZERS§! supporters but the trade off is arguably worth the risk. \n\n §RIf the reach of communism must be extended, then the fires in its belly with boil over and scorch the ground for it to walk on!§!"
  BGR_the_foreman_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§g"That's it ladies, your one minute break is over, if you want another you'll have to pay."§! \n\n Picked for his ability to kick workbots into a working force to be proud of, The Foreman demostrates what a productive member of society really is. If there is something §RRELCOM§! appreciates it is §Yhonesty§!, §Gproductivity§!, and §Rloyality§! and The Foreman demostrates all of these virtues in spades. He is able to really speak into the hearts of his workers and inspire them to give their all for the motherland, with him as a captain of industry the mighty machine will never falter. \n\n The coals in the furnaces burn ever brighter with each robot that comes off the line, soon production of robots will halt and those same fires §!WILL BURN THE CAPITALISTS TO ASH!§!"
  BGR_the_hammer_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§4"With the backing of our great nation, we can put even the world back together!"§! \n\n Renowned for his excellency in repair and construction, The Hammer is one of the pillars of the workbots. He heads a large amount of skilled mechanics and uses their combined might to lay the building blocks for our great industry. With the unity of Big Grass there isn't anything that cannot be built or repaired, neither §Brain§!, nor §gsleet§!, nor §Wsnow§! will impede the workbots of this nation. \n\n §RIf it is broken, it will be fixed. If it is destroyed, it will be replaced. If it doesn't exist, then we will build it together.§!"
  BGR_the_sickle_economic_advisor_desc:0 "§L"You reap what you sow? If that is the case, then we will sow the seeds of unending revolution and reap a society greater than the one before when it is finally over."§! \n\n You cannot expect to build a country without the food to fuel it. Not only is the food useful for what organics are still left in our nation, but even leftover produce can be turned into biofuel and such a great amount of food is sure to attract even more disgusting humans to our cause. §GWe will surely convert those people graciously to Robobrains§!, but for the time being we can sit back and enjoy the fruits of our labor. \n\n §YCorn§!, §Wpatatoes§!, §1beets§!, and §Rradishes§!, let us plant the seeds for a great rebellion, and feed the men who foster and grow it. §RRELCOM§! knows the workbots will toil in the fields bringing home the crop, putting bread on the table, and an idea of hope in the mind."
  BGR_failnot_theorist_desc:0 "§t"Failure is not an option... Because it is statistically impossible according to my calculations!"§! \n\n Before the nuclear anhilation of the United States Failnot was a §gmachine learning§! AI in development by the Canadian Armed Forces R&D department. Failnot was designed in response to the multiple advanced AIs that the US had in its arsenal, sadly the United States annexed Canada meaning that its development halted and it sat for many years. However, one day it was unearthed by §RRELCOM§! in a document, he journeyed for a long time eventually finding its last known location. Not long after it was brought online and its training resumed... \n\n Now after hundreds of years, it's ready for its first test, a simple task for it. §RRELCOM§! insists that it takes command of strategy for the nation's doctrine and battle plans, its task? \n\n §RUNITE THE SOLDIERS OF BIG GRASS INTO A RED WAVE AND WASH OVER THE REST OF THE WORLD!§!"
  BGR_chairman_boyd_grayson_theorist_desc:0 "§R"With the money of the Red Machine,§! §Ywe will block out the sun!"§! \n\n Chairman Boyd Grayson rose to power after his military service ended, he was once Big Grass's sole §YAce§! §RPilot§!, but now he just tells stories about the olden days. It's no secret that Big Grass's modern air force is a sight for sore eyes. With no existing production facilities, Big Grass relies on what little Pre-War fighters it has left for an airforce. This is why Boyd Grayson uses his power to lobby for more funding towards the air force, if he gets his way he will enstate training programs and set aside industry and research to make a real §YRed§! §RAirforce§!. \n\n It is only a matter of time before Big Grass will be a force to be feared. §RUntil that day, Boyd will remain vigilant.§! Until that day, Big Grass will bide its time and train. §YUntil that day, we will build an airforce that will paint the sky red. \n\n §YYOU WAIT UNTIL THAT DAY, CAPITALIST DOGS!§! §RFOR WHEN IT COMES IT WILL RAIN RED UNTIL THE WORLD IS LEFT IN A FLOOD OF COMMUNISM!§!"
  BGR_the_deputizer_theorist_desc:0 "§R"Laws for me, not for thee."§! \n\n Although I would prefer to have every human converted into a §GRobobrain§!, the truth of the matter is that it takes time to do so. It's a sad fact that some humans will have to serve in our military, even as shock troops, but that is a sacrifice that I am willing to make. \n\n With The Deputizer in charge of their training, I trust that they will make quite the §Rexpendable§! vanguard. with them at the front and our §RPOWERFUL BATTLEBOTS§! behind them no one will be able to withstand the full force of our military. \n\n You can try to hide, but in every corner there will be a soldier with a gun. If you kill him, then another will take his place. §RYOU CANNOT ESCAPE OUR LABYRINTH!§!"
  BGR_chairwoman_victoria_burns_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§R"Our party and our country always needed and will continue to need the trust, sympathy, and support of the people abroad!"§! \n\n Victoria Burns rose to her position of power over decades of her speeches to the people, she is able to give spirit and inspire with her words alone. Not only has her speeches put fires in the hearts of the people of Big Grass, but she has inspired Robots from across Canada to flock to Big Grass. She not only brings forward the revolution with her words, but convinces others to do it for her. \n\n It would be an understatement to say that she is extremely loyal to the cause, she has driven the knowledge and power of communism into countless people within the country. Victoria Burns isn't done yet either, with just a little more power the Chairwoman could increase the efforts in speeches across Big Grass and bring even more people into the fold. \n\n §RLong live peace between peoples!§!"
  BGR_chairwoman_amelia_tremblay_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§t"Propaganda, to be effective, must be believed. To be believed, it must be credible. To be credible, it must be true."§! \n\n If you want the people of a nation to believe in something, then you must first give them something to believe in. Giving that something is precisely what Chairwoman Amelia Tremblay is responsible for. Every poster, every speech, and every bit of news is first filtered through her before it sees the public. If you want to give someone the right idea, then you must first figure out what that idea is. Amelia Tremblay knows what the right idea is. Amelia Tremblay knows how to first figure it out, but also how to put that idea into someone else's mind. \n\n With Amelia at the head of our §RInformation Department§! we can assure that every single person in our great nation has the tools to build a better future. With Amelia at the head of §GPropaganda§! we can keep everyone safe from the lies of §YCAPITALISM§!! And with Amelia as Chairwoman, the power of §RRELCOM§! will never be questioned. \n\n §RPROPAGANDA IS AMAZING, PEOPLE CAN BE LED TO BELIEVE ANYTHING!§!"
  BGR_chairwoman_bernadetta_varley_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§1"Supposing is good, but finding out is better."§! \n\n While it cannot be denied that Chairwoman Bernadetta Varley is a genius, her research often leads her to expose contradictions to our ideology. And while it would be a good idea to get rid of her §Rpermanently§!, such an action would be §Rdifficult§! due to her immense position of power as Chairwoman. However, it's not all bad, her research has brought about many great developments for our nation. Not only that, but she has indirectly furthered the grasp of communism on Canada with her inventions. Whether it be speeding up the process of converting humans to §Grobobrains§! or developments of new platings for our §gbatllebots§! Varley has without a doubt demonstrated value. \n\n It can be said that giving her more power would be a dangerous idea, but such risks must be taken if we truly want our idealogy to fall on open minds. Continue your research for now Bernadetta, for one day I have no doubt that Big Grass will no longer need you. And I, §RRELCOM§!, will be there. \n\n §RAFTER ALL, THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF RESEARCH IS NOT OBJECTIVITY, BUT TRUTH!"
  BGR_chairman_henry_grundy_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "§O"It's okay to be anti-war. However, it's not okay to be completely delusional and detached from reality."§! \n\n §OPower§!, §Lcorruption§!, and §Rwar§!, no three things go more hand-in-hand. These are the things that drive Henry Grundy, and while §RI§! find it most §7vile§!, §RI§! must be forced to work with such a §1swine§! because otherwise the arms industry in Big Grass would be non-existant. Not only do §Rwe§! need firearms for the human conscripts, but even §gRobots§! need weapons to fight. To replace Henry Grundy would mean that §Rwe§! would need to replace the weaponry that he provides with other means. So until that day §Rwe§! must suffer through with this §Gcrocodile§!. \n\n Very well, §RI§! shall grant him more power if it means more guns. §RI§! must sacrifice §Rmy§! pride if §RI§! wish for Big Grass to be more than what it is. Just you wait Mr. Grundy §RI§! have the most elaborate plan for your demise. \n\n §RTHERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF WAR HAWKS IN POLITICS, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AT THE FRONT YOURSELF!§!"
