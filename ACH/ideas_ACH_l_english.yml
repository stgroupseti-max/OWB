  ach_defender_trait:0 "Defender"
  ach_defender_trait_desc:0 "The most common rank that is encountered amongst the men and women of the Alamo Chapter. Defenders are the rank-and-file soldiers of the Chapter, although the limited numbers of available recruits have forced many defenders to work in other sectors too."
  ach_protector_trait:0 "Protector"
  ach_protector_trait_desc:0 "The leadership and upper echelon officers of the Alamo Chapter. Usually battle-scarred veterans with plenty of experience. Highly trusted by their men, but few in numbers."
  ach_sentinel_trait:0 "Sentinel"

  ach_elder_trait:0 "Emergency Elder"
  ach_elder_trait_desc:0 "The Alamo Chapter tries to follow Lost Hills' Codex to the T. Yet, the nature of their chaotic creation caused perhaps the Chapter's most important member to break these principles. The Elder of a chapter should only be chosen via council decision, but this council has never met, let alone existed. Kathrine Törni is technically only "Emergency Elder" for this reason, although it's unlikely these semantics really matter. Her reputation alone should keep any dissidents at bay."
