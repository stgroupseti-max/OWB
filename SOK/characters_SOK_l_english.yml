SOK_KAGA_DESC: "How is it that a man can do so much, yet be forgotten in place of another? Achieve so much glory and notoriety across the wasteland, yet none speak his name? Kaga has spent his life living this hell. The exiled Chosen One of Arroyo, Kaga was denied his birthright as the saviour of his people, who instead turned to another, less worthy champion. Many times Kaga sought revenge against them, yet each time they were denied. Now, decades after their last encounter, Kaga plans to return to the home that cast him out, and claim what was lost to him in blood. All will fear and respect his name. He will make sure of it."
