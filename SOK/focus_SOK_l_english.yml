  nf_sok.4.d:0 "Kaga stood over the ash of the battlefield, through the tinted scarlet lens of his APA finally, for the first time in far too long, getting to see the place he was denied for so long. It was Arroyo, the place he was born. The one place that had been ripped from him.\n\nIt was all the Chosen's One fault, he told himself, but Kaga knew there was more to it. Maybe if he had let go of his anger things wouldn't have had to come this far. He looked up at his new, familiar home. He remembered what it used to be like when he was a child, playing under the stars with the other children, wondering what could be out there in the wasteland.\n\nArroyo was in his hands now, and it was up to him whether or not to let go of that anger that took him here this far. Inside of Kaga was a desire to burn this place down, to force himself to let go. To ensure that nobody else could ever take that which was owed to him - of being recognized as "The Chosen One".\n\nHe wanted to destroy this place, to make it disappear. He wanted to forget everything that had happened here. He wanted to erase it all from his memory. Yet another part of him thought that perhaps, given time, he could save this place. Throw his anger away like the ashes in the wind.\n\nThere was a fork in the road, which path would Kaga take?"
