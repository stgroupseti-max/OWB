  TBH_EDWARD_RUSK_NAME: "Edward J. Rusk"
  TBH_EDWARD_RUSK_DESC: "Longstanding Elder of the Texan Brotherhood, Rusk is a formidable opponent for any of Texas' remaining raider scum. Stoic, steady, and always ready with a cigar perched on his lips, he's been clearing a path for the Brotherhood for decades. His greying hair is a sign of his age; he was alive when the Texan Economic Union was formed, being its main proponent on the Brotherhood's side of things. Charismatic and well-liked by the troops for his vices and good company, he can often be found drinking bourbon with the troops. He wears a ten-gallon hat and sports a custom break-action double shotgun, made specifically to use ECPs as ammunition in place of the more traditional slugs. His rather terrifying weapon was manufactured to deal with even the toughest super mutants Texas can offer, and its firepower speaks to that."
