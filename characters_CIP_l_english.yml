  CIP_the_nemonik_character_desc:0 ""§gOnce I was a keeper of memories, yet now I fear I am becoming one myself... No matter, if my time is up soon, then let my last days be that of making new memories for the tribe.§!"\n\nThe effective spiritual and educational leader of the Ciphers, the Nemonik has seen the world change for the worse in recent years. For an aging old man, it only signifies the end of the current era, and the dawn of a new era. But for the Ciphers as a whole, he knows that spiritualism and memorizing ancient schema will only help so much. For the tribe to survive in this rapidly changing new world, it must understand that, contrary to Counter Azkee's propositions of utilizing technology for all its worth, the only way forward that won't result in the tribe losing its place in the world is to retain the status it had when the Prisoner first visited.\n\nBut even as the Nemonik discourages technology, he recognizes the help it provided to many within the Ciphers. Were it not for Trig and her idea of a laser cannon, the Vipers may have turned Mesa Verde into another Dark Mother slave pen. If it weren't for the assistance of the Maxson Bunker Brotherhood, the Ciphers would not have survived the harsh famine that resulted from Denom's 'miracle fertilizer' mishap. And if it weren't for the Prisoner herself... Who knows what state Colorado-or even the rest of the world-would be in.\n\nThe Nemonik is not blind to the benefits technology has provided his people. But he has also seen and heard of what overreliance and outright bans have caused. The Legion of Caesar, the Brotherhood, even their neighbors have all had different approaches to technology. But if Azkee's mathematiks are correct-even as flawed as they have become in recent years-then the maths prove only that the Ciphers don't have much time before a decision must be made. Whether the tribe chooses the wisdom of the Nemonik, or falls to the temptations presented by Azkee, all the Nemonik hopes in the end is that the Ciphers survive..."

  CIP_counter_azkee_character_desc:0 ""§gI have conducted the calculations, and tallied the sums. We must change the variables we find ourselves with in order to survive.§!"\n\nCounter Azkee stands amongst his fellow Ciphers as an intriguing factor. For decades, he has led the tribe alongside the Nemonik, two factors of one equation. For his part, he believes that the Tribe should not be stuck in its ways, returning the same result endlessly, but rather they should utilise their skills and technological understanding to better the Wasteland as a whole. Or indeed, begin to truly understand the math and schema of their ancestors. The Calculations, he argue, can only be solved in the tribes favour by shifting the variables, as the Prisoner herself shifted them years ago. To adapt is to survive, and to assist others is to survive together."
