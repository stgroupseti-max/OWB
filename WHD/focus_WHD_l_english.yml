  whd_baggers_arrive:0 "The Baggers Return"
  whd_baggers_arrive_desc:0 "Years ago, shortly before the robot rampage, a bunch of soldiers and scientists from California squated in the wastes outside Boulder. Now that they've returned, they're causing quite a... stir in the region."
  whd_power_left:0 "Zhang's Defense"
  whd_power_left_desc:0 "Zhang knows that war is coming to the "Powderkeg" in the north, but believes that they should emulate the strategies of the Soviet Union centuries ago and dig in while the Baggers burn themselves out on a two front war, and only attack when victory is absolutely guranteed."
  whd_power_right:0 "Old Dog's Attacks"
  whd_power_right_desc:0 "Old Dog knows that there can be no patience with these soldiers - the longer they have to entrench the more difficult they will be to remove. Better to attack when they aren't ready and crush them from both sides."
  whd_collectivize:0 "Rapid Collectivization"
  whd_collectivize_desc:0 "There isn't much time to waste - we need to pool our resources and start building defenses. Ghouls don't have much, but if all else fails they can get to work stacking scrap or digging trenches."
  whd_chinese_guns:0 ""Chinese" Guns"
  whd_chinese_guns_desc:0 "Before the war, the Chinese infiltrators began stockpiling a large collection of weapons to arm dissidents with. Unable to get shipments from their homeland the stockpile was mostly made of whatever American guns could be scrounged during the chaos and riots."
  whd_crappy_robots:0 "Infiltrator Robots"
  whd_crappy_robots_desc:0 "One part of the infiltrator's original plan involved the distribution of cylindrical robots that could be fired out of their submarine's launch tubes across the countryside. While the delivery system broke down long ago, the fabrication plant still works well enough to turn garbage cans and car parts into a new wave of acceptable canon fodder. Better them than ghouls, at least."
  whd_welders:0 "Always Support Your Local Union"
  whd_welders_desc:0 "The Union are a group of human scavengers and metalworkers that lived in this region before the Ghouls from Dog City arrived. While Old Dog scared them out of their compound, maybe we could convince the stragglers that remain to help us if we promised it back, once the state of emergency was over?"
  whd_exploit_outrage:0 "Exploit Outrage"
  whd_exploit_outrage_desc:0 "A lot of ghouls have a bad history with smoothskins, in one way or another. Stirring up a fervor of these feelings by encouraging them to share their stories of violence, mistreatment, and humiliation should stoke the fires of war in their bellies."
  whd_devil_deal:0 "Make A Devil's Deal"
  whd_devil_deal_desc:0 "Raiders, mercenaries, brutal tribals, call them what you will, the Iron Alliance are assholes we're going to have to deal with at some point. But we won't get the chance if we don't live that long, so Old Dog's ready to propose a deal with the devil of tomorrow to kill the devil of today."
  whd_green_beret:0 "Green Beret Training"
  whd_green_beret_desc:0 "Two centuries later, Old Dog still remembers a few tricks from his time in the Green Berets. Most of the ghouls around him are sorry excuses for soldiers, mostly civilians or wasters that became ghouls later. But with some boot camp and discipline, he'll turn them into proper soldiers yet..."
  whd_blow_em_all_away:0 "Blow Em' All Away"
  whd_blow_em_all_away_desc:0 "Collateral damage this, mutual destruction that, don't blow up civilian targets, blah blah blah. Old Dog's heard it all, but the people who complain about using superior firepower have rarely depended on it to stay alive. There's plenty of old demolitions equpment littering the wasteland, it's time to put it to use demolishing our enemies."
  whd_powderkeg:0 "Preparing for the Powderkeg"
  whd_powderkeg_desc:0 "The clock is ticking on the Powderkeg, and one question still remains. Once the war is over, who is going to be in charge of it all?"
  whd_paratroopers:0 "Deploy the Paratroopers"
  whd_paratroopers_desc:0 "Without a proper airforce the Chinese paratroopers haven't been able to train for airdrops for a few centuries, but that doesn't mean they've slacked off on the rest of their training. It's time to deploy them to the field, on foot if they must."
  whd_deep_infiltrators:0 "Deep Infiltration Tactics"
  whd_deep_infiltrators_desc:0 "Before the war, nobody knew quite how many infiltrators were in Colorado except for perhaps Zhang himself. Even now there are still old loyalists embedded in the lands claimed by the Baggers and Luminous ones, all ready to report movements and perform sabotage as needed."
  whd_defend_the_people:0 "Defense Of The People"
  whd_defend_the_people_desc:0 "In any war morale is key, and it is important to remember why we are fighting at all. Everything we do must be for the sake of the people. Even if it detracts from the war effort, we must have plans to ensure that every noncombatant is safe and secure, and that they have an escape plan if we should fail."
  whd_fortify:0 "Fortify The Border"
  whd_fortify_desc:0 "One of the only things Zhang and Old Dog can agree on is the need to build fortifications on the border with the Baggers. While there might not be enough material to build bunkers on the entire border, so we'll have to fortify the key points and pursue a flexible defense."
  whd_infrastructure:0 "Build Up Infrastructure"
  whd_infrastructure_desc:0 "Logistics are the key to winning any war, and by tasking the welders to assemble a light rail, we should be able to run at least hand carts and basic wagons from our reserves to the front."
  whd_trucks:0 "Supply Trucks"
  whd_trucks_desc:0 ""When it comes to getting food to our ghouls in the field, nothing will be quite as flexible as a good General Motors transport truck. And I ain't getting on no commie train.""
  whd_economic_mobilization:0 "Economic Mobilization"
  whd_economic_mobilization_desc:0 "Even in the barren wastes of northern Colorado, the ghouls of Dog City have found the time and resources to build up something of a civilian economy. But even these tenacious ventures must be put aside for a war economy to ensure our survival."
  whd_extra_ghouls:0 "Call On Outside Ghouls"
  whd_extra_ghouls_desc:0 "At the end of the day, every ghoul here is fighting for their freedom. Old Dog has made abundantly clear that the promises of the NCR are lies, that the only way to avoid becoming second class citizens to a bloated bureacracy of rich smoothskins is for every able bodied ghoul, and even those missing a limb or two to take up arms and fight for Colorado."
  whd_ghoul_supremacy:0 "Ghoul Supremacy"
  whd_ghoul_supremacy_desc:0 "Old Dog doesn't doubt that humans and smoothskins can live together, but knows that perfect harmony isn't exactly easy between the two and any system made by "normal" humans will always benefit them in the end. The simple fact is we want, no need, to build a nation of ghouls, for ghouls, and only once we've secured our own freedom can we consider smoothskin's place in it."
  whd_prepare_for_war:0 "The War Approaches"
  whd_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "It's only a matter of time before the Powderkeg ignites, it's time to put our plans into action and brace for the explosion."
  whd_emergency_soldiers:0 "Emergency Soldiers"
  whd_emergency_soldiers_desc:0 "We can't afford to let a single ghoul shrug their duties! Time to put every man, woman, and feral into the field at once!"
  whd_old_robots:0 "Old Robots"
  whd_old_robots_desc:0 "A few of our citizens still know a thing or two about robots, and while most of them have wandered north into the plaguelands or been scrapped for salvage, there's always just a few more hidden in old world ruins. Let's put them on the front as our shields of steel!"
  whd_heavy_mercs:0 "Armored Mercenaries"
  whd_heavy_mercs_desc:0 "A group of mercs from the East, mere boys who haven't earned the right to true power armor yet, have offered their services at a very favorable rate. We need every man we can now, let's make the deal!"
  whd_press_welders:0 "Press Gang The Welders"
  whd_press_welders_desc:0 "There's still a few bands of Union men that aren't certain of our cause. Time to make it clear that we aren't asking for their help any more - it's join or die!"
  whd_victory:0 "Victory At Last"
  whd_victory_desc:0 "Against the odds we've manage to take out both the Baggers and the Luminous Ones. But without a common enemy, Old Dog and Zhang know it's time to settle who's in charge once and for all..."
  whd_zhang_wins:0 "Captain Zhang's Revolutionary Victory!"
  whd_zhang_wins_desc:0 "The carrion of the Old Dog clique wrapped themselves in false revolution, plotting to revise the line and restore exploitation. But Captain Zhang rose in the people’s hour, red banner aloft, and shattered their schemes with proletarian steel. Let none be deceived — counter-revolution still nests in loyal faces. Yet beneath the shining light of Zhang Thought, Dog City marches toward true socialism!"
  whd_red_army:0 "A New Red Army"
  whd_red_army_desc:0 "The Powderkeg was a trial for the ghouls of Colorado, but now that the war is over it's time to formalize our forces. Chinese spies, Union volunteers, American Ghouls, and Mercenaries were fine enough in an emergency, but now it's time to bring it all together into a cohesive force to defend the People of Colorado!"
  whd_weapon_schematics:0 "Chinese Weapon Schematics"
  whd_weapon_schematics_desc:0 "The Shanghai's central computer contains a number of schematics for advanced Chinese weapons, but the manufacturing centers needed to actually make them were destroyed long ago. With the Houndlands secured and a little help from the Union it's time to repair these facilities and put high quality wepaons into our soldiers' hands!"
  whd_crimson_dragoons:0 "Crimson Dragoons"
  whd_crimson_dragoons_desc:0 "During the Great War China wagered that Stealth technology would be the game changer that could even the odds against the United States larger army. While it wasn't enough to win the war, the He Gui Stealth Suits were enough to slip behind and cause chaos in the battle lines of a real superpower. Some suits still lie waiting on the Shanghai, and it's time to outfit our own ghost divisions."
  whd_red_army_armor:0 "Our Own Power Armor"
  whd_red_army_armor_desc:0 "The "Red Shift" Power Armor project was a moderate success in producing schematics for a fully Chinese Power Armored suit, and copies were disseminated to Infiltrators in the hopes that they could be rapidly assembled and used to entrench uprisings. The suits may not be as advanced as American designs, but with a few changes they should be more than capable of protecting our elite forces in the field."
  whd_dragoon_tactics:0 "Dragoon Tactics"
  whd_dragoon_tactics_desc:0 "Ancient Dragoons were soldiers who were capable of fighting just as well in Power Armor as they were without it. Combining our latest innovations together we have the potential to revitalize this concept in a truly frightening way - power armored soldiers that can shed their armor and disappear the moment the enemy seems ready to adapt. Our enemies will literally never know what hit them."
  whd_war_machines:0 "War Machines"
  whd_war_machines_desc:0 "Human lives are rare and precious things in the wasteland, and good ghoul soldiers are even harder to replace. But what if we didn't have to put any of our ghouls in harm's way? Perhaps by combining the robotics technology of our infiltrators with some American prototypes, we could make our armors fight on their own. They might be limited by programming, but a suit is easier to replace than a comrade."
  whd_alpha_strike:0 "Alpha Strike"
  whd_alpha_strike_desc:0 ""He who strikes first wins", a principle any soldier knows. It is not enough to have an Air Force for defense, we must also prepare our pilots to be ready at a moment's notice, and expand the bays of our bombers to hold even more destructive payloads. Only the finest planes will do; If we cripple our foes capabilities in the opening hours of a war, our victory is already assured."
  whd_red_air_force:0 "Advanced Air Force"
  whd_red_air_force_desc:0 "Air supremacy is the key to any war between developed powers, and while we lack much competition in Colorado the Baggers prove that there are already empires forming in the wasteland. We must be ready with our own air force so we are not caught unprepared when we finally meet."
  whd_china:0 "Colorado, With Chinese Characteristics"
  whd_china_desc:0 "It has long been clear to Zhang that Zhongguo, China in the tongue he's grown used to, is a place he'll likely never see again. But what of its culture? The beached Shanghai has within its computer copies of many classic texts of Chinese culture, along with more modern additions that were approved by the party. Maybe by disseminating them and encouraging traditional morals, China's spirit will live on?"
  whd_four_books_five_classics:0 "Four Books, Five Classics"
  whd_four_books_five_classics_desc:0 "Fundamental texts of Confucianism, albeit slightly revised to comply with modern ideology. While not all of the lessons will take hold quickly, these books may be essential to creating the "wholistic" worldview that was so lacking in many Americans before and after the war. It might take a few more edits to make them palatable to wastelanders, but all cultures must evolve."
  whd_dao_de_jing:0 "Dao De Jing"
  whd_dao_de_jing_desc:0 "Zhang was never a very spiritual man, but he always found some concept in "Dao". The entire universe is energy, bursting with potential, always flowing and changing. You can strive against it or go with it. Understand it. Embrace it. If the people learn that everything in the universe has a purpose, perhaps they will be more prepared to find their own purpose within it?"
  whd_art_of_war:0 "The Art Of War"
  whd_art_of_war_desc:0 "Truth be told the Art Of War is not a very advanced text. It was made to teach sheltered nobles the most basic of strategic thinking, things that would be elementary to any experienced commander but grand revelations to the sheltered and ignorant. But given the education recieved by the average wastelander... it would be good to give to our soldiers, so long as they can read it."
  whd_little_red_book:0 "Little Red Book, Second Edition"
  whd_little_red_book_desc:0 "The Original was declared a "Modern Classic" by the party, but much of it is built on assumptions 3 centuries old. Perhaps a few rewrites here and there for the second edition and a new section to accomodate Zhangism will create a more... modernized book for the masses."
  whd_refined_society:0 "A Refined Society"
  whd_refined_society_desc:0 "It has taken many months to print and distribute enough books to saturate the nation, but by now the talking points are spreading like wildfire. Already a subtle shift is taking place, the Houndlands becomming more... patient. Refined. Dignified. Finallly, it is a fertile soil for a true communist culture to germinate from."
  whd_zhang_speech:0 "A Rousing Speech For Zhangism!"
  whd_zhang_speech_desc:0 "Captain Zhang was always a true believer in socialism. While his country had its failings, so did every other nation before the Great War. But any Ghoul who lives long enough comes to see that you get out of this world what you put into it, and every short-sighted, greedy decision you make will come back to burn you in the end. You cannot poison the soil of tomorrow and expect crops to grow. It is time for Ghouls to become Vanguards of the Revolution as only they could!"
  whd_forgive_baggers:0 "Forgiving The Baggers"
  whd_forgive_baggers_desc:0 "The Baggers were imperialists for a capitalist state following in every corrupt footstep of the United States, but what alternatives were they presented with? Some of them, from a place called "Shi" to the west at least have enough imagination to envision a world driven by science, not profit. It is time to open our arms to those willing to support our cause."
  whd_integrate_union_welders:0 "Restoring The Union"
  whd_integrate_union_welders_desc:0 "When Old Dog arrived from Denver, he and his men displaced The Union from their compound, scattering them to the wind. Although they are not ghouls they fought alongside us, and they are great experts in metalworking and salvage. It is time to honor our debt to them by restoring them to their compound so they can gather and pool their knowledge again, this time as our allies."
  whd_central_planning:0 "Central Planning"
  whd_central_planning_desc:0 "Scattered across the Houndlands we will never get anything done. It is time to declare a capital, so we can better coordinate our reconstruction efforts across the entire region without having to hunt down every little village."
  whd_glowing_ones:0 "The Glowing Ones"
  whd_glowing_ones_desc:0 "The "Luminous Ones" are a dangerous cult, spreading ideas of the divinity of radiation, and the ascencion of all ghoulkind. While a nation of immortals may sound enticing, the costs are too high for Zhang to permit them to continue spreading their faith. It is time to take in these cultists and channel their devotion away from superstition, so they can use their intuitive understanding of radiation to better the world, not poison it."
  whd_human_tolerance:0 "Human Tolerance"
  whd_human_tolerance_desc:0 "Old Dog did quite a lot of damage to Ghoul-Non-Ghoul relations in the Houndlands, but it is important to reassure the people that all have a place in the Utopian future."
  whd_red_mountain_red_army:0 "The Red Mountain"
  whd_red_mountain_red_army_desc:0 "The Red Mountain of the Great Glowing One is... grand and intoxicating. It was a struggle to claim it, through fire and war, and as they helped us drive out the Mongrel Dogs of the NCR, it is not too late for our mercy. Here, in this place where destiny is made, we might once again be friends - comrades, brothers in arms."
  whd_rebuilding_the_wastes:0 "Rebuilding The Houndlands"
  whd_rebuilding_the_wastes_desc:0 "The Houndlands are a land that was devastated even before the bombs, wracked by plague and mass migrations. Little of value remains here, but by making sure to optimize every resource and assign every ghoul a job, we could make it livable."
  whd_unions:0 "Establish More Unions"
  whd_unions_desc:0 "The existing "Union" was founded by metalworkers and scavs who thought it would describe their unity. While this is true, it is also important to re-instate more conventional unions so that workers of every field can make their cause heard. It is important to trust the experts who do their work, and keep their coordinators from getting too arrogant and complacent. Wouldn't want any traitors of the revolution, after all."
  whd_vault_secrets:0 "Secrets Of The Hidden Vault"
  whd_vault_secrets_desc:0 "The Shanghai wasn't the only place the Infiltrators called home before the war. In the north of Colorado a Vault that was almost finished construction was left abandoned when the outbreak depopulated the area. It became a center of operations for spies and sympathizers alike, a place to stock our weapons and house captives we rescued from the Insta-pens. While the lack of a door meant it couldn't save the occupants from ghoulification, the vault remains a valued refuge from the dangers of the waste above."
  whd_collective_agriculture:0 "Social Agriculture"
  whd_collective_agriculture_desc:0 "Historically, collectivizing Agriculture has been met with fierce resistance by existing farmers and resulted in quite a bit of difficulty. But this is a golden opportunity to experiment with cooperative farming: There's barely any farming in the houndlands to begin with! From community gardens to hydroponic factories, soon the Houndlands will be the breadbasket of Colorado."
  whd_greater_leap_forward:0 "A Greater Leap Forward"
  whd_greater_leap_forward_desc:0 "Backyard Industry was, to the shame of China, a failure of the Great Leap Forward. But China was trying to build concrete and steel mills using the technology of the 60s, but the ingenuity and technology of the wasteland might just make it work this time..."
  whd_fully_automated:0 "Fully Automated"
  whd_fully_automated_desc:0 "Simple automation is essential for achieving true socialism, as no society that requires drudgery to survive can ever truly know freedom from want. We must analyse every task, find every inefficiency, and refine our methods until our machines are practically making themselves. Only then can we truly rest."
  whd_iron_comrades:0 "Iron Comrades"
  whd_iron_comrades_desc:0 "Robots! Glorious Robots. They work without tire, toil without question, and serve with nothing but loyalty to their supervisors. But it is essential to always remember their importance to our society, and respect the work our iron comrades do for us, especially as we expand their ranks."
  whd_next_step:0 "Taking The Next Step"
  whd_next_step_desc:0 "We've done the best we can with the Houndlands, but the truth is that it is simply too poor in resources and technology to jumpstart the revolution. But to the west lies a facility designed to survive even the apocalypse, a fully automated research facility containing some of the most advanced technology ever developed by the pre-war United States. No matter who lays claim to it now, we need to take it for ourselves if we want to build a true Utopia in Colorado."
  whd_computer:0 "Resetting The ZAX"
  whd_computer_desc:0 "The information stored on the Boulder ZAX could no doubt help us, it's simply too far decayed for our scientists to decipher, and we are too late to possibly save its intelligence. Our only option is to force it to output a print of all of its data and reformat the entire machine. It could take centuries to decipher all the code it outputs by hand, but if there's one thing ghouls have - its time. What was discovered once can be discovered again, we need the ZAX more than whatever it knows."
  whd_study_construction:0 "Study The Dome's Architecture"
  whd_study_construction_desc:0 "Boulder Dome was designed to be a self-sustaining city of the future, resistant to nuclear weapons, plagues, and even serving as a prototype for colonies in space. A clever man would seek the treasures inside the Dome, but a Wise man knows the dome itself has just as much to teach us."
  whd_medicine:0 "Universal Healthcare"
  whd_medicine_desc:0 "Boulder Dome contains enough medical supplies and resources to keep our population healty for decades, and has the facilities to manufacture even more. While we will need to replicate these facilities later, for now we can afford to give univeral Healthcare to every citizen of the Houndlands and Boulder. Like a CIVILIZED country."
  whd_study_automation:0 "Analyzing The Arcology"
  whd_study_automation_desc:0 "As much as the dome has to teach us, its self sufficiency is also an essential mystery to attaining true freedom from want or need. Who knows what new robots or manufacturing routines were hidden inside the Dome?"
  whd_our_rock:0 "Centerplace Of The Revolution"
  whd_our_rock_desc:0 "We're still discovering new rooms and chambers as we analyze Boulder Dome, but over these last few months our presence has become second nature to the ghouls of Boulder.

  whd_eastern_mercenaries_desc:0 "Greedy capitalists, morally bankrupt killers, and willing to sell out to the most heinous of imperialist tyrants, the "Iron Alliance" to the east will never be able to coexist with the ghouls of the Houndlands for long. But the longer we wait, the larger their armies grow. It is time to take decisive action to secure our eastern flank!"
  whd_two_sterlings:0 "Two Sterlings"
  whd_two_sterlings_desc:0 "In the wake of the war, many of the survivors of Sterling fled east, where they founded "New Sterling". The city has grown to be quite an economic hub, and while we should focus on self-sufficiency, having at least one city where outsiders can come to trade vital resources could prove helpful to rebuilding the Houndlands."
  whd_river_control:0 "Controlling The River"
  whd_river_control_desc:0 "For centuries the Shanghai has sat beached on the banks of the Platte River, gathering rust and leaving its sailors forced into roles they were never truly trained for. The Iron Alliance on one end and Plaguelands on the other made travelling further down river impossible, but as our shore in the Houndlands expand it is time to build new vessels for our venerable sailors."
  whd_xian_fighters:0 "Our Immortal Fighters"
  whd_xian_fighters_desc:0 "One of greatest secrets ever developed in the great war was the Xian-85 Stealth Fighter, a supersonic fighter that could fly higher and faster than any American equivalent, and yet still disappear from the sky at the push of a button. The Shanghai was too small to store more than one of these magnificent fighters, but by studying the schematics relentlessly and working with the Union to develop replacement materials, we might be able to put a few into the sky again."
  whd_armor_study:0 "Studying Their Armor"
  whd_armor_study_desc:0 "There can be little doubt that over their decades of fighting in the wasteland, the Iron Alliance developed many clever modifications to turn their otherwise sub-par power armor into a force to be reckoned with.

What can the Hangdogs teach us about befriending their hounds, the Brotherhood about building new bunkers, Comrade Doki about the finer points of robot consciousness, and even the Scorpions gang know a thing or two about poisons that we could learn. Only by involving everyone in the revolution can we build a lasting society in Colorado."

It imprisoned more than a few in its insta-pens along with plenty of innocents that would turn to our cause. But our experience with the ZAX in Boulder Dome reveals that the WARDEN the Hangdogs woke up recently was not the original we had fought, but another AI entirely!
