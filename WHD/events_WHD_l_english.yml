  nf_whd.1.d:0 "Centuries ago, before the bombs fell, Old Dog was already a grizzled soldier, having seen enough of war. From fighting for the last oil fields of the Middle East to trying to keep the peace in Europe as NATO collapsed to fighting in the jungles of southern China, he fought for his country, until one fine day in 2075 when they told him his time was up. "Too old to keep fighting, time to retire", they said. "Go get a nice little house in the suburbs, maybe a hobby" they said. Bah. He always figured he wouldn't know what to do with himself when the time came, but for 2 years he tried to make his little house in colorado a home, to find something to do with his time.\n\nAnd then the bombs dropped.\n\nFor a time, Old Dog felt back in his element. The chaos central Denver couldn't quite reach his house at the edge of the city, but he did his damndest to keep the order among the survivors. In time he noticed he wasn't getting nearly as old or weak as the Army though, in fact he'd never felt better! His looks left something to be desired though, as ghoulification stole what was left of his once rugged face. But Old Dog didn't care, he kept on fighting and built himself a nice little unit, a village even on the edge of Dog City. The Ghouls were only one of the factions scavenging claims in the city, and people weren't always kind about their appearance, but they got on well enough. It was a messy life, but Old Dog kind of liked that, and for a while he was happy.\n\n And then the Hangdogs showed up."
  nf_whd.1.a:0 ""I had to leave the war, but the war couldn't leave me!""
  nf_whd.2.t:0 "The Hangdogs"
  nf_whd.2.d:0 "When the Hangdogs showed up, Dog City was a mostly peaceful place, where violence between scavs was limited by the Claim System. The Hangdogs clearly didn't want to, but played along biding their time until the perfect moment came, their chance to claim it all. Almost 20 years ago a giant robot looking for some lost "prisoner" came through the place, tearing a path of destruction through Dog City and throwing the entire system into chaos. "Snarls Like Thunder", the chief of the Hangdogs at the time was killed by the robot's rampage, putting his incompetent coward of a son in charge. But the boy lacked his father's restraint, and let loose the Hangdogs and their dogs in the chaos, pushing out every other tribe trying to stake their claim in the city - Including the ghouls. Despite his best efforts, Old Dog couldn't hold them off forever, and eventually he was forced to flee north with the rest of Denver's ghouls."
  nf_whd.2.a:0 ""Filthy bastards stole most of what we had, but not our fight.""
  nf_whd.2000.t:0 "Pushed Out Of Dog City"
  nf_whd.2000.d:0 "The lands north of Denver were never very prosperous. The New Plague outbreak in Denver before the war caused a massive flight from the region, and the massive outbreak in Nebraska saw the entire state cut off from the world. But when Old Dog and the Denver Ghouls arrived, they found it was not as empty as the wasteland believed.\n\nDuring the Great War, Denver had become a hub of civil unrest and saw many of its Chinese American citizens imprisoned by the monolithic WARDEN program, trapped in insta-pens to prevent any "subversive activities". But under the WARDEN's watchful eyes, Captain Zhang and his submarine crew were able to operate, stirring up further unrest and recruiting more and more prisoners to their side. When the bombs came from their own country, they took cover in an unfinished vault, surviving as immortal ghouls. By the time the refugees from Denver arrived, the Chinese ghouls had already built a sizable town around the old vault.\nUnderstanding their shared plight as ghouls, Zhang allowed the Dog City ghouls to stay, and they soon became the majority in the region. Many of them still consider Old Dog their de-facto leader, but each day more ghouls are swayed by Zhang's passionate speeches and promises of a Communist Utopia."
  nf_whd.2000.a:0 ""They're lucky we need the manpower for now""
  nf_whd.2000.b:0 ""Ghouls of Colorado, your future is in your own hands!""
  nf_whd.3.t:0 ""And then there's these assholes""
  nf_whd.3.d:0 "And then the Baggers-\n\n"Jesus Fucking Christ, can't you people just leave me alone?"\nOld Dog had had enough of this shit. It had barely been a few months since the NCR expedition, or "Baggers" as people had come to call them started pouring into the region. The Ghoul Lands had seen their fair share of refugees so far, but this was different. These were Smoothskins, soldiers and scientists waltzing in like they owned the place. Keeping the locals at arms length, renaming the local towns after their president, setting up a fort... any claims this was a "temporary expedition" was bullshit. Old Dog knew their game, he'd been in their shoes enough to know these were colonists, and the moment their home country showed up they'd sell Colorado to them on a silver platter.\n\nAnd he wasn't having any of it."
  nf_whd.3.a:0 ""I know a few good ghouls to count on when this goes hot...""
  nf_whd.4.t:0 "Question Of Command"
  nf_whd.4.d:0 "The fuse is quickly burning out on the Powderkeg, and with war on the horizon an important question has consumed the Withered Dogs: Strategic plans aside, who should have ultimate command over their forces? Old Dog has much more experience with aggressive attack, having dislodged insurgents in the European collapse and cleared out trenches in the Philipenes. Zhang, on the other hand has been trained and practiced at fortifying nearly any location, and using stealth and subterfuge to prevent the advance of enemy forces. With both constantly butting heads, one must be chosen to hold command over the other, at least temporarily."
  nf_whd.4.a:0 "Old Dog's plan of attack will push out the Baggers!"
  nf_whd.4.b:0 "Zhang is right, we can't take needless risks."
  nf_whd.5.t:0 "Ready For War"
  nf_whd.5.d:0 "The Powderkeg is burning down to its limits, and there's little else that can be done to prepare. Old Dog, Zhang, and all the other Withered Dogs of the Houndlands can do nothing but wait now. Let's hope it was enough to survive."
  nf_whd.5.a:0 ""Dig In and Get Ready men!""
  nf_whd.6.t:0 "Ghouls Victorious!"
  nf_whd.6.d:0 "Against the superior resources of the Baggers and the zealous crusaders of the Luminous ones, it was the common Ghouls of the Houndlands, the so called "Withered Dogs" that managed to survive and outlast. It was a close call, but peace has been restored to the region - for now. But one issue remains unreslolved.\n\nOld Dog always knew Zhang would be a problem, and in the wake of the Baggers defeat it was finally time to settle who was in charge.\n"It's simple, isn't it? Your country, your traditions. An election, direct and absolute. We'll let the will of the people decide who will lead them".\n"Yeah... something like that. I know they'll make the right choice. Not much point electing someone who will take away your vote after all!"\nThe two Ghouls shook hands, even as they stared daggers at each other.\n\nWhen the tallying was done, and every Ghoul in the Houndlands had cast their vote, the results were undeniable..."
  nf_whd.6.a:0 "Old Dog! A win for Real Democracy!"
  nf_whd.6.b:0 "Captain Zhang! To a new Socialist Future!"
  nf_whd.7.t:0 "Are Ghouls Not The Ideal Vanguards?"
  nf_whd.7.d:0 ""Ghouls of the Houndlands, have you ever wondered why bad things happen? Why did the world end? Why do ghouls go feral? Why must war still rage? Why does Poverty exist?\n\tWell I have come to tell you that there is a simple answer to all of these things; Shortsightedness. Men only live long enough to care about what happens tomorrow, next week, maybe a few years down the line. But decades, centuries, or generations later? The common man does not care, he never has. The consequences of his actions, of his self-centered greed, are often too far away for him to see, to ever care about. He could despoil the planet's resources, swindle his neighbors with nonsense money, and vote for a war that would condemn his children's world, all without care or worry. And this shortsightedness led man to destroy the world.\n\tBut we Ghouls, we know better don't we? We may have been common men once, but now we must live with the consequences of our actions. We live each day in the horrible world built on our own decisions. How many of you have scorned or scammed another ghoul, only for them to return the favor decades later? How many have chosen "a lot today but none tomorrow", only to find yourself hungry when tomorrow never ends? How many still dream of the world before the bombs?\n\tWith this in mind I must ask you, who among you is ready to change their ways? You may have heard nasty things about Socialism, but I believe anyone who lives long enough will come to see its virtues. It is time for us to sacrifice today for a better tomorrow. To let go of selfishness and lift up our neighbors to a better world. To build a Utopia not just for future generations, but one that we ourselves might live to see. I cannot promise an easy journey, but if you can let go of ego and find your place in the greater good, I can promise you it will be worth it.""
  nf_whd.7.a:0 ""Three Cheers for Zhang! Father of a new Revolution!""
  nf_whd.8.t:0 "Forgiving The Baggers"
  nf_whd.8.d:0 "In the months following the Powderkeg, Zhang made sure to keep an eye on the defeated, especially the ones ghouls called "Baggers". These smoothskins came here for a reason, an expedition by a well organized military, and he would be a fool not to learn everything possible about their mission. In time, through spies, careful monitoring, and the simple weapon of kindness, he was able to get close enough to discover a few important details.\n\nThe Baggers came from a republic out to the west known as the "New Califronia Republic". This state was much larger and more organized than any other they had found in the wasteland, and its interest in Colorado was the same thing Zhang had been sent to study centuries ago - Boulder Dome. While Zhang made it abundantly clear that he could not allow them to bring its secrets back to the NCR, if they were truly committed to bringing its secrets to all mankind, their chances of getting in would be better together..."
  nf_whd.8.a:0 ""Only together can we restore humanity to greatness!""
  nf_whd.9.t:0 "Restoring Union Rule"
  nf_whd.9.d:0 "The Union were some of the earliest settlers in the lands west of Sterling, having settled down and set up a massive compound for their metalworking. Before the Ghouls pushed them out, these men and women used to work together as an autonomous collective - anarchists. This, Zhang knows, is also a form of socialism, but one that struggles to scale. Truthfully it was their limited scope that left them so vulnerable to displacement. But a deal is a deal, and so their compound and autonomy will be restored to them, so long as they do not interfere with the revolution. Maybe watching them and studying how well they can continue to work could provide insight into community management in the future?"
  nf_whd.9.a:0 "At the very least, they'll be good neighbors."
  nf_whd.10.t:0 "Deprograming The Glowing Ones"
  nf_whd.10.d:0 "The Great Glowing One is... a concern, for Zhang. The Luminous Ones may have been defeated on the battlefield, but many Ghouls still believe in the dreams of a radioactive world of "Ghoul Supremacy". The Great Glowing One has been imprisoned, but his influence remains. While Religion was considered of lesser importance in the homeland, America has always been a very... spiritual nation.\n\nPerhaps it would take time to convert these ghouls from their old ways, but time was a thing they had in abundance. In the meantime, a gentle nudge might be all it took to get them on the right path. It was no longer enough to consider how "great" Ghouls were compared to humans. No. Now it would be time for them to prove it, by working, studying, and leading by example. Surely even the Glowing One himself would tell them to be proud in their contributions to Ghoul-Kind?"
  nf_whd.10.a:0 "Someday, they will find zeal for humanity as well."
  nf_whd.11.t:0 "Dreaming of Denver"
  nf_whd.11.d:0 "It was his little piece of America, Old Dog thought. \n\nSure, it didn't match the beauty of its fruited plains, but it was his 40 acres, sans the mule. It was one of the oldest American dreams to be a Yeoman with a homestead. It wasn't the dream Old Dog had fought for, but it was the dream that landed in his lap. \n\nThe Hangdogs, they came and took it all away. They blew up his house the way the Reds blew up America. Old Dog fought tooth and bloody nail for this sweet land of liberty. He bled on the flag to keep those stripes flying right. He would have fought all the way into the heart of China if they hadn't made him retire. \n\nAnd so, with his old buddies by his side, he'll fight. He'll fight for an old dream made new, and he'll imagine he's butchering those Commie bastards when he puts the Hangdogs down."
  nf_whd.11.a:0 "If you love something, why let it go?"
  nf_whd.12.t:0 "Our Mission Accomplished"
  nf_whd.12.d:0 "A stage had been set in central Denver this fine day. Gathered before it were the various motley dregs that made up Denver's citizenry, and to it ascended the good Colonel Zhang. \n\n"Good people of this fair city, this is the dawn of a new day for you!" He announced, beginning his speech. "Many of you may fear my arrival, but I assure you such apprehension would be misplaced. I herald a better future for you all. For so long, you have no doubt suffered. Squalor, poverty, unending conflict. This city, long a pile of scrap and salvage, can be transformed. Through the power of cooperation and collective action, a Red Sun will shine over Dog City, Denver! Some of you may know 'Socialism' as a boogeyman's word. Some of you may not even know what Socialism means. But I assure you, when we are done working together, you will know and appreciate it. Please, join us in bringing a better future to Denver, Colorado, and perhaps the entire world! One and all, for the common good!" \n\nApplause and cheers broke out. Perhaps not as much as Zhang had hoped, but their work had yet to begin."
  nf_whd.12.a:0 "They'll thank us in time."
  nf_whd.13.t:0 "Eternal Victory Of The Proletariat"
  nf_whd.13.d:0 "Once again, Colonel Zhang took up his position in Denver. Today, however, he was not atop a wooden, ramshackle stage. He stood atop a well crafted, raised plinth. It was a microcosm for the entire city. Wherever you looked, things had changed. Trash had been collected, scrap beaten into local amenities, and the streets were safe to walk down. It was still a ruin in many ways, but it was a changing ruin. \n\n"My people, I ask only that you look upon our work here with your own eyes. The proof of what Socialism is capable of is set in the metal and stonework of your very city. But it isn't just here that fortunes have changed. All across Colorado, we have built railways, industries, even gardens. We have, upon our own backs, built a home for ourselves. \n\nBut does this herald the end of our toil, of our struggle? No, this is only the beginning of our great effort. Our work in Colorado is not finished, but beyond our garden lies a world of struggling proletariats, yearning to breathe free. We will never be safe until we pry the corrupt talons of the elite from the hearts of our comrades! \n\nFor now, rest and understand we have made many steps on our journey of a thousand miles. But someday, I will march forward to liberate this Wasteland! When I do, I ask only that you join me, for the sake of your fellow man!" With a raised fist, Denver erupted with noise. Once again a stark difference from when he first stood here. He had made sure it would be the case."
  nf_whd.13.a:0 "Even if it takes ten thousand years, we will continue the revolution!"
  nf_whd.14.t:0 "The Fate of Dog City"
  nf_whd.14.d:0 "Old Dog was never truly comfortable in his ramshackle house in "Dog City" after the war, but at least it was his. Ever since the Ghouls had been kicked out by the Hangdogs he had been left in squalor, scheming for the perfect opportunity to return and right this injustice - and now it was upon him. The Hangdogs had finally slipped up revealing their weakness, and he had a real army - veteran soldiers, a proper command structure, and plenty of disposable meatshields. It was time to march back into Denver with his army raised, and show the people that the city belongs to Ghouls!"
  nf_whd.14.a:0 ""Get out of my city!""

  nf_whd.15.t:0 "Back In My Shack"
  nf_whd.15.d:0 "Old Dog's house was gone, reduced to cinders long ago. No, he wasn't getting misty eyed about America again; he meant his house in Denver. \n\nThe Hangdogs were a real pack of rabid savages. Reminded him of some of the scum he'd seen on the campaign trail, those grubby little freaks that screamed about 'American oppression'. You can't be oppressed by the soldiers of freedom, he'd always tell them. Never seemed to stop them from firebombing things. \n\nBut that didn't matter now. The Hangdogs could blow his house down, but he and the boys would just build it back better. He was gonna have a big beautiful house, with a big beautiful door. That door would always be open to a red-blooded Ghoul. A Ghoul that still loved their country, and just wanted to wipe the ash off it."
  nf_whd.15.a:0 "Home is where the heart is."
  nf_whd.16.t:0 "Why Stop Here?"
  nf_whd.16.d:0 "Some of their less dedicated brethren wanted to stop here. 'We have Denver back', they said, 'why would we need to go any further?' \n\nAnother memory of the Old World; those spineless cowards that opposed the wars. Content to feast on the fruits of hard won victories, but quailing in fright when the time came to fight for them. They tried to dress it up as some humanitarian bullshit, but at the end of the day they were abandoning America to suffer a long death. \n\nOld Dog knew that one day, any day, all the Smoothskins around them would come for them again. If they rested on their laurels, their enemies would pick at them until they were dead. He wasn't going to let it happen again. \n\nColorado would be theirs. It didn't belong to no stinking savages or sneering settlers. It was land for Ghoulish patrioits alone!"

  nf_whd.17.t:0 "Colorado Department Of Ghoulish Relations"
  nf_whd.17.d:0 "He didn't exactly like the feel of it. The job title made him sound like one of those Federal pencil pushers, some asshole who stood around making life difficult for the boys doing real work. \n\nBut it served a purpose. This WARDEN, he still didn't have it all working upstairs, so he decided the Ghouls needed special treatment owing to their 'disability'. He offered for Old Dog to head this new 'government department' as 'a respected leader of America's disadvantaged community'. The language alone made his skin crawl, but he could see past that. What it meant practically was that WARDEN would transfer all Ghoulish recruits to his jurisdiction, where he would explain what was really going on and get them on board with his vision. \n\nSure, it meant tolerating WARDEN's eccentricities, and tolerating his tolerance of Smoothies. But it'd give Old Dog a shot in the arm, and the Ghouls a place of their own to live."

  nf_whd.18.t:0 "Where Do Ghouls Fit In The New World Order?"
  nf_whd.18.d:0 "Brave and stalwart peacekeepers, or so the government line went. Owing to their unique capabilities and eternal dedication, Old Dog's boys were to form an Autonomous Unit that would spearhead 'peacekeeping' efforts in states that remained in anarchy. A funny thing to imagine given they were allegedly 'disabled', but they all knew that was crap. \n\nReally, Old Dog could scarcely imagine a better gig. There was a whole country of Smoothskins out there, acting like vicious idiots with no respect for the land they occupied. It would be his pleasure to put them all down and remind them that the Star Spangled Banner yet waved. Maybe the big boss didn't really understand what was happening out there, but the government was always a little out of touch with the soldiery. \n\nThe best part was he was explicitly ordered to keep an eye out for any 'Communist Saboteurs' that threatened their efforts. Just like the good old days. Old Dog wouldn't even hesitate."

  nf_whd.19.d:0 "Old Dog looked himself over in the mirror once again. A fine looking man for a 200 year old corpse. He even had a toupee to put on now. They weren't able to get it looking just like his old hair, but hey, at least he had hair now. \n\nOn the desk in his room was a request from Joe, the cosmetician they had doing a lot of this work. He claimed he was dead tired after doing work on so many faces and asked for more compensation. Old Dog was tempted to tell the dumb bastard that he should try bleeding for his country if he wanted to be paid well, but he'd settle for just throwing his letter in the bin. \n\nHe was a busy man, after all. Today there was a new workshop opening downtown. Some young buck Ghouls were planning a protest over wages. He and the boys were gonna go down there and remind them what Americans do to Commie sympathizers. Freedom wasn't free, it had to be fought for, again and again. \n\nFortunately, Old Dog now had all the time in the world to fight for it."

  nf_whd.20.d:0 "Eli never thought he'd end up serving with the Withered Dogs again. \n\nFrankly, he thought they would have killed him the moment they captured him. They certainly made it sound bad enough during their 'trial'. Traitors to all Ghoul-kind, they called them. A few poor bastards were dead now for refusing the offer that was made to them. \n\nBut Eli had taken it. An offer of freedom in exchange for service. Pick up his rifle once more and fight for the 'right cause'. He wasn't even sure why he agreed. Perhaps his will to live was just that strong? Or maybe he was a coward? \n\nHe was already regretting his choice. By Old Dog's decree, anyone who had once fought for the Smoothskins had to be marked as such, with a badge of shame they'd have to wear until they died."

  nf_whd.21.d:0 "America had its share of weird little cults before it was set on fire. Old Dog can still foggily remember a news report or two about those weirdos. It was the Luminous Ones that reminded him most of those murderous nutjobs. \n\nThese Cradle people weren't that much like them, as far as he could tell. They were more like hippies. They greeted him with all this claptrap about peace and embracing their fellow man. He received a personal lecture from the Glowing Father on the virtues of pacifism. It was enough to make him sick. The Luminous ones might have been a pack of psychos, but at least they had the balls to stand up for Ghoul-kind. \n\nStill, Old Dog was practical enough not to turn away a friend and ally when they could be of use. If he could put up with Zhang, he could put up with this hipster commune too. Perhaps through tepidly warm relations, they might even see a Ghoul or two wander south when they got tired of listening to the Glowing Father."

He'd been a bit worried he'd be more of a pansy after hearing he was originally in the Chair Force, but Chris Harrison was a proper soldier in his soul. A leader of men, a seasoned Ghoul. A pity about some of the company he kept, but he could admit Smoothskins had a use. \n\nThe two of them shared a drink on Oklahoman soil. Boy howdy, could Chris pack them in! He was regaled with tales of his casino adventures. Old Dog hadn't heard such funny stories in decades. The two of them reminisced on days gone by in service of the United States. Old Dog chalked it up to the drink, but he felt like Chris didn't remember his experiences quite as fondly. \n\nThe two of them parted as brothers, committed to a Ghoulish kinship between their two bands of old soldiers."

Not that he wasn't in the same boat. \n\nOld Dog was taken on a tour of the Los Alamos facilities. He was quite impressed, not just by the technological marvel they presented, but by the order into which the Colonel had whipped his troops. He was a solid man of soldiery. Just a pity he didn't seem as interested in waving the ol' stars and stripes, or he'd be a man after Old Dog's heart. \n\nRegardless, the Reservation under Colonel Green presented a good friend and ally. He wasn't sure if these pipe dreams about Ghoul children would pan out properly, but if they ever did, that'd be another notch on the belt of Ghoul-kind's superiority."
