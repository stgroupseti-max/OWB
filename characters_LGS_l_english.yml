  LGS_ZORRO_DE_CHIHUAHUA_DESC:0 "The people of the Chihuahua desert are hardy folk; they grow their crops on land where naturally only cactuses prevail. They battle the sun and the drought and still emerge victorious. Because they not only survive but create life, the wastelanders call this region "the Breadbasket of Mexico" for a reason. \n\nBut there are more enemies here besides the weather and the wildlife. The ever-expanding flawed democracy to the east would be happy if we would join their state, cartels to the south, and the scrouge of the wasteland, the Legion, to the north. The "granjero" are sturdy but cannot fight against such enemies, as they come with brute force, dark schemes and honeyed words. The Fox of Chihuahua swore they would protect this piece of land against everything, even if the odds looked like they found themselves cornered.\n\nThe Fox itself is a mystery, as no one saw their face before, and they just appeared one day and took the mantle. Are they disgraced luchador who lost their mask? A former cartel thug, now hiding their true identity to save their hide? Or, in the same manner, a Legion slave who cannot return to Arizona? Nobody knows for sure. One thing is certain, however - they're here, and they will stay."
