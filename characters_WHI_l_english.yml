  WHI_PATHFINDER_DESC:0 "Leadership was not on the books for Pathfinder as a young man, rather, he intended to become a farmer. However, due to the rise of the Kamlo Survivalists, many of Whistler's elders were killed, and it fell to the next generation of able men to lead the way. Thus Kirima became Pathfinder."
