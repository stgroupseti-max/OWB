 sle_muster_the_sleepers_desc:0 "Our advance scouts suggest the Ouroboros are mobilizing to get ready for war with [TOB.GetLeader] and his tribe. Whichever side wins, we cannot trust that they won't turn their attention to us next. We need to get ready for war."
 sle_mesmetron:0 "Produce Mesmetrons"
 sle_mesmetron_desc:0 "The Mesmetron is a useful tool, neural-psychic device that puts its targets into a suggestible state for a brief time. While the programming still needs some work and there's a risk of a catastrophic backfire, the reputation alone of the device can help keep peace and order in an area."
 sle_medical_expertise:0 "Medical Expertise"
 sle_medical_expertise_desc:0 "Boulder Dome was built as a medical research facility first and foremost, with all other research being secondary. Many of our Pre-War Sleepers have doctorates in fields that haven't existed for 200 years, that could be used to finish research they started before the war and find new ways to improve humanity."
 sle_armored_suits:0 "Armored Hazmat Suits"
 sle_armored_suits_desc:0 "Boulder Dome had extensive decontamination measures designed to combat the most potent plagues in human history, including the deadly New Plague. Part of this was a set of advanced HAZMAT suits that were resistant to penetration not only by disease, but most forms of weaponry as well."
 sle_riot_control:0 "Advanced Armor Schematics"
 sle_riot_control_desc:0 "Relying purely on our supply of armor from Boulder Dome would be incredibly foolish of us. Without the facilities of Boulder Dome it will be challenging to recreate our pre-war armor, but hardly impossible."
 sle_willing_subjects:0 "Willing Subjects"
 sle_willing_subjects_desc:0 "Despite what some may believe, the Sleepers have never been concerned with the purity of only including pre-war humans in their ranks. The Dryblowers were not well educated, but a few bright minds have been educated and will be inducted into the illustrious ranks of our scientsts."
 sle_new_base:0 "Build A New compound"
 sle_new_base_desc:0 "Our Exodus from Boulder Dome as left us crammed inside one of Presper's personal laboratories or sharing quarters with the Dryblowers. These living conditions are a far cry from the luxury of an automated city of tomorrow, and its time we expanded the lab into a proper new town to house our ranks."
 sle_scavenging:0 "Scavenging The Colorado"
 sle_scavenging_desc:0 "The Colorado river has accumulated a lot of garbage since the war. Even if it makes us little better than the Foragers, scavenging what we can from the shallows and dredging up anything new that passes by could yield some much needed raw materials to build new machines."
 sle_loyal_soldiers:0 "Loyal Soldiers"
 sle_loyal_soldiers_desc:0 "Presper didn't just recruit scientists into the Sleepers before the Great War, but soldiers as well. A backbone of loyal muscle and armed guards from the military would be essential to keeping the Sleepers safe from the threats of the apocalypse. The surviving soldiers continue to do just that, while training another generation in pre-war tactics."
 sle_armory:0 "Standardized Armory"
 sle_armory_desc:0 "Concentrating our production with standardized parts and designs will help our production of new weapons. Yes, every scientist here has made at least one personal death-ray, but custom projects need to be put aside for the sake of mass production if we want enough guns to actually win wars."
 sle_broken_bones:0 "Sticks and Stones"
 sle_broken_bones_desc:0 "The Old Bones are, more than even the wild John Lynch, are literally cavemen. To share a border with such primitives is not only an insult but a liability for the future. We need to wipe them out before they get any ideas about raiding us."
 sle_serpents_head:0 "The Serpent's Head"
 sle_serpents_head_desc:0 "Hecate is a name spoken of in whispers, and she still remembers the terror the Sleepers once inflicted upon the region. We need to remove her from power before she rallies an army to destroy us!"
 sle_pulp_villains:0 "Pulp Villainy!"
 sle_pulp_villains_desc:0 "With The Old Bones defeated, we need to figure out what to do with the surviving members of the tribe. Some of them are callling us silly things like "Cyclopses" and "Mad Science Men!" inspired by their comic book culture. Maybe we could lean in on this reputation?"
 sle_new_darkness:0 "A New Darkness Rises"

 sle_agricola:0 "The Mechanical Marvels of Agricola"
 sle_agricola_desc:0 "The Agricola mining company working in Burnham Springs was a subsidiary of of Poseidon Energy, a company whose schematics we have extensive access to. Combining what we already know with the fresh access to equipment from the mines will help kick start our industry all over again."
 sle_gehenna:0 "Burham's Strange Mutant Oddity"
 sle_gehenna_desc:0 "The caves under Burnham Springs are filled with strange mutants, with tar like flesh and bulbous growths across their body. How Fascinating! We could certainly find uses for them in our forces, and even clone more of the strange creatures for medical research."
 sle_disappointing_results:0 "Hecate's Folly"

 sle_bioweapons:0 "Bioweapon Development"
 sle_bioweapons_desc:0 "Part of Presper's ultimate plan was to escalate the threat level of Colorado by releasing carriers of the New Plague from Tibbets Prison. We still have samples that could be deployed behind enemy lines to great effect, if we were willing to overlook the ethical implications."
 sle_mass_mesmetrons:0 "Mass Scale Mesmetrons"
 sle_mass_mesmetrons_desc:0 "The Mesmetron is a powerful device in the right hands for controlling individuals, but to use it on the battlefield has always been a challenge. Developing tactics for full squad saturation should allow us to quietly disrup the enemy without raising any alarms."
 sle_geckos:0 "Gather Geckos"
 sle_geckos_desc:0 "Geckos are one of the many rapidly breeding species of new life evolved to survive in the wasteland, and one that is surprisingly easy to tame. Breeding them to supplement our existing forces will allow us to protect our own lives with theirs."
 sle_doggos:0 "Security Dogs"
 sle_doggos_desc:0 "Boulder Dome Security made extensive use of cyberdogs even before the war, and continued experiments after the war under Presper's watchful eye. Our initial plans were to breed an army to fight our battles for us, but after meeting a talking Cyberdog most of our scientists agreed they wanted to focus on inventing more of those instead."
 sle_in_a_cave:0 "Rebuilding Our Dream!"
 sle_in_a_cave_desc:0 "Some might say our efforts to rebuild everything that was lost with Presper is an impossible dream. But with all the technology collected by Hecate, the treasures of Burnham Springs, and the accumulated knowledge of the Sleepers, nothing will stop us from reclaiming our rightful destiny."
 sle_uintah_eagles:0 "The Western Bank"
 sle_uintah_eagles_desc:0 "Our path forward will require returning to our past. B.O.M.B.2 is still not under our full control, if we want to extract the full potential of the station we will have to make our way back. That begins with securing the other bank of the Colorado, and subjugating the tribals that call it home."
 sle_crazy_horns:0 "Smash Their Horns"
 sle_crazy_horns_desc:0 "The Crazy Horns are a violent and dangerous tribe, with a collection of deathclaws we would like to study. Advancing the border with them will allow acces to both the Sorrows land and some fun new test subjects!"
 sle_dead_horses:0 "Poor Horses"
 sle_dead_horses_desc:0 "The Dead Horses tribe is a tragic reminder for some of our pre-war scientists with equestrian experience that most horses are, in fact, dead. Pushing them out and re-naming the area on the map will probably make them feel much better."
 sle_our_sorrows:0 "Drowning Our Sorrows"
 sle_our_sorrows_desc:0 "The Sorrows tribe views our Sleeper soldiers as monsters, strange creatures that touch the taboo places of the past they refuse to go. Their strange naivety and innocence is almost charming, but we need full control of the Grand Canyon and B.O.M.B.2. to finish restoring our former glory."
 sle_back_to_bomb:0 "Back To B.O.M.B."
 sle_back_to_bomb_desc:0 "Our long journey to connect our lost station with our main laboratories has finally paid off, and with extra benefits too. With large amounts of advanced technology to relocate, we could turn the self sustaining systems into the foundation of an entirely new community!"
 sle_restart_BOMB:0 "Restart BOMB Sattelite Connection"
 sle_restart_BOMB_desc:0 "One of the pieces of BOMB 2 that still works is its communications array, which was retracted into the hull before the station de-orbited. Resetting it could enable us to connect with remaining communication sattelites, however few there are left."
 sle_old_friends_folly:0 "Old Friend's Folly"
 sle_old_friends_folly_desc:0 "Battery of Mesa Verde was an ambitious man, who often clashed with Xian on their mutual travels with The Prisoner. Though they bonded through hardship, Xian could never understand his obsession with democracy, and never liked the Black Canyon project. Perhaps it's time to figure out which companion was always better."
 sle_glowbugs:0 "Bug Off"
 sle_glowbugs_desc:0 "The Glowbugs are the final obstacle to our quest to go home, to return to Boulder Dome. There are still more Sleepers, frozen in the decaying facility, that must be recovered at any cost."
 sle_home_again:0 "Home Again"
 sle_home_again_desc:0 "With Boulder Dome finally under our control again, we can finally start restoring the facility to full operations and use it as our main command center once again."
 sle_other_sleepers:0 "The Other Sleepers"
 sle_other_sleepers_desc:0 "Before the war, countless scientists and soldiers were frozen away in Boulder Dome's Cryogenics facilities, all to survive the coming apocalypse. Presper programmed the system to wake him up earlier than the rest, so he could select only the best and most loyal Sleepers to wake up. We cannot be so discerning; It's time to wake up everyone else."
 sle_computer_eyes:0 "Computer Eyes"
 sle_computer_eyes_desc:0 "The ZAX in Boulder Dome is, by the time we reached it, virtually unsalvagable. Centuries of research data will be lost but we have little choice but to reset it and use it to help jumpstart research on new, better supercomputers to replace it with some day."
 sle_rocky_ridges:0 "Rocky Ridges"
 sle_rocky_ridges_desc:0 "The Rockies are home to a large amount of technological salvage we're going to need if we want to build up an actual industrial base. A bunch of salvagers from Denver have already "claimed" it, and will have to be subdued first."
 sle_math_masters:0 "Mathematical Masters"
 sle_math_masters_desc:0 "The Ciphers of Mesa Verde are an interesting bunch for sure, capable of memorizing entire schematics taught using their geoglyphs. Their culture is one that could actually be useful to preserve, albeit for the role of low level technicians and codebreakers."
 sle_nursery:0 "Trip To The Nursery"
 sle_nursery_desc:0 "Unlike most of the Sleepers, Xian has actually been to The Nursery before, visiting once with The Prisoner to help repair Diana's Robobrain body. As such she is under no delusions about the "Goddess" and her true nature, and isn't afraid to return to ask her for some help."
 sle_code:0 "C.O.D.E."
 sle_code_desc:0 "The CODE visual language is so much more than a means of flushing brains to prepare for Robobrain insertion. By flashing it to soldiers in the field we can improve moral, or create stations that cause our citizens to remain obedient even in times of crisis. With enough video feeds the possibilites are endless..."
 sle_geck:0 "Swiping a GECK"
 sle_geck_desc:0 "Rebuilding the Wasteland in our own image is going to require more than just wiping the slate of other nations, it's also going to require rebuilding that world better than before. Use of a Garden of Eden Creation Kit "borrowed" from The Nursery will help to jump start the process."
 sle_educational_investment:0 "Invest In Tribal Education"
 sle_educational_investment_desc:0 "Most Sleepers believe that tribals are, by the very nature of growing up in a tribal society, incapable of learning how to be anything more than mere laborers, that it will take generations before their descendants have a chance to prove themselves worthy. Xian has a different perspective, being a wastelander hand recruited to the group by Presper herself. Maybe they only need a chance to prove themselves?"
 sle_dream_sequencer:0 "Dream Sequencer"
 sle_dream_sequencer_desc:0 "Living in reality is an exercise in exhaustion. Rather than relying on the mundane world around us to do research, we can combine CODE system with pre-war memory lounger technology to create high speed simulated realities where our Sleepers can not only collaborate remotely, but explore each other's memories or work in environments that no longer exist on earth."
 sle_universal_migrators:0 "Universal Migrators"
 sle_universal_migrators_desc:0 "Integrating the new ZAX into our simulation pods has enabled us to upgrade our Dream Sequencers into a more advanced system, able to send signals to the human brain at an unprecedented rate and vastly expanding the scope of the simulation. With enough upgrades to our bodies, we could experience lifetimes in the simulator in mere hours. We finally have enough time to learn everything."
 sle_creature_science:0 "Medical Miracles"
 sle_creature_science_desc:0 "With Boulder Dome back under our control we can finish our research into the Pan Immunity Virion and FEV! While it will take years to fully master the potential of these pathogens, we could get started by testing on mutant wildlife."
 sle_waking_up:0 "Finally Waking Up"
 sle_waking_up_desc:0 "Finally, after months of conquest and research, we are approaching the levels of a true technological power that can compete with the NCR, or at least defend against its invasions. The matter of our future remains to be decided, but the Sleepers are finally starting to awaken their full potential."

 nf_sle.1.t:0 "The Sixth Extinction"
 nf_sle.1.d:0 "In the final hours before the Great War's end, the brilliant Vivtor Presper created a plan to outlive the apocalypse. Unrivaled in his genius he gathered a following among the soldiers and scientists of Boulder Dome, and used advanced cryo-sleep pods to wait out the worst of the fallout. When they awoke they tried to learn about the wasteland, visiting the NCR in the process. But Presper was not impressed. He returned to Colorado with his loyal Sleepers, and set in motion a plan to cause a second nuclear apocalypse using the B.O.M.B. space station, and left the planet with the loyal elite of the Sleepers.\n\nBut not everything went according to plan.\nA Prisoner from Tibbets Prison, released as a part of the scheme, managed to follow the Sleepers and uncover their plan, eventually making the journey to B.O.M.B. 1. The station was destroyed, and Presper and his most elite followers were killed, ending their plan to destroy the world again."
 nf_sle.1.a:0 "And the Sleepers were left without a leader..."
 nf_sle.2.t:0 "Starting Over"
 nf_sle.2.d:0 "With Presper and the leadership of the Sleepers dead, the future of the organization looked bleak. Survivors were branded terrorists by the NCR, and there was little refuge for them in Colorado. They would have disbanded completely if not for a strange signal that went out a few weeks after BOMB's destruction. The signal lead the surviving Sleepers to Presper's Laboratory, where Xian was waiting for them.\n\nXian had walked many roads in her life, working for the Shi when she was younger, meeting Presper during his trip to the NCR, and following him back east to Boulder Dome. What the Sleepers who had gathered did not know was that she had also traveled with the Prisoner, learning from them about the wasteland and helping them save it in the end. Xian had gathered the Sleepers here to wipe them out forever, but when they arrived she could not help but pity them. She too was one of them once, and she had found new meaning in the world without Presper. Perhaps, with a little guidance, she could change their ways as well?"
 nf_sle.2.a:0 "What they don't know won't hurt them, right?"
 nf_sle.3.t:0 "Dream Sequencing"
 nf_sle.3.d:0 "With the Sleepers gathered in one place, and Xian taking command, the need to decide the next course of action was obvious. The first thing they would need is to replenish their depleted ranks. The Dryblowers were a small force in the region, weak and full of hatred for Hecate, looking desperately for a future. Xian approached their leader John Lynch, and promised them a future free of the Ouroboros reign of terror.\n\nThe new influx of workers and even students slowly being trained in the Sleeper's ways has breathed new life into the cause, restoring morale and faith in the movement. But a question has been spreading between Sleepers new and old: What exactly IS their plan going forward? Before moving forward, Xian had to offer an answer."
 nf_sle.3.a:0 "To do better than last time!"

 nf_sle.4.t:0 "Conquer or be Conquered"
 nf_sle.4.d:0 "The Old Bones have fallen to our mighty science! [TOB.GetLeader] is bound and captured, paraded about and humiliated. Cursory research by the few Sleepers experienced in social science has quickly revealed that their culture has been significantly shaped by their love of stories, be they fictional or historical. The grief of their recent memories has left them vulnerable, creating a few comments about how we could twist that to our advantage. Teach them a version of events with an ending where we work together. \n\nWhat started as a lighthearted jest has evolved into a genuine debate. Would that really work? Was there any chance of [TOB.GetLeader] accepting the offer and fighting for the Sleepers? Or was the whole discussion a waste of time? The Director had the final say on how to deal with the Old Bones."

 nf_sle.5.t:0 "The Last Queen of Ouroboros" #Parralels Cleopatra, i.e. the Last Queen of Egypt
 nf_sle.5.d:0 "The soldiers of the Sleepers moved in formation as they breached the Dark Pyramid, their sterile uniforms cutting stark lines against the deep blacks and purples of Ouroboros. The synthetic obsidian walls, polished to a mirrored sheen, warped their reflections—turning their pale shapes into ghostly silhouettes. Even natives could lose their way in these twisting halls; for outsiders, it was a maze of shadow and glass.\nIt was forbidden to bring weapons into the Dark Pyramid—one of Ouroboros's oldest tenats. Yet the priestesses of Hecate led them in silence. Clad in deep indigo robes, their faces painted in violet and ash, they walked with heads held high but eyes dark with quiet fury. The sanctuary had fallen, but they clung to dignity and rite.\n\nAt last, they reached the Umbral Adytum, buried deep in the heart of the Pyramid. The room was dim, lit only by low-burning lamps. Strange machines lined the walls—pulleys and winches connected to sealed crates and reliquaries. Wires snaked to a central pyre, wrapped around glass canisters filled with alchemical oils. Overhead, a great chain hung from the ceiling, attached to a final release. Everything had been prepared to burn.\nStacks of tomes and holodisks were arranged beside tribal relics. The sealed key to her laboratory—rumored to hold Diana's last secrets—rested atop scrolls and treasures gathered over a lifetime.\n\nIn the center sat Hecate, draped in black and violet, upon a throne of shattered metal and silk, her face pale beneath painted sigils. Though her world had crumbled, she remained a queen.\nOn a obsidian plinth, a letter lay—written in the flowing script of the Daughters:\n\n\"Ouroboros will pay its tithe to the Disciples of Presper. Its armies will be no more. But my Daughters and our faith will remain. The Dark Pyramid shall raise no sword, but its fires will not be quenched. Should my demands be denied, all that you see—my treasures, my works, and myself—will burn, and the last light of Ouroboros will die with me.\"\n\nThe letter lies open on Xian's desk, delivered by her assistant—its dark ink stark against the sterile papers and sealed reports."
 nf_sle.5.a:0 "Accept her terms. A broken goddess can do no harm."
 nf_sle.5.b:0 "Refuse. Let her and her secrets burn."
 nf_sle.5.c:0 "Offer exile. She leaves the Dark Pyramid forever."
 nf_sle.5.a.tt:0 "§gHecate's demands are accepted, and she descends from the Umbral Adytum with the dignity of a fallen queen. Though her armies are broken and her throne stripped of power, she does not fade. Instead, she becomes a spiritual figurehead, her voice still heeded in the dark halls of the pyramid. At the insistence of the Disciples of Presper, Hecate orders her Daughters to refrain from violence against their new overlords. Yet even so, her influence remains. Whispers in the city speak of her working quietly to guide Ouroboros toward a new future—one born not of swords, but of faith and shadow.§!"
 nf_sle.5.b.tt:0 "§gThe demands are refused. The Sleepers watch from behind the mirrored walls as the pulleys are released and the flames roar to life. Hecate's cackling laughter echoes through the pyramid as her life's work is consumed in violet flame. By the time the smoke clears and the soldiers breach the chamber, there is no sign of her body—only ash, melted steel, and scorched relics. The city weeps for what was lost, and though the fires have died, the embers of revolt smolder in the hearts of the people. The streets grow restless, and the Daughters slip away into the shadows.§!"
 nf_sle.5.c.tt:0 "§gHecate accepts exile, though the fury in her eyes makes clear she will not forget this slight. Stripped of her city and her throne, she gathers her remaining followers—those Daughters and warriors who choose to leave the safety of Ouroboros and walk beside her into the wasteland. The people watch in silence as she departs, a long procession winding into the desert beyond the walls. Though she is gone, her name lingers, and many wonder if the Dark Mother will one day return to reclaim what was taken from her.§!"
 #Flavor event after the burn, or exile option, talking about how 'the Dark Mother' leads Ouroboros from the shadows.
 nf_sle.500.t:0 "The Dark Mother Walks"
 nf_sle.500.d:0 "Though Ouroboros has fallen, the faith of the Dark Pyramid has not. In the months since the city's surrender, whispers have spread of a cloaked figure moving through its shadowed streets—a woman the people call the Dark Mother. She appears only by night, her face hidden beneath deep violet veils, her steps silent as mist. \n\nNone among the city's people will speak of her. The Daughters offer no answers to the Sleepers' inquiries, their lips sealed as tightly as the pyramid’s vaults. To them, this is not a woman, but something older—a truth that cannot die. \n\nOnly through observation of the city's sermons have the Sleepers gleaned fragments of understanding. The faith of Ouroboros teaches that the Dark Mother is no mere mortal, but a prophecy made flesh—a goddess of the dark moon, the mother of Ouroboros itself. Hecate is seen not as a person who once ruled, but as an eternal archetype, destined to rise again. They believe that as long as shadows fall, Hecate waits, and that in time, she will return.\n\nThe Daughters speak of cycles within cycles—of the Dark Mother's rebirth, not through flesh alone, but through the endless turning of the collective soul. And until that day comes, the Dark Mother will shepherd her people from the shadows."

 nf_sle.6.t:0 "Medical Realization"
 nf_sle.6.d:0 "Studies of the records found in Hecate's Pyramid have unveiled a horrible secret. For years, Hecate had been engaging in a crude form of eugenics, trying to control the reproduction of Ouroboros and nearby tribes in an attempt at selectively breeding stronger wastelanders. The results of this program as far as we can tell have been upsetting the nearby tribes and creating genetic bottlenecks in the nearby populations, increasing the risk of disease. Doctor Beyr was ashamed to be confronted with the data we found, and urged us not to abuse it or repeat her mistakes. The Sleepers all agree something as pedestrian and pseudoscientific as eugenics would never be worth the effort, but Beyr's request not to abuse the data sparked an investagtion into it. The Ouroboros kept very good records of all of their efforts, to the extent we could actually detangle the convoluted lineages of tribals in the region and use it as actual medical data. We could try to use the Genealogy records to improve medical treatment of the tribals under our control, or reveal the truth to them to discredit Hecate's rule and cement our own. Either way, Beyr and all his research has been seized for our benefit."

Then it was a several hour vertical climb to even get to the secret laboratory where the ZAX computers were held. Such laborious physical exercise made Xian long for the convenience of a Vertibird. Hopefully the riches she hoped to gain from this trip would make the journey worthwhile.\nShe strode with purpose through the facility. Xian had been here before. She knew the systems-- knew the blindspots in Diana's defenses-- she knew where her heart lay. There was no purpose in reminiscing or searching the facility for other salvage. When she arrived before the central computer, she finally spoke up after several days of silent exertion.\n"Diana. I’ve come to collect on the debt you owe me."\nDespite everything, Diana remained determined to keep up the ridiculous facade of godhood even towards those who knew her true nature. She responded with text on a screen nearby\n"I OWE YOU NOTHING. YOU WERE PAID IN FULL THE DAY YOU RENDERED AID UNTO ME. YOU INSULT ME WITH THIS BRAZEN DEMAND."\n"You owe me a debt for your continued existence. Your defenses were still mostly asleep. Without me, a particularly determined mole rat could have gotten in and chewed up your precious new brain casing. Is your life truly so cheap to refuse my help Diana?"\nA pregnant pause filled the air before the whirr of processing units resumed.\n"YOU ARE ARROGANT TO ASSUME THAT YOU DESERVE MORE THAN YOU WERE GRANTED. BE THANKFUL I DO NOT RIDDLE YOUR CORPSE WITH HOLES FROM LASER TURRET FIRE."\n"My people need a GECK. And any insight into research you can spare. I know you have plenty of them kicking around here collecting dust. You have enough to provide them to half the groups in Colorado. I am not asking for much more considering the wealth of resources you hold."\n It took a moment before a simple reply was printed onto the computer screen nearby\n"AND IF I REFUSE?"\n"I leave behind the pulse bomb that I brought all this way with me. It wouldn't kill you, no, but it would certainly set you back a few years."\nThe response given on the screen a moment later was exactly what Xian wanted to hear."#by Arksmith

 nf_sle.8.t:0 "Back In Boulder (Dome)"
 nf_sle.8.d:0 "It's been decades since the Sleepers first left Boulder Dome, abandoning their research and invaluable technology to flee the NCR's violent retaliation. The Dome was their home, the one fixture of pre-war civilization that still remained, the only thing that anchored many of them to a shared sense of identity. When it was abandoned it took an almost holy place in the Sleepers' collective psyche, a symbol of their lost dreams of the future.\n\nNow, after all these years, we control the dome again. All challengers have been defeated, the entrance unsealed, and old projects are being checked on, documented, and hopefully restarted. Finally, we are home."
 nf_sle.8.a:0 "And we will never abandon it again."
 nf_sle.9.t:0 "Rise Up! You Must Awake!"
 nf_sle.9.d:0 "Xian took a moment to consider the recent strings of success the Sleepers had faced. Western Colorado had fallen. The pathetic tribes of Utah had been conquered. The Sleepers had finally secured the technology and industry to start rebuilding the wasteland in their own image. Despite the odds, the band of lost scientists she had lured to kill had turned their luck around, and taken back all that she had once helped take from them. Or rather, almost everything.\n\nBloomfield Space Center had been taken and ransacked by raiders and barbarians. The NCR would never allow her to visit her old family and friends in the Shi again, branding anyone associated with the Sleepers terrorists. Colorado was still under the control of hostile forces, threatening to invade Boulder once again. The Sleepers could never truly rest until every front was covered, every enemy destroyed, every nation brought to heel. But they had rested long enough. She finally understood the potential they held within, just waiting to be awakened. She was never one for big speeches, but she knew she had to make a statement to the Sleepers, to inspire them to keep going. This was only the beginning after all..."

 sle_burn_the_world_decision_desc:0 ""The NCR ruined everything. It ruins everything it touches! Any chance at rebuilding a new, better world, they stifle and crush in favor of a lumbering system that Bears all the flaws of the old world. The Legion is no better, nothing but a bunch of Bull-headed luddites that want to regress even further somehow! The wasteland is hopeless. Presper was right. Burn it all down. Begin Again.""
 sle_sleep_forever_decision:0 "Sleep Forever"
 sle_sleep_forever_decision_desc:0 ""Truth be told, I was never supposed to lead the Sleepers. I was a friend of the very same Prisoner that killed Presper long ago, and when she left I took it upon myself to find a way to trap them and prevent them from threatening the wasteland ever again. It was my weakness, my foolish hope that their genius could be turned to good that told me to spare them. Now, with Boulder Dome and their blind obedience, I can finally seal away the worst of them forever.""

 sle_medicine_category_desc:0 "With the medical research team hard at work, every new medical innovation we discover will enable us to further our research into augmentation of already living human beings to absolute perfection, to create a new army of the pure, defined not by birth but by the equitable iron fist of science!"
 sle_breakthrough_1_decision:0 "Baby Steps"
 sle_breakthrough_1_decision_desc:0 "Mass Producing life changing injections, biocybernetics, and mutant flesh to graft is not an easy process.

 sle_breakthrough_2_decision:0 "Wasteland Adaptation"
 sle_breakthrough_2_decision_desc:0 "The Wasteland is full of strange new plants and animals, all of which need to be analyzed and tested for their potential pharmaceutical benefits.

 sle_breakthrough_5_decision_desc:0 "Dealing with pain in a world full of it is a challenge even for the best of the best.

 sle_daddyo_decision:0 "Remedial Mood Stabilizers"
 sle_daddyo_decision_desc:0 "Depression and lack of focus are horrible problems for the Sleepers, especially those who remember the Old World fondly.

 sle_mentats_decision:0 "Curtail Mentat Abuse"
 sle_mentats_decision_desc:0 "Mentats are great! Everyone loves them, especially scientists and students cramming to some day prove themselves worthy of becomming scientists.

 SLE_khan_radaway:0 "Regenerative Radiation Removal"
 SLE_khan_radaway_desc:0 "Extensive study of ghouls has revealed a potential cheat code in the matter of radiation resistance in humans. By artificially ghoulifying a few cells and inserting them in key locations in the body, it's possible to create what are effectively localized radiation scrubbers in the human body, without any risk of rejection!
