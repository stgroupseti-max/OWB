    WEN_MAYOR_MARIA_DESC:0 "Maria is a beloved leader - a strong term, although she was hated and despised for the last couple of years. When the Eighties' Motor-Warband first arrived, Maria was the mayor of Wendover, and she did the most unexpected and unacceptable act of all - she let them in and welcomed them with open arms as their new overlords. Because of that, she lost everything - her role, the people's love, and her city.\n\nBut now, as they got defeated, only Wendover can say about itself despite the occupation, not only did they get spared from the looting, but Flagman even spent a lot of caps on developing his "parking lot". Now everybody recognizes the mayor's foresight and wiseness and impatiently awaits how she will fare now that the town is free again."
