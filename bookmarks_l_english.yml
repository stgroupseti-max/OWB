  ### OTHER ###
  OTHER_OWB_DESC:0 "The Great War plunged the world into seemingly eternal darkness and threw everything into chaos. People struggled to survive and over the decades the survivors banded into larger and larger groups.\n\nSettlers continue on in an attempt to retain the morals of the old world. Tribals stalk the lands of their ancestors, hunting and avoiding the technology left behind by the old world. Raiders continue to dominate the wasteland, killing, pillaging, and burning. Resources are scarce and the numerous communities of the wasteland are always struggling to survive."

  WC_NAME:0 "West Coast"
  WC_DESC:0 "£GFX_west_coast_overlay                                                                                    Scorched by nuclear fire, and the flames of wars to follow, the West Coast of America has many stories to tell. This is where the Master formed Unity, where the Enclave announced themselves to the world, and where the NCR was born. It is a crucible of great and terrible powers, and the decisions made by its past inhabitants echo across the wasteland to this day. The influence of the West Coast cannot be overstated, within its lands are numerous powerful nations, such as the scheming city states New Reno and Vault City, the aloof and often righteous Desert Rangers, and the staunch and decaying Brotherhood of Steel. The West is the land of aging titans and rising superpowers.\n\nDespite already overcoming many crises, the West Coast is far from safe. The balance of power is in a state of upheaval as the NCR, bloated and overstretched, struggles to keep the Republic intact and exert its true power. Worse still, the security the Colorado afforded the NCR is a thing of the past: as the East has fallen to a conqueror. Caesar's Legion, a mighty slaver empire ruled by a former Follower that follows Roman doctrine and enforces luddism, continues to empower itself with blood and soil, threatening the status quo with sharpened sticks and machetes. These two powers will inevitably collide, the Bull skewering a sickened Bear upon its horns, and the fragile peace of the last few decades will be burned away once again."
  NCR_OWB_DESC:0 "Despite the staggering losses at the Battle of Navarro, the NCR achieved victory with the aide of the Brotherhood. Decades later tensions with their former allies are running high, and their army has fallen from grace; becoming a mess of undertrained and underequipped soldiers with no standardisation.\n\nThe Bear looks to the east with concern, as reports of Caesar's Legion's rapid growth continue to flood in. To the north the city states grow powerful and the republic debates intervention, while to the south Baja and the Brotherhood continue to be a thorn in the bear's side."
  MOT_OWB_DESC:0 "While the first NCR troopers marched into the Mojave as early as 2253, it was not until the discovery of the Hoover Dam in 2273 that the NCR realised the importance of the desert. The initial occupation progressed smoothly, and in just four months the NCR captured the Hoover Dam. \n\nDespite Chief Hanlon's objections, the Treaty of New Vegas was signed in 2274. For Oliver, the treaty made sense in the face of a resurgent Mojave Brotherhood. The NCR may have been able to seize the Mojave, but the question looms: will they be able to keep it?"
  CES_OWB_DESC:0 "Founded by a group of hostages captured by the Blackfoot Tribe, nobody could have realised how far Caesar would take the tribals under him. Almost two decades later and the Legion is fighting numerous wars of conquest, having absorbed tens of tribes and stripped them of their identities; converting them to Caesar's cult of personality.\n\nThe Legion must consider its options. The White Legs slowly warm to the them, the Hangdogs and Twin Mothers prepare for war, and the NCR observes from a distance. However, Caesar desires the Twisted Hairs as their conquest will bring him closer to Vegas; his Rome."
  BOS_OWB_DESC:0 "Their resounding victory over the Enclave at Navarro gave the Brotherhood much to celebrate, but the following years were punishing. Jeremy Maxson died suddenly, and his successor Jonathan Maxson was killed in action. The next Maxson had been sent east to D.C., and so the Elders were forced to choose one of their own. Mari Törni, a Navarro veteran, was chosen to lead.\n\nBrotherhood operations remain the same: discover tech, steal tech, kill those who disagree. They're expanding their sphere of influence to include the Shi, the Mojave Chapter, and Arroyo. The NCR watches with caution."
  VEG_OWB_DESC:0 "Mr. House founded RobCo before the Great War, and used his wealth to build a machine to sustain his body indefinitely. Awakening late into the new age Mr. House took control over New Vegas, raising the tribes in his casinos up and giving them the gift of civilisation.\n\nMr. House desires to reclaim the platinum chip to activate his Securitrons within the Vault and upgrade their software. Vegas is filled with snakes, and befittingly it has many people who desire to topple the lofty throne of the Lucky 38. Benny, and the King are the main contenders for the top, each with their own motivations."
  VLT_OWB_DESC:0 "Surrounded by seemingly endless desert, Vault City is an oasis amongst the suffering wastes. Despite its beautiful appearance, the city is a corrupt pit of ethnocentric elitism and narcissism. Vault City is the most medically advanced faction in the wasteland, capable of cloning limbs and treating injuries that would be untreatable to others - but this knowledge remains sealed behind their walls.\n\nThe former inhabitants of Vault 8 stand at a precipice where they must decide the future of their city state. Whether they continue to spread their name in infamy remains to be seen."
  TRL_OWB_DESC:0 "Within the dark depths of a cave system in Oregon, the denizens of Troll Warren drag screaming victims into a lagoon of FEV. A former dumping ground for Mariposa Military Base, the remote caverns of the Warren are now home to tribal killers.\n\nAs the distant sound of the world ending echoed from outside, a Mariposa guard fell into the glowing lake, and emerged as the First. Old holotapes in a foreign voice remind him of his lost humanity, but they couldn't prevent his mind from slowly deteriorating. Soon the Warren will awaken, and all of Oregon will tremble."
  WBH_OWB_DESC:0 "Eternal winter shrouds the north of America, and within the blizzard a danger watches silently. Seattle is haunted by ghosts, the castoffs of the Midwest, who vengefully stalk the ruins.\n\nElder Immortal lead his few followers to Seattle hoping to found a new chapter - but his violent tactics and the dire situation turned the chapter into a monster. Violence, enslavement, and conscription have all become core tenants of a dark 'Neo Brotherhood' doctrine. The thick snowfall of Seattle is the perfect backdrop for abductions, murder, and the subjugation of the few who remain."
  NEW_OWB_DESC:0 "Reno is known for little more than the stench of sex and jet fumes. Its dubious abodes are packed full of scum, all crowded around games of dice, cards, and women. Alcohol is the blood that runs through the veins of Reno's denizens.\n\nFamilies battle for influence within the city and its surroundings. They all have their own goals for the city, but only one can prevail in the grand. Outside Reno's territory the Yakuza attempt to expand what little influence they can find, but their days are numbered."
  ARR_OWB_DESC:0 "Arroyo is a nation of unity: tribals and vault dwellers joining to form a civilised society in the north. With the aid of the 'holy' Garden of Eden Creation Kit, New Arroyo has become the most prosperous and beautiful city in the wasteland, but the winds of change rustle the leaves of the forests of New Arroyo. \n\nThe Chosen One assumed the role of Elder after saving their people. There are many myths and wonderings about this land and the leader of it. Some say they were a violent lunatic who killed anyone in the pursuit of money, power, and their goals. Others say they were a benevolent person who helped everyone wherever they went."
  HAN_OWB_DESC:0 "Old world cities are frequented by scavengers and vagabonds for their precious salvage, but only the foolish or desperate would seek to plunder Dog-City. The Hangdogs dominate the towering skyscrapers of Dog-City, watching the packs of feral dogs that stalk the streets below - training their own hounds in the art of war.\n\nWith the Legion on a rapid campaign of conquest and integration, the Hangdogs cautiously watch the south as they await the arrival of the Bull. Soon, Bull and Hound will lock horn and jaw in a battle set to define Colorado for years to come."
  HEA_OWB_DESC:0 "Originally a peaceful Christian nation founded by a pastor and his congregation, Heaven's Gate has become an imposing juggernaut of military might and zealous belief in God. Its industry is almost entirely powered by steam cores, miniaturized steam generators small enough to be carried in the palm of your hand.\n\nThe Innocence Lost Massacre changed the way Heaven's Gate looked at outsiders forever. Saint Michael's rise to power only furthered the radicalisation of the clergy, and the cracks are beginning to show. Soon, all outsiders will be sinners in the eyes of the Lord."
  MOJ_OWB_DESC:0 "Founded by Father Elijah, a scribe who miraculously became an Elder within the Brotherhood, the Mojave Chapter was established for an expedition into the Mojave Desert. Despite optimistic early prospects, their results were lacking, which frustrated Elijah greatly.\n\nGrasping at the wasteland from their stronghold in Hidden Valley, the Mojave Chapter prepares to send numerous manned expeditions across the wasteland, at Elijah's frantic request. He dreams of the Old World, and of harnessing the power of the sun. Whether or not his subordinates share his vision remains to be seen."
  BRK_OWB_DESC:0 "§YFor the seasoned wastelander§!. Frigid outcroppings of stone and shattered prewar vessels compliment the twisted nature of the Broken Coast well, its shoreline dotted with miniature tragedies. Life along the coast is hard, and raiding is all the people there know. To them, violence is life itself.\n\nThe ancestors of the current pirates of the Broken Coast endured The Great Blizzard, an event immediately following the Great War, that blocked out the sky and killed untold thousands. Survival is in their blood. When settlers spot raiders from the Broken Coast, they don't fight: they run."
#  KHA_OWB_DESC:0 "Made ravenous by the numerous defeats laid at their feet, the Great Khans are desperate to prove their worth to the wasteland at large—and to themselves. With their backs against the wall as the Mojave sizes them up, they must bare their teeth, lest the Khan legacy die out with them.\n\nThe pressure is mounting as old foes rear their heads once more, and the Longhouse splinters as options lessen by the day. In the midst of the uncertainty, Papa Khan, and Regis—his right hand man—lock horns over the future of the gang. Whoever comes out on-top will change the identity of the Great Khans—forever."
  EUR_OWB_DESC:0 "Eureka's enduring presence is proof alone that miracles are possible. Driven to the edge of extinction by a Mirelurk invasion after the Great War, Eurekans struggled for generations to maintain a grip on their home. Yet while it has only been a few short decades since the Portmasters expelled the invaders Eureka has now begun to look outwards. The town itself has no interest in expansion, yet every nearby power does. Both Arroyo and the NCR will prove themselves to be existential threats in the coming years."
  MDT_OWB_DESC:0 "At one point the Marrow Drinkers were but another tribe, feasting on their own and running raids against the Bone Dancers to the east. All that has changed now with the arrival of Mesmeralda. This charismatic Viper has convinced the Marrow Drinkers that she is a queen outright! That she is the character "Mesmeralda" from the Grognak The Barbarian comics! Her "magical relics" and "alchemical treatments" able to bring just about anyone into the same line of thinking that she lives in.\nThe Queen of the Gorgons, with the Marrow Drinkers under her heel hopes to dominate all of Oregon. Will anyone be able to stop her?"
  VIC_OWB_DESC:0 "The jewel of the pacific northwest, New Victoria has stood unconquered since the fall of the Old World. Ruled by a long line of Queens and protected by an experienced admiralty who keep the shores safe, it is a bastion of stability in a chaotic region. Able to draw on the United States Militaries leftovers, as the island once acted as a staging ground for campaigns against the Chinese in both Alaska and the north pacific, they are blessed with stores of advanced technology. They will need it however, as a challenger has arisen just across the sea in the form of the Broken Coast; pirates who view the jewel of the northwest as a trophy to be plundered."
  TIM_OWB_DESC:0 "The honest and kindly folk of the Timberline are a beacon of light in a land often darkened by brutal raiders and vicious cannibals. Descended from woodsmen, boy scout troops and lumberjacks these folks live in harmony with the deep forests in which they make their home and offer refuge to travelers and those in search of aid. Cannibals looking to eschew their dark ways in particular are welcome in the Timberline, as no one is more experienced with rehabbing such unhealthy desires. Rumor holds that deeper in the woods there are even stranger folk, but odd tales are common in the wasteland."
  PMR_OWB_DESC:0 "The Maw is a haven for pirates, raiders, miscreants and troublemakers of all stripes and a thriving market for slaves and chems moving up and down the coast. Run by a number of gangs unified through clever words and ruthless action alike by Granger Storm and her crew, she holds ambitions of growing her holdings into the largest and most power crime hub on the west coast. Accomplishing that will be easier said than done however with the black armored ghosts of Washington, unruly slaves and rampant chem addiction all rearing their ugly heads around the Maw. The best they might be able to manage is throwing their lot in with the might of the Immortal."
  BDT_OWB_DESC:0 "The Bonedancers are a group of ritualistic raiders heralding from a old PMC tasked with protecting a Future-Tec research facility. Armed with a stash of weapons and a decent supply of G.E.C.K. components ( Even if they didn't really understand how to use them ) they proceeded to dominate eastern Oregon. In recent years they have been falling victim to several foreign influences. From strange cultists to religious pilgrims!\n\nIt is now the year 2275 and it remains to be seen if Cranium can hold the Bonedancers together - or will another take hold of the Bonedancers?"
  MLT_OWB_DESC:0 "N'Gasta! Kvata! Kvakis!\nFrom the western shores of Oregon a dark tribe rules. Their tongues are twisted and minds rotten - they feel that to live in the wastes one must live like a beast, that only primordial and hidden knowledge can bring survival in this cruel world.\nThe Coral Court, a mysterious body rules over the Mirelurk Tribe. They guide them and preach the glory of the great god M'lulu, a monsterous Mirelurk Queen whom the Mirelurk Tribe revere as a god.\nThe kingdom of man will sink below the waves, and the kingdom of M'Lyeh will mantle its crown."
  DIS_OWB_DESC:0 "Decimation lay at the feet of those that revere the Ruddy Man's teachings- having been exiled from their homes the Apostles now must rebuild after fighting a bloody war for survival with cannibals. The stress of the situation weighs heavily on their minds, whether they can hold this home, or even reclaim their old tribe weighs even more so heavily. As Prophet Vadim must decide, should they attempt to make a deal with monsters? Or become the champions of the kingdom of man?"
  PAS_OWB_DESC:0 "These days, the Canadian Rockies are home to a melting pot of wanderers, exiles, and vagrants from across the Great North. The Wardens of the White's "Foxtrot Uniform" have just recently joined these ranks, having been chased out of Seattle by the Immortal's advance. They are led by Sylvia Harlowe, who has taken it upon herself to extend a helping hand to those who came before.\n\nWith the bulk of the Wardens' remnants holed up in Spokane, the ranks of the Foxtrot Uniform are gripped by fierce debate over the future of the unit.  Sylvia walks a political tightrope, torn between the grievances of her men and her desire to do right by the people of the Pass. And all the while, fires continue to rage all around her..."
  HGH_OWB_DESC:0 "High above their holy river, the High Chapel parishes watch the world flow by. The last force for peace in the region, the rise of Heaven's Gate and the catastrophe of Great Schism have led to a policy of retraction in foreign affairs by the baptisers.\n\nThough peace may reign, there are many who fear that this inaction cannot last, and that when the time has come for the holy to be weighed and measured, they will be found mortally wanting."
  NAV_OWB_DESC:0 "The Navajo have lived in the southwest for centuries, and survived wave after wave of conquerors. The Spaniards, the Mexicans, and the Americans could not break them. Caesar, to them, is just one more in a line of great powers to adapt to. Although the Navajo are, in theory, subjects of the Legion, the Navajo view their relationship as once of equals. The tribe's councils are divided between those who wish to work with the Legion and the riches it brings, and those who dream of making the Navajo masters of their fate once again."
  SHI_OWB_DESC:0 "From the sea the Shi came, upon a sacred vessel under the guidance of the Emperor of China himself. Blessed with his wisdom, advanced technology and longstanding martial traditions the Shi have thrived and grown into a strong if small community. \n\nThe Chosen One and the rise of the NCR put cracks in the wall of isolation that the Shi once maintained and with the world around them now changing rapidly there are many within the Shi that wonder if a new way is required."
  SOK_OWB_DESC:0 "Arroyo should belong to Kaga, and he should have been given the title of the Chosen One. Both of these prizes were denied him by cruel fate however, despite all his best efforts. In the years since the fall of the Enclave and the rise of the false Chosen One Kaga has built a tribe of his own, still burning with ambition. \n\nThere are rivals to face in the wilds of Nevada but when those rivals have fallen and TV Town with them, perhaps Kaga will be free to plan a homecoming..."
  DES_OWB_DESC:0 "When the Desert Rangers shook hands with the NCR and became a part of the grand governmental machine, there were some who looked upon that merging with contempt in their hearts. Abigail Lee, chief among them, eventually took those who shared her views further into the desert to start anew. \n\nIn the wastelands of Nevada, there are many who look to build fortunes or empires and Abigail's rangers must find a way to pacify them so that they make a new future for themselves free of the NCR. If such a thing is even possible..."
  TVT_OWB_DESC:0 "The Show Must Go On! So the Director says, day in and day out, and so it does. We play our parts and never question why or for how long we must play. Who knows what would happen should we do so. \n\nBut... what if?"
  GRD_OWB_DESC:0 "When Maxson's first radio calls were sent out across the wasteland following the Great War not all of the army detachments that agreed with Maxson's orders and doctrines simply chose to stick with that tradition. The Guardians were one such offshoot diverting from tradition and evolving separately from the Brotherhood. Superstitious, and consumed by their own religious beliefs on the dangers of language as well as technology, contact with Lost Hills was severed an age ago. \n\nSuch things are apt to change however, and while they step into the Esmeralda Valley as Guardians, who can say what they may be when they step out?"
  TOF_OWB_DESC:0 "When the Farfield Rebellion was put down by the soldiers of New Canaan they couldn't simply execute the survivors - they had to repent. As such, the 215th chain gang were sentenced to work in the city of Jericho in the hopes of atoning for their sins. That is, until Thunderbird and the 80s ransacked the city, smashing through the salvaged and ruined city that the 215th had labored so long to build up. The 215th were free, yet they needed a place to go. \n\nNow Marianne, a former thief turned indentured servant turned gang leader, has brought them west in search of both a shelter away from their former masters and the fabled treasure of the valley."
  ### Mexico ###
  MEX_NAME:0 "Mexico"
  MEX_DESC:0 "£GFX_mexico_overlay                                                   A land of preserved and mutated national beauty, Mexico's sweeping vistas are lightly dusted with radiation, thick with bandidos and those who oppose them. Its population lives day to day under a warm sun, cutting through mutated jungles to prospect forgotten cities, leading caravans from the seat of democracy to the halls of an empire. Pre-war cartels who once dominated the entire country continue to operate in the modern day, with drastically fewer clientèle, and an increasingly deadlier selection of drugs and services. American influence can still be felt in territories immediately south of the Rio Grande, where the descendants of American occupiers pass the torch of democracy to their fellow Mexicans.\n\nThe American Army didn't just leave their offspring throughout the north of Mexico. Nestled at the crossroads of their troop and resource networks, a vast military complex whose name has been lost to time stares out at the world with dead eyes. Clicking away deep within its heart, beneath layers of the best automated security America had to offer, Tlaloc resides. Petro-Chico's very own A.I., a military super-computer sold to them by the Americans in return for the rights to occupy Mexico and molest its resources. Tlaloc was charged with ensuring the flow of oil from Mexico to America, keeping facilities and people safe. Almost two hundred years later, it is alone, and falling apart at the seams as its own sub-processes threaten to erase and replace it."
  RRG_OWB_DESC:0 "One of the only pre-war countries to remain after the apocalypse, the Republic of the Rio Grande is a hollow shell of its former self. Surviving the collapse in no small part thanks to the American soldiers within its borders deserting to save civilian lives, the Republic redefined itself in order to survive.\n\nWith the rise of democracy came many challenges, and a long line of presidents have faithfully served the Republic in order to keep its people safe and happy. Despite this, tensions are running high as the Texan Arms Association continues to grow more and more discontent."
  ARM_OWB_DESC:0 "Formed by an insane and powerful splinter of Tlaloc that believes itself to be the reincarnation of Santa Anna, the Army of Mexico is an army with a nation, not a nation with an army. Santa Anna's iron grasp on his population ensures full \"cooperation\" with his forces at all times. \n\nDriven by a desire to redeem himself for the shame of his \"past actions\", the mad AI strives to improve his conscript army and fill out its ranks with robots. Living conditions are poor, working conditions are poorer, and suffering is ignored. Everything is done in service to the reconquest of Mexico: if humans must suffer for that? So be it."
  ATE_OWB_DESC:0 " Originating in the city states of South Mexico, in what was once Morales and Puebla, the Aztlán exploded outwards and grew their borders in a relatively short amount of time. Their greatest weapon was the Priesthood of Xochicalco, a collection of telepathic mutants from whom the imperial dynasty arose. The Aztlán reign supreme from the great city state of Tepic in the west to the shockingly pristine coast of Acapulco Bay in the east. Their bountiful mutant terrain lends itself well to crop cultivation, and they boast one of the largest populations in the Wasteland. But now the Speaker sees a dark future ahead of the Empire, one only she can preserve it from. But will anyone else agree with her?"
  PET_OWB_DESC:0 "Descended from the workers, executives, and civilians who were on-site at the Petro-Chico Corporation's industrial facilities when the Great War began, the current inhabitants of Petro-Chico are a shadow of their ancestors. They squat in the ruins of pre-war refinieres, leaving them to deteriorate, eking out a meager existence.\n\nAlthough Tlaloc considers them company employees, the residents of Petro-Chico are isolationist to a fault, and have rejected every attempt the A.I. has ever made to improve the quality of their lives. They fester in their perishing facilities, ignorant of their true worth."
  FFI_OWB_DESC:0 "Surrounded by cartels on all sides, hounded by drug pushers and pimps with mercenary armies, the Free Fighters have maintained their liberty by force. Luchadores of all shapes and sizes create and don unique masks, fighting with brass knuckles and shotgun gauntlets against anyone and everyone. \n\nA pantheon of famous pre-war luchadores forms the core of their identity, enabling them to determine their own qualities through the luchadores they revere at any one given time. They are known to play both face and heel—good guy and bad guy—as it suits them."
  ITZ_OWB_DESC:0 "The Itza originated from a tribe who worshiped the Mayan Gods at Chichen Itza, but the Empire rapidly spread its tendrils through the Yucatan peninsula and the Gulf Coast, establishing themselves as a dominant regional power, until the Aztlán arrived. \n\nThe Aztlán defeated the Itzan forces twice, until Sebastián, then an officer, rallied the Itzan forces at Battle of the Papaloapan River to drive the Aztláns back, and seized power in a coup a few years later. However, the Aztlán still stalk the borders, and new foes are arising - all while the Kalomte is getting older and older..."
  TLA_OWB_DESC:0 "Tlalocan's greatest "person" of interest is her namesake; a pre-war supercomputer named "Tlaloc" after the Aztec god of rain. Tlaloc's primary motivation is the preservation of humanity, and the business interests it once represented; primarily those of the Petro Chico company. Though it has catered to these diligently for the last 200 years, Tlaloc is plagued with instability; having segmented himself into many alter egos based on notable Mexicans from the past. The repercussions of Tlaloc's Demise, and which of God's children will rise in his place remains to be seen."
  CAF_OWB_DESC:0 "Once merely a bit player on the Mexican stage, Costa Cafeinada has taken the ascendant in the falling shadows of its neighbouring empires. Uninterested in glory or conquest, the Baron's desire for wealth and an economic monopoly is only thinly checked by lip-service obeisance to the Aztlan throne. But the bounds of subserviance will not hold Costa back for long, and everyone who's anyone knows that when it comes to the long con, you don't bet against the baron."
  TDT_OWB_DESC:0 "Standing between the titans of Nuevo Aztlán and the Itzan Empire, the Mayan peoples of Chiapas have formed their own nation as a fragment of the Itzan Empire. The two split on religious grounds, and a strong separatist sentiment remains widespread, partly inspired by Sajal Tobias Rey II's decades of success in holding off both Itzan and Aztlan invading forces. Now that Itzan-Aztlan relations are deteriorating once more, however, it seems the people of Tzotzil may have to pick a side - or else be forced into one..."
  TVR_OWB_DESC:0 "The Viceroyal spun off from Nuevo Aztlán when they realized they were within the lands Tlaloc would protect from outside aggression. Why pay taxes to a blind girl if the old world god will protect its cities at no cost?  But as Tlaloc wheezes his final breaths, many wonder how long it will be before the empire comes north to reclaim what it lost."
  SIN_OWB_DESC:0 "The northern half of the Sinaloa Cartel has been licking its wounds ever since the loss of its territories to the luchadore Free Fighters. While operations in North Mexico remain profitable, the cracks in the cartel are starting to show, and another century of profitable exploitation is no longer a guarantee. \n\nWhile alone, Sinaloa is weak and isolated, but if the two cartels could be reunited once more, the moribosos of Mexico could achieve great and terrible things."
  GDH_OWB_DESC:0 "The Generalissimo is perhaps the most charismatic man in all of Mexico. Using his good looks, charms, and tactical brilliance, he has united a band of raiders into a professional military force. Others may dabble in the drug trade or protection rackets; the Generalissimo legalizes consumption and establishes a uniform tax system. As he says, why skin the cow when you can milk it? La Gente is one of the most oppressive but best run states in Mexico, and its people firmly believe that the sun upon their flag is not setting on the Pacific, but rising over Mexico. \nAnd did I mention how attractive he is?"
  BLO_OWB_DESC:0 "The splintered southern remnants of the Sinaloa cartel lie squatting in the jungle, owing their continued survival against the Free Fighters to the Bandits and his new Beltran-Levya clique. While poor in infrastructure and resources, the cartel has embraced the Bandit's brutal ways, and is preparing for a bloody reconqista against the luchadores. \n\nWhile alone, Beltran-Levya is weak and isolated, but if the two cartels could be reunited once more, the moribosos of Mexico could achieve great and terrible things. "
  GRH_OWB_DESC:0 "No one can quite agree on what lies south of the Honduras and the Darien Gap.  Some say that South America survived the Great WAr largely unscathed, and has chosen neutrality rather than deal with the improverished Wasteland. The people of Honduras claim they are the shield that guards the realm of men (and supermutants, ghouls, and robots) against an unending tide of raiders. Most of Mexico thinks they are lying through their teeth, but what if they aren't?"

  TEX_DESC:0 "£GFX_texas_overlay Ever Since the Brotherhood of Steel showed up, Texas has been a downright friendly place. Stop by the brothels of Carbon, catch a roller derby, or listen to Mr. Entertainment's crooning voice. But trouble theatens the respectable folk of Texas. The raiders of Carthage are acting up, and the robots of Santa Anna wade into the Rio Grande. Tensions smoulder along the Rio as the TAA dreams of an capitalist utopia. Rosado dreams of bringing progress and development to all the Wastes. Shale plots to revive the Master's dream.  \n\nAnd lurking on the horizon is Lanius, who comes to bring the word of Caesar to a fallen land. He will not rest until he washes his bloody sword in the Gulf. Who can stand against him? It may be time for the people of Texas to revive their old nation and motto -- 'Come and Take It!'"

  LNS_OWB_DESC:0 "Once little more than a small town on the I-20, Lone Star bloomed in the hellish aftermath of the Great War as a beacon of trade and hope. Caravans soon began to move up and down the I-20, and Lone Star rapidly expanded its city limits: quickly outstripping the ruins of the pre-war town. \n\nMore than a decade ago, Lone Star suffered a vicious insurrection at the hand of the Hand Warband.

  CMC_OWB_DESC:0 "The Great War has destroyed much, but it didn't destroy people's need for leisure time and entertainment. It also did not destroy greed and jealousy. The Chicasaw-Muscogee-Coalition are a nation steeped in all of these things. Led by Lushanya Harjo, the head of one of the biggest casino families in the nation, they are powder keg of criminal activity waiting to explode.\n\nAll the while strange things are happening to the west threatening not only them, but everyone in the region."
  CHO_OWB_DESC:0 "The Choctaw have kept the tradition of the storyteller alive through many hardships before the Great War and they have not stopped yet. Nashoba Solomon has many stories to tell himself, but nowadays he is happiest seeing his home prosper. And an opportunity opened itself up that would have not been possible before the war. Ghouls, in many regions feared or despised, can offer their stories collected over their long, long lives to the current generation. Helping to guide them and to not repeat what lead to the world they live in."
  CHR_OWB_DESC:0 "While certain groups in the wasteland fear technology for what it did to the world, the Cherokee have embraced it, even long before the Great War.

The fall of civilization in the wake of nuclear Armageddon gave rise to many tribes and cultures, whose nature seems to reflect the land they inhabit.\nThe White legs, crazy horns and tar walkers are just three of the many tribes that fight and feud over control of what might be the world's last untouched paradise.\nTravelling further north towards the great salt lake one may eventually reach New Canaan the lone beacon of knowledge that has withstood the test of time. Its inhabitants, perhaps the last members of the church of latter day saints, still carry out the work of their ancestors, seeking to spread the word to the people of the area and although some have chosen to accept their message, many more still remain in opposition.\nThe work of their missionaries is undoubtedly threatened, the undoubtedly dangerous exiles from Sac City feared under the moniker of the 80s, as well as the increasingly bold savages of the white legs tribe both seek to extend their influence in the region and the tribes might once again find themselves drawn into conflict."

They founded New Canaan over a period of difficult years, adopting an open and accepting policy for outsiders to avoid repeating the mistakes which ruined their last home.\n\nNew Canaan regularly sends missionaries out to preach the word of God, saying that any man who is baptised may live within their walls as one of their own. They regularly commune with the tribes of Utah, offering the bible, food, and communal help. New Canaan is generally well liked in Utah and treated warmly by most tribes."

There is debate amongst the men as to which glorious conquest to undertake first. Shall they ride to Ruby Valley and finish what they started, reclaim the holy road from Vault City, or sack the decadent casinos of Reno?"
  HAM_OWB_DESC:0 "While the squabbling tribes of Utah degenerated into mystic beliefs and fanaticism, The Glass-Makers chose a different path. From the sparkling streets of New Hammond to the firey desert forges, it is the craftsman, not the preacher, who is lifted up.\n\nHowever, all is not at well in New Hammond.

Now, she rules from atop the Dark Pyramid, her Daughters and Hounds spreading word and steel in equal measure. Ouroboros is a sanctuary for the broken, a temple for the faithful, and a weapon for the future. Yet beneath the reverence lies unease.

No outsider has so far been able to discover where this need to keep track of the passing of time comes from, only that it likely originates from their time in the vault and has since persisted. For one reason or another they seem to have missed the growing threat of the Whitelegs on their border."

A force dedicated to directly challenging the Amercians authority within Canada, they would outlive their enemy and continue to exert its influence within the north. Day by day, piece by piece, they attempted to unite Canada. But it was not to be. Its forces were stretched, its politics were deadly. Each misstep bringing it closer to its end; suffering a slow and bloated death. Its overextension left its core territories weak, their cries falling on deaf ears as The CPF fell victim to tunnel vision. A mass civil war occurred between the Canadian People's Front and the People's Front of Canada; further solidifying the dying regime.\n\nNow the CPF is a hollow shell of what it once was, reduced to further infighting after the death of chairman Allison Brude, causing the shattering; The CPF was no more. Now the remnants of the CPF gather themselves for one final war, with players both new and old attempting to secure their future. The mighty Kingdom of Manitoba , which had risen out of the ashes of the CPF, has fallen to ruin, as rebellions broke out within its Eastern and Western territories leading to the death of their previous king, humiliating the once great empire. Tensions rise within the Bloody Electorals as rumours of corruption spread around. The newly formed Great Stampede continues to exert its influence, bringing terror to its neighbours. All the while, Destiny continues her evil machinations hidden deep within the Manifest Facilities. The winds of change approach quickly, and the people sharpen their knives."

All that is left of this once proud nation is an old Ghoul trying to stitch his mind together with ancient whisky in hopes of remembering what was lost.\n\nThe dreams of the past haunt the snow capped mountains, with the rocket's red glare filling the dark valleys. Some still whisper of red, white, and blue, swearing that hidden beyond our own personal hell, is Uncle Sam laying in wait. As the fools whisper, there are those who wave a star spangled banner, the blue and white flag of the future they say.

Powered by a ceaseless desire and ambition to wander and grow, the Boss of the Far Son Prospectors has issued a strange, inutterable verdict: the Miners would return to the surface world, and take it for their own, one way, or another..."
  WYR_OWB_DESC:0 "The Eyrie is a wide open and fertile land under the firm thumb of its well-heeled master. In a relatively short time it has transformed from a disorganized collective of ranches and farms into an apparatus designed to squeeze wealth from the land and the people. Fueled by visions of elitism, god-fearing zeal and the blood of the tribals and small folks alike, the Baileys and other well-to-do families of the Eyrie have grand dreams. The next tribe may be one too many for them to handle however."
  KHA_OWB_DESC:0 "After the death of Darion, the New Khans were caught at an impossible crossroads. Every attempt to rise up in California was ending in pain and failure. While Papa Khan took a contingent to the Mojave, calling themselves the Great Khans, Amgalan took up a new leaf. He wanted to do better for his culture, to ensure their survival-- and the Followers of the Apocalypse were more than willing to help him find a new home for his flock. \n\nNow, in Wyoming, they must tend with the locals, welcoming new Khans into the fold... And perhaps even accepting their cousins."
  BTH_OWB_DESC:0 "When Elizaveta was but a child, an Enclave soldier saved her from certain death. That single act of charity changed her life for the better-- while her burns were severe enough to leave her saddled with one arm, she has happily used that one arm to try and bring smiles to the people of the wasteland, one pin at a time. Other groups took notice-- the Fireflies and their rituals may help keep her protected, but the Saints? Well, the Saints have always played by Archie's rules. And he would love nothing more than to test the smiles once and for all."
  MRR_OWB_DESC:0 "The Free States have endured many things over the years, even bringing their former enemies in the National Guard into the fold. Now, of course, the Marshalls have forged a modest post-war society in the desolation of Wyoming, but enemies abound. Their past relations with the Four Fathers were too sour, and they only grow more and more tense by the day as the tribals crave a return to Mount Rushmore. The Free States must prepare for a final storm, or else risk losing everything."
  STM_OWB_DESC:0 "Hark, and hear the tale of Blinding Hail, the true chosen child of GOD. The Storm Mongers are upon a neverending precipice, a darkened wisery by which they must fly kites made of manflesh to catch the eye of the LORD and better reach the great white clouds of Heaven itself. Heathens and fools abide plenty in Montana, all ripe for judgment..."
  HVR_OWB_DESC:0 "While the Storm Mongers toil away in Grand Falls, the Cult of Liberty fashions itself a different sort of madness. Foolishly inspired by imagery of Middlemark, they believe that America was not in fact a place but rather an angel destined to return to the Earth-- and the Enclave is her long dark shadow, the demons who dare to infest her carcass. The faithful must purge these insolent fools from the world, so that America may return in all her glory once and for all!"
  JCK_OWB_DESC:0 "The Jacksons were one of the First Families of Missoula once, though you could hardly tell. Though a great amount of time has passed since their exile, that doesn't make the wound any less fresh. The family has spent years raiding supply caches, ensuring they were properly prepared to take on their Enclave foes head-on- and they're finally ready, and mighty tired of waiting."
  MET_OWB_DESC:0 "How far would you go for strength? What would you give up to leave behind fatigue and rot? What pain would you endure to forever leave behind weakness?\n\nWhen exercise and training were not enough to overcome the human limits, Steel Joe and his ragtag band of followers tracked down the treasures of Billings, Montana. With the stash of pre-war implants found there, they've carved out ownership of central Montana, their rise only stymied by a crushing defeat at Missoula. If they can recover and overcome the challenges of the 2270s, their iron fists might just grab the entire Northwest Commonwealth."
  NIT_OWB_DESC:0 "From the Great Plains of Alberta to the mountains of Montana, the Niitsitapi once called much of this region home. Inch by inch, their land was taken and pushed back, until before the war they were confined to small reservations.\n\n But in obscurity, lies safety. Spared the devastation of the Great War and still maintaining traditions of sustainable self-reliance, the Niitsitapi have prospered for the past 200 years, fending off raiders, mutants, and most recently the Zack Company mercenaries. Their current War Chief Old-Gun is tired of fighting, but with the Americans back on their doorstep and his grandson burning with youth, it may be their time to reclaim all that they have lost..."

In Washington, the once-great Wardens of the White have fled across the north, splintering in each and every direction. Lance Squadron, an expedition of the great Midwestern Brotherhood that destroyed the Wardens, now bicker over Seattle and the Chain That Binds them. To the east, raiders and settlers alike east lick their wounds and scheme in the backyards of a religious crusading cult. \n\nIn Oregon, the cannibalistic tribes must combat their hunger for humans, or become slaves to it-- not unlike the emerging super mutants, marching out of their Warren in order to create a new home for their kind.  \n\nFinally, in the north, forever covered by the Whiteout, blotting out the sun as raiders storm the coast, forcing survivors backed by the monarch of Victoria to desperately defend their home, Cascadia. \n\nChange is on the wind, and it is violent, but this does not mean despair; there is hope as long as there are people to fight for it..."

  COLORADO_NAME:0 "$NEW_NAME$ Bull's Demense"
  COLORADO_DESC:0 "£GFX_colorado_overlay         The former states of New Mexico and Colorado lie in the shadow of the Bull and are scarred by past conflicts. The memory of Paullus and his cohort is still fresh as are the wounds they inflicted and the legacy of the Prisoner is still felt in the mountains.\n\nThe newest protege of Caesar, the man known as Lanius, will decide the future of these lands through his sword, his shifting loyalties, or his failures while those in his path have little choice but to prepare themselves. The goddess Diana, the digital gremlin Doki, the lords of Dog City and even the Brotherhood of Steel all lie within his path. \n\nFurther north lies a powder keg waiting only for a match to light the fire. An NCR expedition looks to claim the legendary Boulder Dome as ghoulish warlords, both Luminous and Withered, begin to make their own power plays. Looking over it all is the Black Canyon, a union on the precipice of complete collapse and standing on the doorstep of paradise. \n\nIt is not a question of whether these lands will fall into chaos but who will reign over them when it is over."

  LAC_OWB_DESC:0 "Lanius served Caesar well in the conquests of Arizona, but Caesar has given him a sacred task. Lanius will conquer the East! He shall march against New Mexico, Colorado, and, perhaps, Texas. And when it is over, he shall weep, for there are no more worlds to conquer. \n\nUntil Caesar calls him west, to test the strength of the East against the Wall of the west."
  TTM_OWB_DESC:0 "The tribes of the Wasteland whisper of a goddess who blesses their crops; The more civilized folk tell tales of a presence within the fabled halls of the Nursery, guiding a swarm of robots across Colorado for the 'Betterment of Mankind'. The truth is a little more complicated than either story! Diana Stone, perhaps the greatest scientist to survive the Great War, lives to this day as the leader of a peaceful tribe in Colorado. But change is coming, and the Wasteland cries out for mercy and kindness. Perhaps it is time for her to emerge from her machines and save the world."
  MXC_OWB_DESC:0 "Rising tensions and a desire to secure an eastern foothold, an expedition was formed in Lost Hills. Sent east to Colorado, the Maxson Expedition set out to form a new Chapter of the Brotherhood, beyond the reach of the Californian powers."
  ROB_OWB_DESC:0 "In 2068 the holodisk game Doki Doki ( £rob_doki_doki_texticon £rob_doki_doki_texticon ) was released in foreign markets by an American publisher. It was primarily a "dating simulation game" focused around a relationship with the eponymous Doki (§Pthat's me§!). One such individual within Liberty, Colorado ended up acquiring a copy, but it didn't install until after the bombs had already dropped, leaving the game on for almost two centuries..."
  LUM_OWB_DESC:0 "Born within the Glowing Cradle, the faithful of the Eternal Luminous Glow followed their Great founder into the Houndlands seeking new converts. For Ghouldom is a holy gift and one that must be spread to all mankind, sheltering them from the evils of time, age, and death. And should the people not listen, gripped instead by fear or spiritual corrosion? Then the blessing of radiation will be brought to them by any means necessary. \n\nYet treachery will bar them from their home, and they will be left stranded before the coming storm. Should they survive, more tests of faiths, not least of all the march to their homeland lie before them. They need but weather them, for the salvation of all Ghouls must surely spread."
  BAG_OWB_DESC:0 "The Second Colorado Expedition, known by its colloquial name "The Baggers", has returned to where the first one arrived over two decades ago. Many of the faces in the Expedition are the same as they were back then, albeit older, wiser, and perhaps more bitter.\n\nThis time they are mercifully free of the diabolical machinations of Victor Presper, but they are still in grave danger. Beset on both sides by hostile Ghoulish forces, the Expedition is also torn internally between different approaches to their mission. The Baggers face a Sisyphean task; to survive, conquer, and race to save Boulder Dome's ZAX from destroying itself."
  WHD_OWB_DESC:0 "Life within the borders of the Hangdogs territory can be difficult, especially if you're \"abnormal\" in some shape or form. Deeply suspicious of outsiders and mutants, the Hangdogs regularly drive ghouls out of their territory, and deny them entry to their settlements.\n\nGhouls go where ghouls are, hoping to find respite from prejudice with their own kind. As such, when a ghoul settlement was established north of the Hangdogs, most ghouls who were ejected from their territory simply moved north. For many, a difficult is life is better than a life of segregation, even if your leader is a 'Withered Dog'."
  GLW_OWB_DESC:0 "Stage lights flicker a sickly green. A glowing ghoul in a ragged bomber jacket and a half-melted mic shuffles up to the stage.\n"People say the Glow Bugs are in a prime strategic spot. Yeah—prime like a radroach on a barbeque grill! To the west? Caravan Council, where leadership turnover's faster than my skin shedding. South, we've got the Hangdogs—real charmers, if you like your diplomacy loud and covered in bite marks. And east? The Houndlands. That ain't a nation, it's a dare."\nA boo cuts through the haze. "Yeah, I hear you, Stitches! Lose one leader slot and suddenly you're Shecky Greene."\n\nHe grins, radioactive teeth gleaming. "But we're still standin'. We got Boulder Dome tech, a little glow, and me—Patches, your irradiated MC. Sure, half the time we're frying raiders with plasma, other half we're stuck behind a mountain playing twenty questions while Black Canyon's playing twenty civil wars. But hey—we're bugs, baby. We crawl through worse.""
  CIP_OWB_DESC:0 "In the 10x20 years since the great subtraction, the Ciphers of the West have largely been content to travel their ancient circuit through the valleys of the Rockies, only setting down roots within the walls of Mesa Verde. Lying within is the ancient computer containing the knowledge their ancestors saved from Los Alamos; knowledge that was carved onto the walls of the Kiva in sacred schematics as the machines power ran low. Mathematics pervades every day life for the tribe, from their speech to their rituals and mannerisms.\n\nDog City to the north has suffered it's own series of subtractions in recent years, leaving multiple groups of exiles and refugees looking to add themselves to the mountain passes to disturb the Ciphers peace, hard won over the raiders of the Dark Moon 5x4 years past. While the tribe does not relish violence, it is as much a tool as a calculator and the variables are becoming too numerous to resist forever. The equation must solve itself, but will the Ciphers be the remainder?"
  SUF_OWB_DESC:0 "Clustered around the an old world fort and equipped with the remainder of its old arsenal lies a disparate federation of settlements and folks. Here at Summers this collection of folks drawn from all over the area agree mainly on three things: living free, the joy of explosives, and flipping off of the Legion. Many of the federations people were displaced by Paullus in years past, and the looming shadow of the Bull has not been forgotten.\n\nAs the new Legate Lanius begins on his journey to greatness, it is to Summers that the folk of New Mexico will flee. Such refugees will need to band together with the rest of the Federation to have any hope of resisting the Butcher of the East. Should they manage to survive the Federation may become the birthplace of a new and stronger nation, but for now survival will be hard enough."
  BLC_OWB_DESC:0 "Black Canyon began as a dream of unity—raiders, settlers, and tribals, all brought together beneath the old rotunda of Tibbets Penitentiary. Battery of Mesa Verde, once a companion of Prisoner 13, helped forge that dream into something real: a fragile confederation balancing between war and peace. At its heart is the Big Top, a prison-turned-capital, where the echoes of old sins still rattle the bars.\nBut unity doesn't come easy. The Painted Men demand reverence for their ink-bound gods, the Yampan Coalition fights for trade and freedom, and the raiders of Tibbets eye every treaty with a blade behind their back. Battery keeps them together—barely. Each Grand Gathering is a gamble, each quiet day a warning. Black Canyon survives not by strength alone, but by constant negotiation, constant compromise... and the hope that its pieces won't fly apart before the next storm rolls in."
  TOB_OWB_DESC:0 "The Old Bones were once a quiet tribal people living near Farson, surviving by the old ways—hunting, trading, and honoring the spirits of great beasts whose bones they wore as armor. That peace ended when the Mole Miners came, rising from the ground in fire and gas to slaughter everything in their path. Their homeland gone, the survivors followed a single figure—the Nameless—who rose from the ashes and led them south through ruin and memory. Now they gather around the Monument, a place of fossil giants and old stories, trying to rebuild what was lost… or become something new entirely."
  IRN_OWB_DESC:0 "The Iron Alliance came to New Sterling as wanderers, tribals, mercenaries, and smiths without a home. The city once housed a great factory—an Acme Forge used by the so-called Menace from the West to churn out machines of war. Now, under Iron hands, it burns again—shaping armor, weapons, and purpose. With the fall of Denver, caravans and warbands alike travel east in search of steel, and even the Legion casts a hungry eye toward New Sterling's forges. What began as survival has become something greater: a creed built in flame, and a city that dreams in iron."
