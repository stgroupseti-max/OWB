    NOE_NOE_DESC:0 "Before Noe, the Noemen did not have a name. A collection of strange ghouls and mutants having immigrated as far as they could from the west so that they could find peace in the world in their own, special way. It was only recently that the Noemen were forced into hiding, the eponymous Noe helping to keep the mutants hidden in the caves as the Eighties roared overheard. Soon, they learned to follow him."
