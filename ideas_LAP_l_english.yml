  lap_idea_beastlord_migrants_desc:0 "The Beastlords, masters of their subterranean catacombs to the southeast, were fractured during the chaos of Petra's Run. Reduced trade with the Brotherhood, in addition to a heavy drought, drove a few reformers to attempt to abandon their cannibalistic ways, believing they must atone for the sudden loss of prosperity. Their choice, seen as heresy, led to their banishment from the catacombs.\n\nSeeking refuge, the exiled Beastlords ventured north to Sacred Cloud, the heart of the Lakota Nation. The Lakota, wary but compassionate, recognized echoes of Wakan Tanka in the Beastlords' reverence for the creatures they held close. Initial mistrust gave way to understanding as the two peoples found common ground in their shared connection to the land. The Beastlords, skilled hunters and mystics, taught the Lakota of their strange crystal rituals and the ways of their beasts, while the Lakota offered their knowledge of the plains, wisdom of survival, and traditions of kinship.\n\nTogether, they forged an uneasy but growing alliance. They hunted as one, their spears and beasts cutting through the wilds. Around fires, they taught each other their languages, bridging divides with stories and shared struggles. Plans to take the Oahe Dam—a source of water and power—emerged from their council circles, a symbol of their future aspirations. In the northern wilds, the Beastlords and Lakota now stand together; bound by the hope of reclaiming a place in the world."

  lap_idea_ghost_dance_desc:0 "In the wake of the New Plague, the United States government established the Cordon Solitaire, a massive no-go zone encompassing Nebraska to contain the infected. This directly threatened the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, who had suffered no major outbreaks, yet were being asked to leave their ancestral lands. Viewing it as a violation of their sovereignty, the Pine Ridge Lakota fiercely protested the Cordon Solitaire. Despite this, the U.S. military forcibly removed them, driving them beyond the exclusion zone's borders.\n\nThe injustice ignited a shared movement among the Lakota and neighboring First Nations. In grief and defiance, they revived the Ghost Dance—a sacred tradition born in the 19th century, promising the return of the ancestors, the renewal of Grandmother Earth, and deliverance from oppression. This new Ghost Dance was like the old, but took on deeper urgency, fueled by loss. Reports of strange phenomena—unexplained lights and visions—drew the attention of Tulsa's Office of Unusual Research, but the U.S. dismissed their findings as mass hysteria. Attempts to suppress the dances only spread their reach. Tribes as distant as the Yakama and Choctaw Nations sent emissaries to join the movement, united in protest and reverence.\n\nThe Ghost Dances persisted until the Great War, and beyond. With the United States gone, the dances became a cultural cornerstone—a testament to resilience and a sacred bridge between history, spirit, and an unshackled future."

  lap_idea_lakota_faith_desc:0 "Long ago, the Pine Ridge Lakota and the Standing Rock Lakota stood as one, united in purpose and tradition. Their bond was cemented through the fire council, where both nations gathered to share wisdom, plan their futures, and participate in the sacred Ghost Dance rituals. These ceremonies, steeped in reverence for Wakan Tanka and the ancestral spirits, symbolized their shared hope for restoration and the healing of Grandmother Earth. Together, they embodied resilience and unity against the challenges of a changing world.\n\nBut as years passed, cracks began to form in their alliance. The Pine Ridge Lakota, driven by an unyielding desire to reclaim their sacred lands within the forbidden Cordon Solitaire, became restless. For them, the exclusion zone, though fraught with danger, was a wound in the Earth that demanded healing—a scar left upon their heritage that could not be ignored. They saw piercing the Cordon as a spiritual necessity, a rite of reclamation and defiance against the forces that had displaced them.\n\nThe Standing Rock Lakota, however, saw things differently. To them, the risks of breaching the Cordon far outweighed the rewards. They feared that any intrusion could unleash horrors from the exclusion zone into their lands, endangering their people and shattering the fragile balance they had fought so hard to maintain. Their voices within the fire council grew firm, urging caution and imploring the Pine Ridge Lakota to abandon their pursuit. Frustrated by what they perceived as the Standing Rock Lakota's unwillingness to act, the Pine Ridge Lakota withdrew from the fire council altogether. What had once been a united front splintered, leaving both bands to walk separate paths."
