  #Advisor Descriptions #With help from my wonderful wife Meat Girl - Iron
  MET_leroy_brown_army_chief_desc:0 "Said to have rolled in all the way from Dog City, Leroy’s stood behind Steel Joe since the early days of his rise, the slab of muscle backing up Joe’s plans. Not that Joe is a slacker in that regard, but Leroy is the largest member of the Mouths by a good margin, and puts it to use keeping rowdy upstarts in line or crashing gunlines on raids in equal measure. While not one for complex strategies, his ability to point the gang at a target and smash through the opposition is unmatched. He and Tammy are in an ongoing struggle for who’s second in the gang and who’s third, seemingly trading off every month based on who’s cracked the most bones."
  MET_tungsten_tammy_army_chief_desc:0 "Acquiring a pair of shiny arm replacements finally gave Tammy the confidence to drop her crippling Buffout addiction. Now smashing skulls with her super sledge gives all the highs she needs. \n\nStrong enough to break through an enemy strongpoint but clever enough to make someone else do it, Tungsten's one of the chief commanders of the Mouths nowadays, contesting Leroy for who gets the best targets."
  MET_mercury_high_command_desc:0 "A real piece of work that drifted in from Standing Rock. Left of her own accord apparently, though we can’t get a word out of her as to why. Fits right in though. She's got a nasty mouth, foul temper, and - thanks to the implants - an assortment of methods for dealing with anyone who gets on her bad side."
  MET_leadhead_louie_high_command_desc:0 "They said it couldn't be done, but old Louie's skull was replaced 100% and he's as fine as he ever was. Some of the guys find the sight of his baby blues peeking out of the head of a sentry bot unsettling, but he's certainly not complaining."
  MET_crazy_harry_high_command_desc:0 "A pyrotechnics and demolitions expert with wild eyes, a mad cackle, a heart of gold (steel, actually) and an insatiable desire to create chaos via explosions. Harry's shabby appearance is a direct result of his propensity for sudden explosives tests. This guy loves blowing stuff up, basically. He's got such a strong compulsion to detonate that the crew have had to learn to pick their words carefully, lest they set him (and, subsequently, a mound of c4) off."
  MET_general_mayhem_high_command_desc:0 "We have no idea where this guy came from. Says his mama was one of Steel Joe's old flames from back in the day, but since he keeps changing the details every time he tells the story, no one can figure out if that's true or not. I still think we should leave him in a ditch somewhere, but this particular looney is a good enough fighter that we can't justify dropping him."
  MET_rusty_nose_navy_chief_desc:0 "Named not for rust on his nose, but his love for the smell of it. Particularly sunken metal in salt water, slowly falling apart under assault from the brine. Given we're hundreds of miles from any major body of salt water, he's mostly stuck with filling bathtubs. We've left him in charge of the handful of river boats we've captured, not that they amount to much.\n\nRumors say he plays poker with Ol' Iron Tooth on Thursdays, but no one has ever seen it and lived."
  MET_stormy_dan_air_chief_desc:0 "A former member of the Storm Mongers, exiled for religious differences with the current leadership. Or so he tells us. It certainly wasn’t for lack of love towards airplanes and flight! The man goes on and on about touching the sky, trying to get support to scavenge better equipment to upgrade his personal fighter, or even get others to join him in the air. Not a lot of success so far, so we still mostly sell parts to Blinding Hail’s bunch.... But maybe one day things will go his way."
  MET_braxton_bronze_air_chief_desc:0 "We found this kid half dead and lying face down in the crater of a plane crash, mumbling something about a vertibird. Paula took pity on him and brought him into the gang. He's a whiz in a plane and a complete show-off, nearly getting himself killed by pulling off stupid stunts, gunning down radscorpions in his plane, and indulging in other general dumbass-itude."
  MET_chrome_feaster_theorist_desc:0 "Once a rising star in the gang, charismatic, decked out in top quality implants and considerably more tactically adept than many in the gang, few expected his sudden fall. While fighting at Missoula, MacArthur's elite soldiers fell upon Chrome's squad at the peak of the raid. With nearly nothing in their arsenal capable of piercing Power Armored troops, he could only watch as the closest thing he had to a family was gunned down by plasma fire.\n\nSince returning as the only survivor of his position, he's been lost to the idea of revenge. His days are spent seeking solutions to the problem that is PA, testing weapons and theorizing tactics that might work against them. No one’s gonna know how successful he is til the next big fight, although the newcomers in Montana may offer quite the test run...."
  MET_kalium_shepherd_theorist_desc:0 "Born sickly and with a frail body, Kalium developed an unrelenting hatred for the other members of Havre that ridiculed them for struggling to do the same hard labor others easily could. Steel Joe recognized in Kalium a mind capable of devising the most torturous methods for dispatching entire townships and gave them the means to carry them out."
  MET_iron_tooth_theorist_desc:0 "Ol' Iron Tooth is a strange one. He walked into our borders one day, aged, grizzled, cloaked and mysterious, “petitioning” Steel Joe for an offer. Said he wanted to “study” how we modified ourselves, how our bodies reacted to the implants and augments. In return for this, he’d give us some of his own knowledge to help us out, although only the boss knows the full details. Guess he heard something he liked, cause Joe gave Iron Tooth a lab to do his work, part of an old Billings hospital, a shrouded place no one can enter without his say so. All sorts of rumors and theories have cropped up about him and the source of his medical knowledge, although facts are hard to come by. The only true clue anyone’s got is Louie swears he saw a wooden charm around the old man’s neck, carved like some kinda wolf’s head."
  MET_copper_robert_economic_advisor_desc:0 "Rob used to rummage around through old buildings and strip the copper wiring from its rubber coating with his teeth. He still gets shocked even after the implants, but he says he likes it now."
  MET_gold_roger_economic_advisor_desc:0 "He thinks he's clever with a name like that and that gold tooth smile of his. An annoying sonuvabitch who keeps all the good stuff for himself. Still, he has a way of bringing in the caps, so who's complaining."
  MET_rajata_svarna_economic_advisor_desc:0 "Tiny, stubborn, and the shrewdest Metal Mouth in Montana, she honestly doesn't need the implants to talk your average moron into forking over every cap he's ever made. The laser rifle she's always packing probably helps, though."
  MET_stan_wolfram_economic_advisor_desc:0 "Stan never took too well to the whole implant thing after coming over from Heaven's Gate. He only ever got the one eye done, but he's managed to use it to get a lot done in the management department. Since he came long, no one's had to go hungry for more than a couple days."
  MET_molly_b_dennet_economic_advisor_desc:0 "Old Molly B. Dennet has herself a reputation for being the absolute best at cracking safes and opening lockers, doors and any other thing with a lock you can think of. She usually does it with explosives, but her mechanical fingers work great as lockpicks, too. If only we could get her to stop hoarding caps and burying them around camp..."
  MET_handy_danny_economic_advisor_desc:0 "One of the only merchants crazy enough to make dealing with the Metal Mouths their main source of income, and the leader of the only caravan allowed to travel all around their territory without hassle. She trades loot they don’t want (or can’t use) after their raids in return for supplies from the settlements far enough away to not recognize the origin of her wares. Top cap is given to the ever more rare find of an implant or prosthesis, usually dug up by scavengers with no knowledge of how to utilize them.\n\nShe won their respect by winning a metal forearm from a member of the gang in a wager, and letting them take her left arm that afternoon to implant it. Of course, it wasn’t til she woke up that they told her she hadn’t won the hand with it, but she goes along with the joke to this day to maintain her best customers."
  MET_oz_meum_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "Not all of us are violent weirdos obsessed with fighting and stealing and implants. Some of us also like to use our implants for the pursuit of fine arts. Oz likes making human pretzels, for example."
  MET_genny_legrand_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "Someone's gotta be the diplomatic type and Genny fits the bill. With her minor implants and cool head, she's the perfect candidate for reaching out to other communities. And if they don't accept our diplomacy, she can crush their skulls like the best of us."
  MET_heidi_garum_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "Heidi's got chrome legs for days since she got the old chop 'n' swap from the Doc, a perfect addition to the arms she got last week. Plus they're strong enough to crush a ghoul's skull. Form and function in one purdy package."
  MET_doc_ripper_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "A Mr. Orderly specialized to perform Prosthetic Surgery before the Great War, who was awoken by the Metal Mouths to help run the surgery center Auto-Docs and perform minor spot treatments. The “Doc” got its nickname from the combination of effortless skill and complete disregard for patient comfort it displays."
  MET_tinny_tim_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "This guy showed up outta nowhere one day, prancing around and makin' jokes. At first, we were just gonna smash him into paste, but he's a real wiz with that tiny guitar of his so we decided to keep him."
  MET_paula_dium_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "Resident cook and oldest of the metal mouths, Paula's dedicated herself to good old-fashioned cooking. Unfortunately for the rest of us, her (literal) iron stomach means some of those "old-fashioned home cooked meals" taste like dirt. Still, food's food."
  MET_chopjaw_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "Some folks are born to fight, and some are born to also fix stuff in their spare time. While he goes on the occasional raid to help out and gather material, Chowjaw’s real love is repairing anything and everything that breaks down. Weapons, tools, electronics, you name it. Of course, he’s got a tendency to put his own “modifications” on anything he works on, and has a bizarre aesthetic sense all his own. Also, talks to himself while he works, which more than a few folk find annoying."
  MET_meat_mouth_high_command_desc:0 "Keeping up with Steel Joe is a difficult task for even the most enhanced of Metal Mouths, but there is one member of the gang who can hang without a single augment. Meat Mouth, who named himself shortly after joining the crew, is a massive lump of a Super Mutant. Not particularly clever but surprisingly amiable for someone prone to eating captives, the mutant has become a respected raid leader amongst his human counterparts. Smashing, crashing, bashing and mashing are Meat Mouth's favorite tactics, and he's especially fond of peeling open armored foes in search of canned food."

  MET_STEEL_JOE_NAME:0 "Steel Joe"
  MET_STEEL_JOE_DESC:0 "§gIn the Montanan wastes, Steel Joe portrays himself as a striking figure whose origins are as raw and turbulent as the world around him. Once a nameless slave in the unforgiving Midwest, Joe's journey from servitude to becoming the formidable leader of the Metal Mouths gang is a story of audacity, transformation, and unrelenting ambition.\n\nFrom how he likes to tell the story, Joe is nothing less than the embodiment of grit and defiance, ruthlessly eliminating his oppressive overseer, triggering a daring uprising that ushered in a new era for himself and his fellow slaves. Proclaiming a united vision of self-improvement, Joe evolved into a charismatic leader who skillfully assembled the diverse collective of settlers, miners, and those seeking a different path into the soon-to-be raider group. His unwavering commitment to their well-being furthers his rise in both power, skill, and ego.\n\nYet in spite of this newfound success, Joe's journey toward power was anything but smooth. Faced with the limitations of the human body, he sought solace in technology, embarking on a journey to Billings, Montana, a city characterized by its fascination with cybernetic enhancements, later known to Joe and the Metal Mouths as The Metal. Joe's choice to embrace this "Metal" path marked a turning point, igniting the evolution and near-transcendence of the Metal Mouths gang from petty human raiders to fearsome machinations of metal and flesh.\n\nAs the fearsome leader of the Metal Mouths, Steel Joe commands respect through a combination of relentless training, strategic brutality, and his own cybernetic enhancements. With an iron grip on his followers, Joe's ambitions lead him to challenge the local powers of Montana. Yet, his quest for supremacy came crashing down when he encountered an adversary, armed with technology superior to his own. Joe's once-unstoppable empire faced a reckoning, challenging his perception of invincibility and forcing him to reassess. With newfound anger and vengeance, he sets his sight on the MacArthur folk.§!\n\n§RHe will not be defeated again.§!"
